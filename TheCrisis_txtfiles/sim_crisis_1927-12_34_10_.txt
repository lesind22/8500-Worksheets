INSURANCE IS ONE THING 
THAT CANNOT BE BOUGHT 
WHEN IT IS NEEDED

Most wants of the average person can be secured whenever there is need of 
such things. That is why so many people say or believe that if they have the 
money, they can get what they want, when they want it. But it is quite different 
with insurance protection. That is one need that will not come within the pur- 
view of the old adage, ‘We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.” 


No one can secure a fire insurance policy or coverage when a building is on 
fire. Neither can a ship owner cover his ship and cargo with marine insurance 
when the vessel is sinking on the deep. That is why all sensible people carry 
insurance at all times on their property and goods, and on the most valuable 
thing on the face of the earth, the human body. 


Of course some people do wait until they find their health impaired, and 
then by stealth secure insurance protection; or by concealing their true age, 
when if the true age were known, no insurance could be secured. But such cases, 
though numerous, are no more honorable and right than if such persons put 
their hands into the pockets or tills of someone and extracted money that did not 
belong to them. 


The honorable and sensible thing to do is to secure insurance when in good, 
sound health, and carry it until the time of need. And the best kind of insur- 
ance to have in time of sickness, accident or death is the 3-in-1 Superior Policy, 
issued by the Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc.

RISIS 


ESSE BINGA, the youngest in a 

family of ten children, eight girls 
and two boys, was born April 10, 
1865, in Detroit, Michigan. His 
father, William W. Binga, was born 
in 1817 in Malden, now Ambherst- 
burg, Ontario, and his mother, Adel- 
phia Powers Binga, was born near 
Rochester, N. Y. He was educated 
in the public schools of Detroit, leav- 
ing school when. in the third year of 
High School. During this time, his 
mother was the owner of considerable 
property and his spare hours were 
spent in collecting rents and keeping up 
the repairs on the property; and thus 
he laid the foundation for his later 
success in the real estate field. 

After attending High School, his 
mother placed him in the law offices 
of Thomas Crisup, the first colored 
graduate of the University of Michi- 
gan at Ann Arbor. He studied there 
for about two years when his desire 
to go West got the better of him and 
he left Detroit in 1885. 


FTER closing out his interest in 

some real estate which his 
mother had given him, he fitted out 
his chum, purchased tickets for two 
and together they started for Los An- 
geles, California. They stopped in 
Chicago and Kansas City, Mo., where 
his chum was taken ill. He remained 
there working as a barber in the shop 
of Dan Lucas at Ninth & Main Streets 
until his chum, who refused to con- 
tinue the journey West, had recov- 
ered. Then giving his chair at the 
barber shop to his friend, he made his 
way to the Northwest, stopping at 
St. Paul, Minnesota, and Helena and 
Missoula, Montana. Here his uncle 
Jordan Binga, who had migrated from 
Canada in the early fifties, was inter- 
ested in a restaurant, mining and real 
estate. From Missoula he went to 
Tacoma, Washington, where he 
opened a barber shop, later selling it 
and moving on to a more prosperous 
city, Seattle, where the greater por- 
tion of the business district had been 
destroyed by fire. Here he opened an- 
other shop in a tent and was one of 
the squatters on the water front. His 
father had run a barber shop for years 
in Detroit and taught him the trade 
in his youth. 

That year the exposures in the heavy 
rainy reason impaired his health and, 
unable to hold out any longer, he sold 
his tent barber shop, his flat boat and 
his squatter’s rights and bent his way 
toward San Francisco and Oakland, 
Calitornia. In Oakland he did his 
last barbering and laid his razor to 
rest in Stewart’s Barber Shop at 964

watch chain which was made of nug- 
gets that were washed in the pans of 
the placer miners in California. 


FTER leaving the service of the 
Southern Pacific, he promised 
himself that if he ever got east of the 
mountains, he would never take up a 
permanent residence on the west coast 


between Colfax and Truckee, Califor- 
nia, on account of the blockade where 
the snow sheds had burned. Finally 
he reached Reno, then Carson City, 
then Ogden, Utah, where he entered 
the Pullman Service, running on the 
narrow gauge from Ogden to Poca-

When the Indian reservation was 
thrown open to the public in Idaho, 
he invested in twenty lots in Pocatello 
paying $20 a lot and a few years later 
sold them at a handsome profit and 
returned to cast his lot in Chicago.

South Carolina Negro Common Schools 


? the September and December, 
1926, and May, 1927, numbers of 
THE Crisis, we published reports on 
the Negro common schools of Geor- 
gia, Mississippi and North Carolina. 
The investigation upon which these 
reports were based was paid for by a 
Five Thousand Dollar appropriation 
from the American Fund for Public 
Service. The present report is con- 
densed because of the lack of money 
for extended publication, but we trust 
it will be informing. 


SOUTH CAROLINA 

HE South Carolina public school 

system is notable for its deliber- 
ate and continued discrimination 
against Negro schools. ‘There is no 
semblance of an attempt to give the 
Negro citizen a real public school sys- 
tem, or one that remotely approaches 
the system in vogue for the whites. 
The discrimination which has always 
been pronounced, is growing and not 
a single voice in the state has been 
raised against it. A few white lead- 
ers of South Carolina have pleaded 
for imprevement in the condit:ons of 
the Negro public schools on the ground 
that present conditions are merely 
wasteful. But even these voices have 
been apologetic rather than condem- 
natory. 


South Carolina during the 18th 
Century forbade the teaching of slaves 
to read and write and forbade free 
Negroes to do any teaching at all. 
During the Civil War large numbers 
of refugees congregated at Port Royal 
and on the Sea Islands and systematic 
teaching began. During the early ef- 
forts at reconstruction every effort was 
made to reduce the Negroes to slavery 
again and to stop their schools. Negro 
Suffrage in South Carolina meant the 
first definite establishment of a public 
school system for Negroes and whites 
and is perhaps the greatest gift of 
the Negro to South Carolina. The 
Constitution of 1868 provided for free 
school regardless of race or color. But 
schools were not actually opened until 
1872 and then were partially closed 
again in the political revolution of 
1876. By the laws of 1877 the con- 
trol of the schools was placed in the 
hands of local elective officials and thus 
the system has continued until our 
day. 


HE Negroes have long formed a 

majority of the population of 
South Carolina, although that major- 
ity has been dwindling. In 1900, for 
instance, there were 557,807 whites 
and 782,321 Negroes. By 1920, there 
were 818,538 white, and 864,719 Ne-

groes. The number of Negroes en- 
rolled in the public schools is as fol- 
lows:

The cost of the Negro schools was 
$203,033 in 1900 and in 1925, a quar- 
ter of a century later, this had increased 
to $1,800,150. On the other hand, the 
cost of the white schools was $693,807 
in 1900 and in 1925 was $11,561,819. 
In other words, South Carolina spent 
over three times as much on her white 
schools as on her Negro schools at the 
beginning of the century and at the 
end of the first quarter of the century, 
she was spending over six times as 
much. And during all this time there 
were more Negroes to be educated 
than whites. All this is the deliberate 
action of the whites, as W. K. Tate, 
State Supervisor of Elementary Rural 


Schools said in 1912: 


“The education of the Negro in 
South Carolina is in the hands of the 
white race. The white trustees ap- 
portion the funds, select the teachers 
and receive the reports. The county 
superintendent has the supervision of 
these schools in his hands. We have 
expended this year $349,834.60 in the 
support of Negro schools. I never

schools and only $1,655,652 for Negro schools! 


visit one of these schools without feel- 
ing that we are wasting a large part 
of this money and are neglecting a 
great opportunity. The Negro school 
houses are miserable beyond all de- 
scription. They are usually without 
comfort, equipment, proper lighting, 
or sanitation. Nearly all the Negroes 
of school age in the district are 
crowded into these miserable struc- 
tures during the short term which the 
school runs. Most of the teachers are 
absolutely untrained and have been 
given certificates by the county board 
not because they have passed the ex- 
amination, but because it is necessary 
to have some kind of a Negro teacher.” 


N 1922, the state published a series 

of graphs showing the comparative 
situation of Negro and white schools 
that year. We reproduce some of these. 
(Page 331). So wretched was the con- 
dition of South Carolina Negro 
schools that in the last ten years vari- 
ous outside philanthropic bodies have 
tried to help. The General Education 
Board has paid for a white State Agent 
for colored schools. The Rosenwald 
Fund has built school houses, aided 
by contributions from the colored peo- 
ple, white people and the educational 
authorities. The Jeanes Fund has paid 
for teachers. These contributions have 
varied from $82,694 in 1922 to $92,- 
514 in 1925. This has had compara- 
tively little effect upon the state. The 
State Agent for colored schools says 
in 1925: “The organization and de- 
velopment of these schools in any com- 
munity depend absolutely upon the 
education and standard of: the white 
folk”. The local (white) Board of 
Trustees in each district uses in its 
discretion whatever school funds are 
expended for colored schools. Thus, 
the total amount of state aid for vari- 
ous counties was in 1922, $1,851,715. 
Of this every cent went to white 
schools except $15,000. In the case 
of school houses outside aid brought 
better results: From July Ist, 1920 to 
June 30, 1922, they erected 89 school 
houses at a cost of $424,874. Not- 
withstanding this, in the latter year 
the State Agent says: “Only about 
10 per cent of the colored school houses 
in the state are respectable’. Other 
facts for 1922 are as follows:

INALLY, the Superintendent of 
Education, J. E. Swearin, ap- 
pends this joyful word to page 31 of 
his report for 1922: ‘“‘The Negro can 
now secure anything in South Carolina 
except social and political equality’. 
It is a little difficult to get the latest 
reports of South Carolina schools, so 
that conditions today must be illus- 


trated mainly by figures from the year 
1924-25:

The State Agent says that 90 per 
cent of the schools in 1924-5 “are still 
being accommodated and are attempted 
to be taught under very undesirable 
conditions”. 


The Legislature which adjourned in 
April, 1927, appropriated $3,250,000 
instead of the $3,512,000 which the 
Superintendent of Education asked. 
There was also a deficit of $473,000 
in 1926. This means that the colored 
schools will undoubtedly suffer most. 


There is only one bright spot in 
the South Carolina school situation 
and that is the building of the Rosen- 
wald school-houses, 

There have been completed to date 
(November, 1927) in South Carolina, 
381 Negro school houses paid for as 
follows:

HESE school houses house 57,105 
pupils or 34 per cent of the rural 
Negro school population. 

Excellent as this showing is and 
great as is the debt of South Carolina 
and the Negro to Julius Rosenwald, 
it has two unfortunate features. 

First, nothing could be more aston- 
ishing than to see a proud Southern 
commonwealth, which in the past pro- 
tested loudly against the “interfer- 
ence” of philanthropists with its in- 
stitutions, now on its knees before the 
organized philanthropy of the North 
for contributions toward the support 
of its public school system; and espe- 
cially that part of the system which is 
chiefly necessary to increase the eff- 
ciency of labor and decrease the waste 
of crime, sickness and poverty. Sec- 
ond, we must not forget the injustice 
of the double taxation forced on Ne-

groes to support their schools. The 
brunt of public taxation on real prop- 
erty, land and business falls heavily 
and chiefly, in the last analysis, on the 
black laborers. Yet from these school 
funds the whites get their school houses 
built for them while the Negro in his 
poverty must submit to $400,000 ad-

ditional taxation to get his school 
houses. This may teach sacrifice but 
it is terribly unjust. 


HIS gives a general picture of the 
Negro schools. To this may be 
added a word on local conditions. 
Charleston is the metropolis of the 
state. It had in 1920, 35,585 whites 
and 32,326 Negroes in the city, while 
in the county, including the city, there 
were 44,214 whites and 64,236 Ne- 
groes. Of this population 14,178 are

reported to be illiterate or 5,000 more 
than in any other county of the state; 
and, of course, the real facts are far 
in excess of this report. Charleston 
Negroes have always had an intelli- 
gent, striving group of educated lead- 
ers. The free Negroes supported their 
own schools for ten years, beginning 
in 1744 until the state law stopped 
them. In 1822, they attempted under 
Denmark Vesey, one of the most care- 
fully planned insurrections against 
slavery made in the United States. On 
the other hand, they have received from 
their white fellow citizens a minimum 
of encouragement. The present con- 
ditions of their schools can be seen from 
the following figures:

N Charleston there are four schools. 

In the Simmonton School, which is 
in a low street which is easily flooded 
when it rains, there are five grades with 
1,150 pupils; 27 teachers who receive 
from $50 to $62.50 a month. The 
term is nine months. The Buist School 
is in a good location and has 5 grades 
and an enrollment of 905 with 14 
teachers. There are double sessions; 
that is, two sessions a day for the First 
and Second Grades. The Principal 
personally has furnished the piano 
which is used in the school. The 
Shaw School is a frame building heated 
by stoves and has 5 grades and an en- 
rollment of 890; there are 18 teachers 
for a 9 month school. The Burke In- 
dustrial School was built in 1910 near 
a dumping ground. It has from the 
5th to 11th grade and an enrollment 
of nearly 1,000 under 24 teachers. 
This is supposed to be the high school, 
but the real high school for the city 
is a private school, Avery Institute. 


The plight of Avery Institute illus- 
trates the school methods of South 
Carolina. It was established by the 
American Missionary Association and 
the Association still pays about one- 
third of its $16,000 annual budget. 
Avery has 500 pupils of whom 200 are 
in high school and it employes 11 
teachers. It has for years done all of 
the normal work and practically all 
of the high school work for the city. 
Nearly all the teachers in the city 


331 








schools are graduates of Avery, yet 
the city, the county and the state have 
refused any aid to the school. In the 
last four years colored people have 
raised more than $9,000 and in 1927, 
they attempted to raise $3,500; but 
the unfavorable industrial conditions 
and the failure of two banks prevented 
them. The school is literally starv- 
ing for support. 

For the year 1926-27 Charleston 
made the following appropriations for 
its white and Negro schools:

N Columbia there is a 9 months’ 

term and 4 schools. The Booker T. 
Washington School has 11 grades and 
2 buildings. The buildings were put 
on land which was cheap but has 
proved expensive because it had to be 
buttressed. There is an enrollment 
of 1,286 pupils under 28 teachers. The 
salaries range from $60 to $90 a 
month. Five of the grades have dou- 
ble sessions and about 100 beginners 
were turned away at the opening of 
school. ~The old Howard School is 
a very old wooden building across 
from the jail and in a bad situation. 
't has 840 pupils in 7 grades under 16 
teachers. The salaries are from $55 
to $80 a month and there are double 
sessions in First Grade. The new 
Howard School is in a new brick build- 
ing near a railroad on a dumping 
ground. It has 415 pupils in 7 grades, 
under 12 teachers. There are double 
sessions in the First Grade. 

The salaries for white teachers in 
the grade schools begin at $900 and 
reach $1,400. In the high schools the 
salaries begin with $1,000 and go to 
$2,000. In the Negro graded schools 
the salaries range from $550 to $800 
and in the high school from $600 to 
$850. 


HE white schools have ample space 

for their children with 40 or 
fewer pupils to a teacher in a class- 
room. But the Superintendent says: 
“The same contention can not be 
made for the Negro schools. Up to 
September, 1924, we had been com- 
pelled to take care of from 200 to 300 
more Negro pupils than the two school 
buildings were equipped to accommo- 
date. At that time we opened the 
third building, a new one, equipped 
to accommodate 450 pupils. We had 
such an inrush of new pupils that 
within two weeks after the opening 
of school, we had as many overcrowded 
rooms as ever. We are still com- 
pelled to run double daily sessions of 
pupils in several grades at two of the 


332 


schools. One teacher in these cases 
meets two groups of pupils each day. 
The fourth year has been added to the 
Negro high school, and practically the 
entire third year class remained to en- 
ter the fourth year. 

“Tt is but justice to say that our 
Negro teachers, almost without excep- 
tion, have been patient, faithful and 
loyal throughout these years of 
crowded conditions.” 

This is the result of outrageous dis- 
crimination on the part of the city in 
the use of public taxes. By bond is- 
sues in 1922-25 they raised $375,000, 
which with other items made a total 
building fund of $438,645. Of this 
the Negroes, forming 47 per cent of 
the county population, received only 
$73,304, or 16 per cent. 


HERE are similar conditions in 

Greenville, where two of the 
three schools are in old frame build- 
ings. The third school is a new brick 
school, but in a poor situation. “There 
are no colored men in this school sys- 
tem as the Superintendent is unfavor- 
able to them.” He defers entirely to 
the reactionary poor whites. A private 
school, housed in dilapidated frame 
buildings, does most of the high school 
work. In Orangeburg, the public 
school is terribly overcrowded, with 
as many as 100 in some classes and 
3 in a seat. Nine miles from Orange- 
burg is a new Rosenwald School with 
a Teachers’ Home. Here conditions 
are much better, but the state pays for 
only six months’ school, and gives the 
teachers from $50 to $55 a month, ex- 
cept the Principal who receives a sal- 
ary from the Smith-Hughes Fund. In 
Sumpter, there is one old and one new 
school. Both have double sessions 
through the 5th Grade and are very 
much crowded. In many counties for 
1927 the Board of Education has cut 
the Negro schools from 5 to 3 months, 
even when paying salaries as little as 
$42.50 a month. In Bennettsville, in 
1926, we find a colored minister, pray- 
ing to white people for a decent 
school building because visitors “look 
with laughter and indignation at what 
we cail our school”. And finally, per- 
haps this picture will do for rural 
South Carolina. It is written from 
Seabrook in Beaufort County in 
March, 1927: 


66 HE school children are poorly 

provided for, having to walk 
long distances to school, an average of 
2 to + miles a day. School term 6 
months, November to May. The aver- 
age person 18 to 45 do not know the 
alphabet. School houses small, over- 
crowded. A number of children don’t 
get any lessons for 2 or 3 days. Some 
parents get disheartened and keep their 
children away from school.” 


Finally it may round out the pic- 
ture to remember that South Carolina 
has lynched 134 Negroes in the last 
38 years and is, next to Louisiana, the 
most illiterate state in the Union.

I believe in brownies too. 
Yes, I believe in fairies

And if you'll learn to love them, 
They'll come to play with you. 


When Ma Goes Out

HEN Ma goes out, we kids “dress

Pretend we're “grown-ups” then. 
Joe gets big brother’s “Sunday vest”, 
May wears Ma’s dress for “very best”, 
I, sister’s brand new slippers test, 
When Ma goes out. 
We always have a lot of fun 
With Pa’s old broken gun. 
We walk, and strut, and toss our heads— 
Our hands in gloves, tho’ feet in “Keds’”— 
We dream of castles, not of sheds, 
When Ma goes out.

The daisy blue and sweet red rose 
Perhaps she’ll find are just the thing, 
When March has swept away the snows, 
In which to dress herself next spring.

THE N.AAC? BATTLE PROE § 


| 
—¥. 
~ Se rea 





HE essential fight of the Negro 
| for recognition in America, de- 
pends in great part upon the 
public sentiment which can be created 
in favor of according the full oppor- 
tunity which is every American citi- 
zen’s due. Of late years, the best 
spokesmen in behalf of the Negro’s 
cause, have been Negro writers, poets, 
novelists and dramatists, scientists, 
teachers, actors and singers and the 
many colored people who by the ex- 
ample of their lives have demonstrated 
their race’s case beyond any refutation. 
Accompanying these individual dem- 
onstrations, is the campaign incessantly 
conducted by the National Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People in the various channels that 
reach the white reading public. Chief 
among these channels are of course 
the daily newspapers of large circula- 
tion, that reach every stratum of the 
American people. 
The N. A. A. C. P. publicity de- 
partment sends out upwards of 500 
press releases every year, of which 


most go to the colored editors and ap-: 


proximately sixty go to the white edi- 
tors. It may be interesting to exam- 
ine just what the effect on the white 
press of these press releases is during 
a single month, so far as we have been 
able to obtain records of them. We 
shall take the month of October, 1927, 
as a specimen. 

In that month, the N. A. A. C. P. 
had occasion to send out a story at- 
tributing the student strike in Gary, 
Indiana, designed to oust colored stu- 
dents from the Emerson High School, 
to Ku Klux Klan propaganda. This 
release was sent to white editors and 
according to latest reports was pub- 
lished in the following newspapers, 
whose circulation figures according to 
Ayer’s Annual for 1925 (many of 
them considerably increased since then) 
are as follows:

It will be seen from this tabulation 
that the N. A. A. C. P. release was 


published not only throughout the 
United States, in every section of the 
country, but that it reached one of the 
most important newspapers of Europe, 
the London Times, and was thereby 
carried to all parts of the world. The 
/circulation of 2,275,084 shown for 
this single release of the N. A. A. C. 
P. is far below the actual circulation 
achieved. In the first place, the tabu- 
lation depends upon clippings fur- 
nished us by a clipping agency; and 
such an agency sends in only a frac- 
tion of the stories published through- 
out the country. Moreover, the cir- 
culation of many of the papers, prob- 
ably most of them, listed in Ayer’s 
Annual, has increased since 1925. A 
conservative estimate would raise the 
circulation of this story to at least five 
million readers. 

Let us take another release sent out 
in the same month. It concerns a 
murder case in New Jersey, in which 
Negroes were falsely accused of hav- 
ing committed a crime. Someone took 
upon himself to offer by telegram, in 
the name of the N. A. A. C. P., a re- 
ward of $2,000 for information lead- 
ing to the apprehension of those guilty 
of the crime unjustly charged to col- 
ored men. While the N. A. A. C. P. 
sympathized with the point of view 
expressed in the telegram, it could not 
be responsible for a reward of $2,000 
offered from its funds by an unknown 


ae EES = om oe *. 


person. So a denial of the authenti- 
city of the reward was issued in be- 
half of the Association. Leaving aside 
the unsought publicity _— received 
through the. reward offer, which prob- 
ably ran into several millions, the 
N. A. A. C. P. denial was published, 
at latest reports, in the following pa- 
pers:

In this same month, two letters were 
sent to newspaper editors and were 
widely published on editorial pages of 
leading newspapers. One of the let- 
ters concerned the failure to punish 
the lynchers of the Lowmans in Aiken, 
South Carolina, and the other letter 
called attention to the breakdown of 
law and orderly government incident 
to Klan domination in Indiana and 
Alabama. The two letters, according 
to clippings received, were published 
as follows:

To these figures must be added the 
circulation of 60,478 of the Washing- 
ton Post, which reprinted part of the 
N. A. A. C. P. release to colored edi- 
tors concerning the fight against segre- 
gation of the building of the Depart- 
ment of the Interior of that city. The 
total circulation attained by two let- 
ters to editors and three releases sent 
out by the N. A. A. C. P. in a period 


of one month, on the basis of clippings

returned to the National Office is 
5,501,656, a formidable figure, yet only 
a fraction of the actual circulation. 
It is safe to say that the actual cir- 
culation is at the very least double 
that indicated by these figures. 

This circulation in the American 
and foreign press serving white read- 
ers shows two things about the pub- 
licity of the Association. First, that its 
reputation for accuracy is such, that 
the Associated Press and other news- 
distributing agencies, accept and trans- 
mit without further question the in- 
formation sent out from the National 
Office. This confidence in the N. A. 
A. C. P. releases has been established 
over a period of years during which 
only once has the Association had to 
send out a correction of any news 
story. Second, the circulation shows 
not only that information about race 
relations is news, but that the releases 
of the Association are news in the 
opinion of the agencies which distri- 
bute it and the newspapers which pub- 
lish it. 

It is perhaps needless to inform 
those familiar with the Association’s 
publicity work that this appeal to white 
readers through daily newspapers is 
only one phase of the Association’s 
work. Most members of the Asso- 
ciation know that each week about 240 
colored editors in all parts of the 
United States receive a summary of 
N. A. A. C. P. activities for the week 
and such other general information on 
race relations in all parts of the world 
as there is space for; and that mem- 
bers of the Executive Staff are fre- 
quent contributors not only to leading 
monthly magazines and weeklies but 
also to more lasting compilations. The 
chapter on mob violence and lynching 
in the American Year Book having 
been written for the past three years 
by a member of the Executive Staff of 
the Association. Moreover, the Asso- 
ciation’s Annual Report and pamphlet 
publications have a wide circulation 
among libraries, newspapers and inter- 
ested individuals. 

The cumulative effect of this work,

with its aggregate of circulation reach- 
ing probably into the hundreds of mil- 
lions, is slow. But that it is playing 
its part in the change in public senti- 
ment on race relations, stimulating 
freer discussion, subjecting opinions 
and facts to sharper and sharper scru- 
tiny, there can be no doubt. An ex- 
ample is the old “usual crime” talk 
in connection with lynching. That 
bogy is about dead. The apology of 
the “usual crime” has been killed by 
facts obtained by N. A. A. C. P. in- 
vestigators and published to the world 
by the N. A. A. C. P. And only the 
most ignorant of benighted rural edi- 
tors in the South now presume even 
to allude to it. And if further evi- 
dence were needed of the change in 
American public sentiment on race re- 
lations, there need only be cited the 
frequency with which newspaper edi- 
tors publish news releases and letters 
setting forth in most uncompromising 
fashion the fundamental position upon 
which the N. A. A. C. P. and its work 
are based: equality of opportunity and 
human treatment for all men irrespec- 
tive of race or color. 


1.2 é 


DOWNING JIM CROW 


An excellent object lesson in the 
value of a persistent and public cam- 
paign against discrimination is fur- 
nished by the clear-cut victory won 
by the Washington, D. C., Branch un- 
der the leadership of its President, Mr. 
Neval H. Thomas, against segregation 
in the Department of the Interior in 
Washington. In this department, col- 
ored clerks had been set aside by them- 
selves. They had been deprived of the 
services of white stenographers, being 
obliged to submit matter to them in 
writing instead of dictating it in per- 
son. And this procedure, Mr. Hubert 
Work, Secretary of the Interior, had 
the face to announce was adopted to 
promote “efficiency” in the Depart- 
ment. 


A campaign was begun against this 
segregation, and it was pointed out 


Miss C. Evans

St. Louis, Mo. 


Mrs. M. Towler 
3rd prise 

Long Branch, N. J. 
also that colored clerks had not been 
promoted to fill the higher positions 
of examiners in the Pension Bureau. 
The campaign involved several per- 
sonal calls on Mr. Work and an inter- 
change of letters. In one of his let- 
ters, replying to Secretary Work’s 
complaint against “meddling” by “out- 
siders”’ Mr. Thomas clearly pointed 
out that he was a taxpayer to the 
United States government and there- 
fore no outsider to the administration 
of a public department; moreover, that 
he represented a national organization, 
the N. A. A. C. P., whose business it 
was, in behalf of American principles, 
to protest against discrimination, segre- 
gation and other un-American prac- 
tices. 

The publicity department was asked 
to assist in the fight and assistance was 
given. Stories were sent out to the 
colored press of the entire nation, set- 
ting forth Mr. Work’s excuses, the 
spirited protests being made not only 
in behalf of the colored clerks but by 
the colored clerks themselves, thirty- 
six out of the forty-two clerks signing 
a written protest against Mr. Work’s 
“efficiency” measures. 

The campaign eventually bore fruit. 
Two clerks were promoted to the of- 
fice of examiner. All the clerks were 
restored to the places they had occu- 
pied before segregation went into ef- 
fect. And Mr. Work in a belated 
statement announced that he had not 
intended any segregation in the first 
place and far be it from him to spon- 
sor any such discrimination as had 
been charged to him. 

There were those, among them 
Washington newspaper correspondents, 
who were unkind enough to say that 
Mr. Work’s interest in the Presiden- 
tial candidacy of Mr. Herbert Hoover 
and the distasteful publicity given the 
segregation in the Interior Depart- 
ment, had something to do with the 
abrupt termination of the segregation 
there. In any case, a persistent, re- 
iterated and widely published demand, 
that segregation in the Interior De- 
partment cease, (Turn to page 352)

at nine o'clock, he had been the first 
one in. His heart was beating fast. 
His heart beat faster than it should. 
No heart should beat so fast that you 
choke at the throat when you try to 
breathe. You should not feel it knock- 
ing — knocking — knocking — now 
against your ribs, now against some- 
thing deep within you. Knocking 
against something deep, so deep that 
you cannot fall asleep without feeling 
a cutting, pressing weight laid against 
your throat, over your chest. A cut- 
ting, pressing weight that makes you 
struggle to spring from the midst of 
your sleep. Spring up. 

It had beat like that now for months. 
At first he had tried to work it off. 
Swung the pick in his daily ditch dig- 
ging—faster—harder. But that had 
not helped it at all. It had beaten 
harder and faster for the swinging. 
He had tried castor-oil to run it off of 
his system. Someone told him he ate 
too much meat and smoked too much. 
So he had given up his beloved ham 
and beef and chicken and tried to 
swing the pick on lighter things. 

It would be better soon. 

His breath had began to get short 
then.. He had to stop oftener to rest 
between swings. ‘The foreman, Mike 
Leary, had cursed at first and then 
moved him back to the last line of dig- 
gers. It hurt him to think he was 
not so strong as he had been.—But it 
would be better soon. 


E would not tell his wife how 

badly his heart knocked. It 
would be better soon. ‘He could not 
afford to lay off from work. He had 
to dig. Nobody is able to lay off work 
when there is a woman and children 
to feed and cover. 

The castor oil had not helped. The 
meat had been given up, even his little 
pleasure in smoking. Still the heart 
beat too fast. Still the heart beat so 
he felt it up in the chords on each 
side of his neck below his ears.—But 
it would be better soon. 

It would be better. He had asked 
to be let off half a day so he could 
be at the hospital at ten o’clock. Mike 
had growled his usual curses when 
he asked to get off. 

“What the hell is wrong wit’ you? 
All you need is a good dose of whis- 
key!” 


He had gone off. When the doors 
of the Out-Patient’s Department 
opened, he was there. It took him a 
long time to get up the stairs. The 
knocking was in his throat so. Beads 
of perspiration stood grey on his black- 
brown forehead. He closed his eyes 
a moment and leaned his head back. 


A sound of crying made him open 
them. On the seat beside a woman 
held a baby in her arms. The baby 
was screaming itself red in the face, 
wriggling and twisting to get out of 
its mother’s arms on the side where 
the man sat. The mother shifted the 
child from one side to the other and 
told him with her eyes, “You ought not 
to be here!” 


E had tried to smile over the 

knocking at the baby. Now he 
rolled his hat over in his hands and 
looked down. 

When he looked up, he turned his 
eyes away from the baby and _ its 
mother. The knocking peunded. Why 
should a little thing like that make his 
heart pound. He must be badly off 
to breathe so fast over nothing. The 
thought made his heart skip and pound 
the harder. 


But he would be better soon. 


Other patients began to file in. Soon 
the nurse at the desk began to read 
names aloud. He had put his card 
in first but she did not call him first. 
As she called each name, a patient 
stood up and went through some 
swinging doors. 

Green lights—men in white coats 
—nurses in white caps and dresses 
filled the room it would seem, from the 
glimpses caught through the door. It 
seemed quiet and still, too, as if every- 
one were listening to hear something. 


Once the door swung open wildly 
and an Italian came dashing madly 
through—a doctor close behind him. 
The man threw himself on a bench: 
“Oh God! Oh God! I ain’t that 
sick, I ain’t so sick I gotta die! No! 
You don’t really know. I ain’t so 
sick!” 

The doctor leaned over him and 
said something quietly. The nurse 
brought something cloudy in a glass. 
The man drank it. By and by he was 
led out—hiccuping but quieter. 


ACK in his corner, his heart beat 
smotheringly. Suppose that had 
been he? Sick enough to die! Was 
the dago crazy, trving to run away? 
Run as he would, the sickness would

be always with him. For himself, he 
would be better soon. 

“Peter Jackson! Peter Jackson. 
Peter Jackson. Five, Sawyer Avenue!” 
The nurse had to say it twice before 
he heard through his thoughts. 

Thump. The beat of his heart 
knocked him to his feet. He had to 
stand still before he could move. 

“Here! This way.” The nurse 
said it so loudly—so harshly—that the 
entire room turned around to look at 
him. 

She need not be so

nurse pushed open the door and pressed 
it back. “Dr. Sibley?” she called. 

The door swung shut behind him. 
Along each side of the room were 
desks. Behind each, sat a doctor. 
When the nurse called “Dr. Sibley”, 
no one answered, so Jackson stood at 
the door. His heart rubbed his ribs 
unnecessarily. 

“Say! Over here!” 

The words and the voice made his 
heart race again.—But he would be 
better now. He turned toward the 
direction of the voice, met a cool pair 
of blue eyes boring through tortoise- 
rimmed glasses. He sat down. 

‘he doctor took a sheet of paper. 
“What’s your name?” 


IS heart had been going so that 
when he said “Peter Jackson’, 
he could make no sound the first time. 

‘“‘What’s your name, I said.” 

“Peter Jackson.” 

“How old are you?” 

“Fifty-four.” 

“Occupation ? 
work?” 

“Day laborer for the city.” 

“Can you afford to pay a doctor?” 

Surprise took the rest of his breath 
away for a second. The question had 
to be repeated. 

“T guess so. I never been sick.” 

“Well, if you can afford to pay a 
doctor, you ought not to come here. 
This clinic is for foreigners and people 
who cannot pay a doctor. Your people 
have some of your own doctors in this 
city.” 

The doctor wrote for such a long 
time on the paper then that he thought 
he was through with him and he 
started to get up. 

“Sit down.” The words caught him 
before he was on his feet. “I haven't 
told you to go anywhere.” 

“TI thought—,” Jackson hung on 
his words uncertain. 

“You needn’t! Don’t think! Open 
your shirt.” And the doctor fitted a 
pair of tubes in his ears and shut out 
his thoughts. 


336 


Where do you 





E fitted the tubes in his ears and 
laid a sieve-like piece of rubber 
against his patient’s chest. Laid it up. 
Laid it down. Finally he said: “What 


have you been doing to this heart of 


yours? All to pieces. All gone.” 
Gone. His heart was all gone. He 


tried to say something but the doctor 
snatched the tube away and turned 
around to the desk and wrote again. 

Again he turned around: “Push up 
your sleeve,” he said this time. 

The sleeve went up. A piece of 
rubber went around his arm above the 
elbow. Something began to squeeze 
—knot—drag on his arm. 

“Pressure almost two hundred,” the 
doctor shot at him this time. “You 
can't stand this much longer.” 

He turned around. He wrote again. 
He wrote and pushed the paper away. 
“Well,” said the doctor, “you will 
have to stop working and lie down. 
You must keep your feet on a level 
vith your body.” 

Jackson wanted to yell with laugh- 
ter. Lie down. If he had had breath 
enough, he would have blown all the 
papers off the desk, he would have 
laughed so. He looked into the blue 
eyes. “I can’t stop work,” he said. 

The doctor shrugged: ‘Then,’ he 
said, and said no more. 

Then! Then what? 

Neither one of them spoke. 

Then what? 

Jackson wet his lips: “You mean 
—you mean | got to stop work to get 
well ?” 

“IT mean you have to stop if you 
want to stay here.” 

“You mean even if I stop you may 
not cure me?” 


HE blue eyes did go down toward 
the desk then. The answer was 
a question, 

“You don’t think I can make a new 
heart, do you? You only get one 
heart. You are born with that. You 
ought not to live so hard.” 

Live hard? Did this man think he 
had been a sport? Live hard. Liquor, 
wild sleepless nights—sleep-drugged, 
rag-worn, half-shoddy days? That in- 
stead of what it had been. Ditches 
and picks. -Births and_ funerals. 
Stretching a dollar the length of ten.

wife to feed; bread thirteen cents a

“T ain’t lived hard! I ain’t lived 
hard!” he said suddenly. “I have 
worked harder than I should, that’s 
al}.” 

“Why didn’t you get another job?” 
the doctor snapped. “Didn’t need to 
dig ditches all your life.” 






ACKSON drew himself up; “I had 

to dig ditches because I am an 
ignorant black man. If I was an 
ignorant white man, I could get easier 
jobs. I could even have worked in 
this hospital.” 

Color flooded the doector’s face. 
Whistles blew and shrieked suddenly 
outside.

looking for him. 

He started for the door. Carefully. 
He must not waste his strength. Rent, 
food, clothes. He could not afford to 
lay off. 

He had almost reached the door 
when a hand shook him suddenly. It 
was the doctor close behind him. He 
held out a white sheet of paper: “Your 
prescription,” he explained, and seemed 
to hesitate. “Digitalis. It will help 
some. I am sorry.” 

Sorry for what? Jackson found the 
side-walk and lit his pipe to steady 
himself. He had almost reached the 
ditches when he remembered the pa- 
per. He could not find it. He went

THE SECOND PORTRAIT 
Y twelve o'clock, noon, the wash- 
room of Kale’s Fine Family Laun- 
dry held enough steam to take the shell 
off of a turtle’s back. Fill tubs with 
steaming water at six o'clock, set thirty 
colored women to rubbing and shout- 
ing and singing at the tubs and by 
twelve o'clock noon the room is over 
full of steam. The steam is thick— 
warm—and it settles on your flesh like 
a damp fur rug. Every pore sits agape 
in your body; agape—dripping. 

Kale’s Fine Family Laundry did a 
good business. Mr. Kale believed in 
this running on oiled cogs. Cogs that 
slip easily—oiled from the lowest to 
the highest. 

Now the cogs lowest in his smooth 
machinery were these thirty tubs and 
the thirty women at the tubs. I put 
the tubs first, because they were al- 
ways there. The women came and 
went. Sometimes they merely went. 
Most all of them were dark brown 
and were that soft bulgy fat that no 
amount of hard work can rub off of 
some colored women. All day long 
they rubbed and scrubbed and sang or 
shouted and cursed or were silent ac- 
cording to their thirty natures. 

Madie Frye never sang or shouted 
or cursed aloud. Madie was silent. 
She sang and shouted and cursed with- 
in. She sang the first day she came 
there to work. Sang songs of thanks- 
giving within her. She had needed

months until she came there. She had

FIRST PRIZE POEMS 
By MAE V. COWDERY 
Longings 
O dance— 
In the light of moon, 

A platinum moon 
Poised like a slender dagger 
On the velvet darkness 
of night. 


To dream— 

*’Neath the bamboo trees 
On the sable breast 

Of earth— 

And listen to the wind. 


To croon— 

Weird sweet melodies 
Round the cabin door 

With banjos clinking softly— 
And from out the shadow 
Hear the beat of tom-toms 
Resonant through the years. 


To plunge— 

My brown body 

In a golden pool, 

And lazily float on the swell 
Watching the rising sun. 


To stand— 

On a purple mountain 
Hidden from earth 
By mists of dreams 
And tears— 


To talk— 
With God. 


Lamps 


ODIES are lamps 

And their life is the light. 
Ivory, Gold, Bronze and Ebony— 
Yet all are lamps 
And their lives the lights. 


Dwelling in the tabernacles 
Of the most high—are lamps. 
Lighting the weary pilgrims’ way 
As they travel the dreary night—are 
lamps. 
Swinging aloft in great Cathedrals 
Beaming on rich and poor alike—are 
lamps. 
Flickering fitfully in harlot dives 
Wanton as they that dwell therein— 
are lamps. 
Ivory, Gold, Bronze and Ebony— 
Yet all are lamps 
And their lives the lights. 


Some flames rise high above the horizon 
And urge others to greater power. 
Some burn steadfast thru the night 
To welcome the prodigal home. 
Others flicker weakly, lacking oil to burn 
And slowly die unnoticed. 


December, 1927 





PRIZE POEMS, KRIGWA, 1927 


What matter how bright the flame 
How weak? 

What matter how high it blazes 
How low? 

A puff of wind will put it out. 


You and I are lamps—Ebony lamps, 
Our flame glows red and rages high 
within 
But our ebon shroud becomes a shadow 
And our light seems weak and low. 
Break that shadow 
And let the flame illumine heaven 
Or blow wind... . blow 
And let our feeble lights go out. 





SECOND PRIZE POEM 


Song to a Dark Gir! 
By EDWARD SILVERA 
OUR eyes are bold 
Like all the stars 

That blaze in jungle skies. 

Your lips are sweet 

Like jungle fruit 

That no one sells or buys. 


Your breast is warm 

Like tropic noons, 

Like noons of jungle days. 
Your voice sounds strange 
Like all the winds 

That sing wild jungle lays. 


In your embrace 
There’s strength and joy 
And God has given thee 
A flame to fire 

Thy soul and burn 
Within incessantly.

THIRD PRIZE POEM 
ee er 
By ETHEL M. CAUTION 
UT of the hush of night, 
Out of the sob of morn, 


(@ut of the sigh of noon, 
Thy soul was born. 


Part of the gentle tears 
That dim fair April’s eyes, 
Part of the gladsome smiles 
That warm her skies; 


Grace of the violet shy, 
Fragrance of new-born rose, 
Beauty of every flower 
That woodland grows; 


Softness of mild May winds, 
Sweetness of days in June; 
Lilt from a melody 

Of heavenly tune; 


Out of the ages past, 
Out of the years to be; 
Out of his vast unknown 
God fashioned thee. 





HONORABLE MENTION 
My Wish 

By MARGUERITE A. LOWE 

rather have the thought of you to 
hold against my heart, 

Than any gift that mortal hands have 
power to impart. 

I'd rather have the dream of you to keep 
within my breast, 

Than any shining dower of gold by for- 
tune’s few possessed. 

Ah, love, no sweeter thing than this I’d 
ask to come to me, 

That I might keep the thought of you 
through all eternity. 


Twilight Fancy 
By GEORGE L. ALLEN 
[) USK came dancing down the dale 
I 


vike a slim dark maiden, 
Crowned with blossoms sunset-pale, 
Dream-perfumed, dew-laden. 


Black as midnight were her eyes, 
Crinkly-dark her tresses, 

Sunbeams, flickering from the skies 
Wooed her with caresses. 


Lingering but an instant’s space, 
All my heart entrancing, 

Swift and sweet, her warm embrace 
Stirred my blood to dancing. 


But when Night, in splendor rare, 
Set her love-lamps gleaming, 
Dusk had fled, and left me there 


Lone, and lorn, and dreaming.

ARY WHITE OVINGTON’S 

“Portraits in Color’, (The Vik- 
ing Press), is an attempt to present 
living portraits of typical American 
Negroes in the 20th Century. She 
has not attempted to exhaust the field, 
but has picked twenty persons, six- 
teen men and four women who por- 
tray the various lines of thought and 
endeavor and the various attitudes and 
reactions characteristic of this era in 
the Negroes’ modern development. It 
is an honest and moving piece cf work, 
painted neither with sugar nor salt, 
opinionated and definite, but always 
frank and clear. 

One gets after reading a chapter of 
ten or fifteen pages a definite and un- 
derstandable impression. It may, it 
usually does, leave much to the imag- 
ination. It is by no means a refer- 
ence book with dates and names and 
places; but it is something to be read 
and thought over, disagreed with now 
and then, applauded much, and cap- 
able of a rousing in the stranger, or 
one to the problem born, a feeling of 
astonishment, gratification and curios- 
ity at the miraculous way in which 
human nature throughout one of the 
most difficult series of tests has reacted 
in the American scene. 

One might criticize the book in 
many ways. In its selection of sub- 
jects, there are a score of omitted 
names, difficult to reason about. One 
might criticize in the various portraits 
the selection of high lights and shades; 
but all this would be unimportant 
when compared with the splendid full- 
ness of result, the deep sense of sym- 
pathy and understanding, the human 
and artistic touch. The book must 
have meant a great deal of work and 
thought. And it is interesting and im- 
portant for young and facile authors 
to know that Miss Ovington has 
“written of no one whom I have not 
met and seen at work. The portraits 
are drawn frem life”, 

“The History of the Twenty-Fifth 
Regiment United States Infantry” 
edited by one of its Captains, J. H. 
Nankivell, is a deserving tribute to a 
celebrated organization. It contains a 
great deal of information carefully 
packed in, and most of it for that very 
reason, almost unreadable. Colored 
readers will hunt in vain for any ref- 
erence to the late Colonel Young or 
any of the colored officers who from 
time to time have served with the 
regiment. It is nevertheless an invalu- 


able work of reference.

REE, 








John J. Niles’ “Singing Soldiers’, 
(Charles Scribner’s Sons) is dedicated 
“to the American Negro soldiers who 
made this writing possible”. The au- 
thor tried to make a collection of 
United States army war songs and to 
include many songs sung by soldiers 
of the United States, ‘but the imag- 
ination of the white boys did not, as 
a rule, express themselves in song”. 
He began to lose interest in his quest 
until he encountered some Negro 
troops; not simply the _ semi-profes- 
sional musician, but “the others, the 
natural born singers, usually from 
rural districts, who, prompted by 
hunger, wounds, homesickness, and the 
reaction to so many generations of sup- 
pression, sang the legend of the black 
man to tunes and harmonies they made 
up as they went along.” Out of this 
came the book made up of Negro 
songs, of all sorts and kinds. It is 
the most interesting and impressive col- 
lection. Negro is spelt with a small 
“n” and most of the illustrations are 
but caricatures, but the book as a 
whole is finely and sympathetically 
done and worth reading and study. 

The Washington Intercollegiate 
Club of Chicago, under the editorship 
of Frederic H. Robb has published the 
“1927 Intercollegiate Wonder Book” 
with a survey of Negro educational, 
athletic, civic and commercial life. It 
represents an astonishing amount of 
work and must have meant the expen- 
diture of much money. It is arranged 
in a rather bewildering way which 
makes it difficult to use as a reference 
book, but as a picture of colored Chi- 
cago, it is about the best single volume 
that one could look at. 

Miss Kathryn M. Johnson sends 
us a little pamphlet on the biography 
of Frederick Douglass. It ought to 
be interesting to young people. 

The Vanguard Books of the Month 
include “Company Unions” by Robert 
W. Dunn, Grace S. Scribner’s “Amer- 
ican Pilgrimage’, Kropotkin’s Revo- 
lutionary Pamphlets, stories by the 
late John Reed and a reprint of some 
of Proudhon’s social philosophy. They

IN THE MAGAZINES 


E take off our hats to Dorothy 
Parker for her amusing ‘‘Ar- 
rangement in Black and White” which 
appears in the October 8 issue of the 
New Yorker. Her squib sounds word 
for word like one thousand conversa- 
tions we have overheard at parties with 
smart sprinklings of dusky celebrities. 
Inevitably there is that fair pinched- 
faced one with the benevolent eyes who 
is obviously—too obviously—unpreju- 
diced and who attempts to convince 
her audience that she believes in ‘‘ab- 
so-lute” equality in some such convinc- 
ing strain: “I haven’t the slightest 
feeling about colored people. Why 
I’m just crazy about some of them. 
Well now, listen, I have this 
colored laundress. I’ve had her for 
years and I’m devoted to her. And I 
want to tell you I think of her as my 
friend”. 

Henry Christophe, a Haitian who 
was born a slave and who died a king, 
had in all probability, the most drama- 
tic career of any Negro in the history 
of the world. John W. Vandercook 
gives us a magnificent picture of his 
“Black Majesty” in Harper’s for Oc- 
tober. Christophe, an untutored man 
of tremendous size and virility, with 
the aid of Toussaint L’Ouverture and 
Jean Jaques Dessalines, waged a fif- 
teen year war for the political free- 
dom of Haiti. After his confreres had 
ruled over Haiti and were killed, 
Christophe reigned for fourteen years 
with the iron hand of one who had 
fought his way to a coveted place. An 
account of Christophe’s life reads like 
a play—a play with numerous coun- 
terplots and interludes in the offing, 
which, rather than detract from, 
strengthen the personality of the domi- 
nant central figure. It’s a fascinating 
story and we hope you will read it. 

“It Seems to Heywood Broun” in 
the Nation for October.19 that H. L. 
Mencken has overlooked some things 
in summing up the artistic achievement 
of the Negro. But perhaps Mr. 
Mencken does not consider singing, 
dancing and acting art. And in dis- 
cussing our artists, he does not take 
in consideration the difficulties which 
confront us. For instance, says Mr. 
Broun, when Countée Cullen invests 
his poetry with some of the bitterness 
in his soul, he is called a propagandist, 
not a poet; but when he writes of trees 
and whispering winds, he is called an 
imitator of Keats and Shelley. Tell

FE) renee RE 


us, Mr. Mencken, what are we to do? 

In writing of “South Africa Since 
the Revolution” in the Atlantic 
Monthly for August, Lionel Curtis 
says that “everything ultimately hinges 
on the relations of black and white”. 
In South Africa one half of the public 
revenue is derived directly or indirectly 
from the mining industry. Drudgery 
is considered the badge of an inferior 

race and for this reason the poor whites 

fail to acquire skill in farming and 
handicrafts and there is no place fer 
them in the economic system. On the 
other hand, they are accorded their 
full voting rights and the natives, who 
labor in the mines and in the fields, 
are not. Mr. Curtis further discloses 
the political corruption of the Im- 
perial Government and points out that 
the natives can not look to the govern- 
ment to safeguard their rights. 

One phase of the prejudice practiced 
“within the race” is discussed by G. 
A. Steward in Social Forces for Sep- 
tember under the title “The Black 
Girl Passes”. Mr. Steward tells of 
the tragedy of our ebon-hued sister in 
Negro society—how she is shoved into 
the least desirable positions in the eco- 
nomic world and how Negro men, re- 
gardless of the depth of their own 
color, prefer the “teasing brown” and 
“high yellow” types as wives. 


A scientific study of ‘Some Physi- 
cal Characteristics of the American 
Negro Population” by Melville J. 
Herskovits appears in the same issue 
of Social Forces. Mr. Herskovits 
comes to a few interesting conclusions 
regarding the future possibility of a 
homogeneous American Negro type. 

That the Negro can legitimately 
claim at least a fourth of the credit 
for “The Literary Awakening in the 
South” is the opinion of Herschel 
Brickell in the October Bookman. The 
artistic metamorphosis of the South- 
land is due not only to contact and 
education which have resulted in new 
ideas, but also to the migration of the 
Negro to the North. This sweeping 
exodus has broken old industrial tra- 
ditions and has invested the South 
with a new vigor in all lines of activ- 
ity which only a revolutionary change 
can bring about. Mr. Herschel dis- 
cusses the work of a long list of South- 
ern-born literary folk, chief among 
whom are Paul Green, Du Bose Hey- 
ward, T. S. Stribling and Julia Peter- 
kin. All of these people have capital- 
ized the facts of Negro life which they 
meet day by day. 

Wallace Thurman crowds the color- 
ful thing which is Harlem life onto a 
small but complete canvas in the 
Haldeman-Julius Quarterly for Octo- 





ber, November and December. He 
describes ‘““Negro Life in New York’s 
Harlem” from the seething life of the 
“Cotton Club” where dark-tinged 
singers moan weeping blues and wrig- 
gle their sinuous bodies in graceful, 
mad dancing, to the magnificent and 
dignified church edifices, each one 
crowded to capacity on Sunday morn- 
ings; and from the row upon row of 
exclusive apartment hotels housing 
Harlem’s élite, to the upper Fifth Ave- 
nue tenements with their crowds of 
poverty-stricken families. 

Mr. Thurman writes on the same 
subject under the title of “Harlem 
Facets” in the World Tomorrow for 
November; but he does not treat Har- 
lem in this instance with sympathy and 
grace and depth. We don’t like Mr. 
‘Thurman’s half-hearted excuses for the 
lack of energy Harlem Negroes dis- 
play in commercial fields. He says: 
“There are no Negro bankers in Har- 
lem, but there are a great number of 
eminently successful real estate opera- 
tors. There are no capitalistic com- 
bines...., but there are many moneyed 
entrepeneurs operating and owning 
minor businesses. Negroes in Harlem 
do not own a theatre or a dance hall 
of their own, but they do own over 
$60,000,000 worth of real estate... .”

SOCIAL PROGRESS 


@ Five thousand colored victims of 
the recent tornado in St. Louis, Mis- 
souri, were helped by Poro College. 
fifteen hundred were fed each day at 
the college and the auditorium was 
turned into sleeping quarters. 

@ A case which has aroused much in- 
terest among Chinese and Negroes, is 
that of the decision of the school au- 
thorities in the Rosedale school dis- 
trict, Bolivar County, Mississippi, that 
Chinese children should attend schools 
provided for Negroes. The case will 
be brought up before the Supreme 
Court of the United States, which 
must decide whether or not states can 
prohibit the darker races from attend- 
ing schools provided for whites. 

@ The new $500,000 Lincoln Thea- 
ter, one of the finest show houses in 
America catering to colored patronage, 
opened in Los Angeles, California, Oc- 
tober 7. Curtis Carpentier is the Ne- 
gro house manager. 

@ The formal opening of the Ken- 
ney Memorial Hospital at Newark, 
N. J., took place October 14. The 
hospital has modern equipment for 
service in general medicine, surgery 
and gynecology. 

@ A letter of protest has been sent 
to the Chairman of the housing com- 
mittee which placed the delegates to 
the recent convention of the American 
Legion in Paris, France. The protest 
states that all of the Negro delegates 
were sent to one place and that the 
“mere housing of twenty Negroes in 
one place is no mere freak of chance, 
but the result of a well worked out 
plan”. 

@ The Division of Negro Literature 
and History at the West 135 Street 
branch of the New York Public Li- 
brary opened October 1. The Akeley 
Collection from the Congo has been 
augmented by a part of the Blondiau 
Collection of primitive African art 
which was exhibited last spring in New 
York City. 

@ The Dark Tower, a tea room dedi- 
cated to Negro writers, sculptors, mu- 
sicians and composers, was opened re- 


242 


cently in New York City by Mme. 
A’Lelia Walker. 

@ At the Southeastern Fair held at 
Atlanta, Georgia, the week beginning 
October 10, the Negro exhibit was a 
striking evidence of the progress of 
the Negro on the farm, in the home 
and school. The exhibit occupied a 
floor of the agricultural building. 

@ Construction of the $118,000 Y. 
M. C. A. building at Atlantic City, 
N. J., has practically reached comple- 


tion. The building is three stories in 
height and contains a gymnasium, 


reading, locker, shower, class, billiard 
and assembly rooms. The third floor 
contains 30 bedrooms, with sleeping 
accommodations for 66 people. 

@ The report of the United States 
Census of Agriculture of 1925 states 
that: In Oklahoma, out of a colored 
tarm population of 98,044, 42,533 live 
on owned farms; in Arkansas, out of 
277,000, there are 59,583 on owned 
tarms; 115,313 out of a farm popula- 
tion of 524,343 live on owned farms 
in Georgia; Kentucky has a farm 
population of 52,335 with 27,085 liv- 
ing on owned farms; and Tennessee, 
with a colored farm population of 
167,810 has 51,472 living on owned 
farms. 

@ Out of forty-six heroic acts recog- 
nized by the Carnegie Hero fund Com- 
mission recently, two were performed 


by Negroes. Edward A. Mitchell, 


Gloucester Industrial School, Glouces- 
ter County, Va., died trying to save 
a boy from being electrocuted by a 
high-voltage wire at Cambria, Va., 
July 10, 1925. A bronze medal went 
to his widow with death benefits of 
$55 a month with $5 additional for 
each of two children. Luke Erwin, 
Tyler, Texas, saved a farmer from 
suffocating in a well at Ringgold, Ga., 
September 11, 1925. Mr. Erwin re- 
ceived a bronze medal, 

@ Anthony Memorial Hall, the main 
recitation building at Storer College, 
Harpers Ferry, W. Va., was demol- 
ished by flames late in October. It is 
estimated that the total loss was $50,- 
000. The insurance carried was one 
third of that amount. 


EDUCATION 
@ The office of the Fisk Alumni Sec- 
retary, A. J. Allison, was opened 
October 1 with headquarters at Fisk 
University, Nashville, Tenn. This of- 
fice will serve as a clearing house of 
information from the University to 
the alumni and of interesting news 
concerning the progress of Fiskites. 
@ Fisk University paid tribute to the 
founders of the institution and the 
memory of its famed Jubilee Singers 
on October 6. This date was the 56th 
anniversary of the Jubilee Singers, a 
band of nine, who, together with their 
teacher, George L. White, left Nash- 
ville in 1871 to secure funds. 
@ Cheyney Institute, Pa., celebrated 
Cheyney Day October 22. The exer- 
cises were designed to present the work 
of the school in such a way as to 
arouse interest and cooperation on the 
part of Negroes in the work at Chey- 
ney. 


MEETINGS 


@ A meeting to sponsor interracial 
amity, was held October 21 under the 
auspices of the Baha’is of New “York 
and Brooklyn. Among the speakers 
were Horace Holley, Wandeyne 
Mathews and Mrs. Mary H. Ford.

the speakers. 

@ A number of important research 
projects having to do with Negro life 
and conditions were decided upon at 
the recent meeting of the Commission 
on Interracial Cooperation, held at 
Hanover, N. H. The interracial re-

son. 


AFRICAN MANDATES 


@ The Permanent Mandates Com- 
mission at Geneva is a committee un- 
der the League of Nations, which has 
general charge of the former German 
Colonies. There are eleven members 
and M. Van Rees is chairman. Last 
year the commission sought the power 
to question the rights mandatories had 
been assuming and to receive petitions 
from the natives; but South Africa, 
Great Britain and Japan resisted this 
and the right was not granted. The 
Commission has, however, taken South 
Africa to task for its high-handed ac- 
tions in South West Africa, and finds 
a tremendous increase of liquor im- 
portation in the French and British 
Mandates. There were 884,000 litres 
imported into the French Mandate in 
1926 and 545,000 gallons into the Eng- 
lish Gold Coast and Togoland and 
1,350,000 gallons into British Nigeria, 
including the Cameroons. 


LIBERIA 
@ President King of Liberia has vis- 
December, 1927 


ited Germany where he was received 
by the president, Field Marshall Von 
Hindenburg and entertained at lunch- 
eon. Full military honors were given 
him.  Reichs-Chancellor and Mrs. 
Marks gave a banquet for the party. 
In Holland the President and Mrs. 
King were received by the Master of 
Ceremonies to Her Majesty the Queen 
and entertained at dinner by the 
Queen. At Geneva, President King 
was officially received by the secretary 
of the League of Nations, Sir Eric 
Drummond and. by Mr. Albert 
Thomas, Director of the International 
Labor. Organization. He was enter- 
tained at dinner by the Canadian dele- 
gate to the League of Nations. The 
president of the Swiss Republic, Sir 
Austin Chamberlain, and others were 
present. On his return the president 
spent four days in London and then 
went to Liverpool where after vari- 
cus official entertainments, he sailed 
for Africa, October 12, on the Accra. 
This is probably the most distinguished 
series of official receptions that a Negro 
ruler has been accorded in modern 
times. 


ABYSSINIA 


@ The landed wealth of Ethiopia, ac- 
cording to the American Department 
of Commerce, is enormous. Not only 
has it rich soil suitable for grain and 
rubber, but it also has stores of coal, 
copper, silver, iron, potash and mica. 
Coffee grows wild and one million do!- 
lars worth is already being exported 
annually. The imports are chiefly 
salt and cotton goods. Salt, and silver 


dollars made in Austria, are the cur- 
rency. The silver is horded. 

@ The American Pro-Falasha Com- 
mittee of Jews have raised $50,000 for 
work among the black Jews of Abys- 
sinia. A college is to be established 


at Addis-Abeba. 


WEST AFRICA 


@ Seventeen colored civil servants of 
the Gold Coast have been awarded 
certificates and badges of honor by 
King George for service to the colony. 
@ Nigeria spent for public health 
£285,000 in 1925 and £475,000 in 
1926. The birth rate is estimated at 
29.9 per mille and the death rate 27.3. 
The infant mortality shows that one- 
third of the children die before they 
are five years old. Hospitalization is 
being pushed. 

@ Great Britain, after attacking 
Abyssinia for slavery, has found her- 
self with a slave problem in Sierra 
Leone. Domestic slavery had never 
been abolished and by legal decision 
last July, runaway slaves could be 
recaptured. After January 1, 1928, 
the legal status of slavery will ite abol- 
ished. This will affect between two 
and three hundred thousand slaves. 
@ Mrs. Caseley Hayford has returned 
from America to her Girls Vocational 
School in Sierra Leone. An Ameri- 
can Committee consisting of three 
white and three colored persons, under 
Professor Mabel Carney of Columbia, 
has provided for thirty scholarships. 
@ Solomon B. Taylor, who received 
his Masters degree in agriculture at 
Cornell, has been appointed by the 
Sierra Leone Government as principal 
of the Nyala School. Paul O. Cor- 
doza of Lagos, has received the same 
degree from Cornell and I. Phillips 
of Nigeria has received his B. S. de- 
gree with honors at Birmingham Uni- 
versity, England. 

@ During the past twenty-five years 
the revenue of the Gold Coast has 
risen from £333,283 to £4,365,320. 
The two chief causes of this rapid 
progress are cocoa and shipping.

HICAGO is rapidly becoming 

one of the most artistic cities in 

the United States through its 
magnificent public buildings, its won- 
derful’ parks and its system of beauti- 
ful boulevards. 

There are spots in this great city, 
however, of which we never boast and 
which we would like to hide from the 
eyes of sight-seers but, unfortunately, 
our elevated railroads pass through 
some of these most. unsightly neighbor- 
hoods. It is bad enough for our own 
eyes to be continuously assaulted with 
such dirt and disorder but the effect 
on our visitors is most detrimental to 
Our civic reputation. 

If, after passing through such a lo- 
cality for several years you should ac- 
cidentally glance out upon a vista of 
beautiful back yards; tastefully painted 
homes with fresh, clean curtains at the 
windows, flowers and vines making in- 
teresting patterns against walls and 
fences; neatly clad people quietly at- 
tending their tasks; clean looking chil- 
dren picking up papers and burning 
rubbish in streets and alleys; velvety

you might wonder what all-powerful 
mixture it had been your luck to have 
tasted that morning. 

Yet such a change of appearance is 
by no means as impractical as it might 
seem and, with such an ideal in mind, 
for their community, an earnest little 
group of artists and their friends met 
and organized the Chicago Art 
League, which, for the past four years 
has functioned as a special division of 
the Educational Department of the 
Wabash Y. M. C. A., carrying on its 
work through lectures, demonstrations, 
exhibitions and special articles con- 
tributed to the press by its members. 

You may be interested in the per- 
sonnel of the Chicago Art League. 
Nine of its members, one a winner in 
1923 of a national poster contest, one 
a mural painter of distinction, one a 
member of the staff of the Art Insti- 
tute of Chicago, and three who have 
exhibited in local, national, or inter- 
national exhibitions at the Art Insti- 
tute and other museums or galleries 
of equal importance, are making their

THE FAR HORIZON

THE HAMPTON STRIKE 
N ONLOOKER writes us: 
“Now that the strike is over, 
the task seems to be to explain to the 
outside world what caused the great- 
est upheaval in Hampton’s history. 

‘Through my own observations and 
experiences, and what I have learned 
from others I have become keenly 
aware of the state of hypocrisy, racial 
prejudice, and backwardness into 
which Hampton has fallen. I myself 
have suffered keenly and racial antip- 
athy has grown within me. 

“Rumors of the general unrest 
among the students and of the pr.s- 
nects of an uprising had reached me 
a week or two before the incident oc- 
curred which kindled the flame. Con- 
sequentiy, at the moment of its in- 
cipiency, some of us realized the seri- 
ousness of the situation, but we were 
in a sad minority. Others laughed 
and scored the childish actions of the 
students, calling them fools. 


“The administration forced the 
issue which resulted in practically 
seven hundred students leaving the 


campus last Friday and Saturday by 
the very domineering and unsympa- 
thetic manner in which they handled 
the situation from beginning to end. 
Dr. Gregg publicly acknowledged to 
the students that he was somewhat 
hasty in his first ultimatum of last 
Monday. The sad part of the situa- 
tion was, however, that they did not 
profit by their first mistakes and con- 
tinued on with the same threatening, 
nonconciliatury policy which precipi- 
tated the disaster. Even now they do 
not realize that Hampton has been 
dealt a serious blow, and are carrying 
on in the same high-handed manner, 
not realizing if every student should 
return, the Administrative Board 
failed in ever forcing them to leave. 

“Very much depends on public opin- 
ion in this affair. The authorities are 
crediting this strike as the work of 
disobedient boys and girls who were 
led on to do what they did. On the 
other hand, each student I have talked 
with has impressed me with the seri- 
ous attitude he has taken in the mat- 
ter—with each one of them it became 
a holy cause. The strike to them was 
not a prank, in fact it was partly 
forced on them; but when they found 
themselves too deeply involved to back 
out, they went straight ahead with 
great religious fervor. Previous peti- 
tions have always been ignored; their 


December, 1927 


student council has six faculty mem- 
bers; and they felt drastic action was 
necessary if they were to be heard this 
time. Many are arguing that the stu- 
dents went about their strike in the 
wrong manner; but be that as it may, 
they carried it through in an orderly 
and manly fashion that brought com- 
mendation on every side. 

“The next thing is, of course, what 
is to come of it? Classes began in- 
formally this morning to occupy those 
students that are on the grounds. The 
formal opening is scheduled for Octo- 
ber 25. The authorities are very op- 
timistic and feel that all will go on 
as before. Others of us do not feel 
as confident. Last night there were 
300 students here; today, others have 
come in so that there are possibly 400. 
Many are here because of parental or- 
der and others, because they have no 
other alternative. It has been a ter- 
rible ordeal to witness the struggle 
some of them have gone through, teel- 
ing that they cannot stay, yet cannot 
go. Many may return, but I fear 
that a feeling of dissatisfaction and 
unrest will be present in them in a 
greater degree than ever. Some have 
found that other schools have closed 
their doors to them; others away from 
the crowd have lost their enthusiasm. 
But there are others who will neve 
return, and they are the best of the 
school. Dr. Gregg acknowledged that 
the leaders in the strike were the fore- 
most men on the campus and _ those 
who had been some years in the in- 
stitution. The wholesale slaughter 
that has come about of the school’s 
best is too great for good to come of 
it and the Negro world should be 
made to see the justice in the students’ 
stand. 

“The conciliatory steps taken by 
some of the white teachers have been 
most amusing. ‘They threw aside the 
protecting garment of the Massenburg 
Bill and the wife of the most preju- 
diced leader on the campus, whose 
home is never open to any but the 
white teachers, sponsored auto partics 
to take the girls to Yorktown, some 
thirty miles away! Other white- 
haired ladies wandered around with 
checker boards, organized sewing bees, 
gave teas in their rooms, pop-corn par- 
ties, and other rather silly amusements 
as a sop. They cannot realize that 
there has been a fundamental upheaval 
which cannot be appeased by simple 
pastimes. Many pleaded with tears in 


their eyes to no avail, for the girls 
laughed in their faces. They cannot 
understand that these students for 
whom they have sacrificed their lives 
to ‘civilize’, (in the meantime receiv- 
ing very comfortable salaries and liv- 
ing quarters which they might have 
difficulty in securing elsewhere) cou!d 
feel anything but the deepest respect 
and gratitude toward them. 

“The teachers as a body do not un- . 
derstand these Negro students, the Ad- 
ministrative Board does not understand 
them, Dr. Gregg does not understand 
them—and the tragedy is that they 
never will. I have found a few, a 
very few white people who believe in 
the ideal for which Hampton is sup- 
posed to stand, but whose faith has 
been deeply shaken by this whole af- 
fair. As a friend said to me the other 
day: ‘I believe that interracial ex- 
periments will always fail, not because 
of the impossibility to effect them, but 
because we cannot be careful enough 
in the selection of representatives of 
each side’. 





“Dr. Gregg at a workers’ meeting 
last evening issued an ultimatum to 
workers as well. He said that he 
had been made aware that there were 
those among them who were student 
sympathizers and such persons as these 
were not wanted at Hampton under 
the regime of the present Administra- 
tion. Loyalty on the part of the teach- 
ers to the present administration is 
just as necessary as the loyalty of stu- 
dents, and those who felt that they 
cannot back up the present policies 
were politely asked to get out.” 

A citizen writes: 

“The students claim that ever since 
the iniquitous Massenburg Bill which 
required the separation of the races in 
public halls of Virginia, including 
Hampton School, that the Principal 
of the school has been less social with 
the students than ever before; that he 
has placed in some of the trades de- 
partments of the school white .nen 
from the Ku Klux sections of the Pen- 
insula, one of whom died and was 
buried with honors from the Kluxers; 
that members of the faculty from the 
North have referred to the students 
as ‘heathen’, without, of course, desig- 
nating any particular misdemeanant 
and that it has been assumed that the 
students were of such low character 
that they would undertake sexual con- 
tact during a play unless the lights 
were on, even to the extent of destroy- 


345 











ing the effect of the moving pictures 
or play. Even men who are now em- 
ployed at the school say that conditions 
there had become almost intolerable 
because of a subtle influence, such as 
putting white men over Negroes, some 
of whom could not write a sentence of 
English correctly. The whole atmos- 
phere at Hampton has changed since 
the Editor of the Daily Press sought 
and succeeded in having a law passed 
separating the races in public halls.” 

The white Virginian-Pilot adds in 
a leading editorial: 

“Down in Alabama student leaders 
in the State Polytechnic Institute, a 
white institution, are petitioning the 
board of trustees to remove the presi- 
dent. At Hampton Institute, a col- 
ored establishment, the mutiny is of 
another order, but of the same generic 
origin—the new critical attitude that 
is sweeping American undergraduate 
bodies. The day of the humble stu- 
dent body accepting uncritically and 
unprotestingly every item of the re- 
gime prescribed for them by the fac- 
ulty and administrative officers, is 
about over. To dismiss this develop 
ment cavalierly as part of the un- 
American Youth Movement, is not to 
do it justice. The phenomenon is bet- 
ter understood as part of the shedding 
of repressions that is characteristic of 
today’s vouth nearly everywhere in the 
world, particularly in the United 
States. What student bodies sense as 
grievances, what they regard as admin- 
istrative shortcomings, are no longer 
to be brusquely brushed aside as incon- 
sequential. Between faculty and stu- 
dents there must be a sort of partner- 
ship, and a partnership, to be a suc- 
cess, must rest on mutual confidence 
and co-operation. 

Such facts as have come to light 
about the trouble at Hampton suggest 
that the students acted too peremptor- 
ily. The strike is an ugly weapon— 
distinctly not the weapon suited to 
righting of undergraduate grievances. 
But the grievances remain and must 
be dealt with. Those that are with- 
out foundation will fall of their own 
weight, but those that have substance, 
will continue to plague the Hampton 
administration until they are cor- 
rected.”

THE BLACK VOTER 

HICKENS are coming home to 

roost. The story 1s told in “The 
Solid South” a printed address deliv- 
ered by Henry W. Anderson at the 
Institute of Public Affairs held at the 
University of Virginia last August. 
He tells of the disfranchisement of 
the Negro, 1905-10: 


“The avowed purpose of these con- 
stitutions and laws was to eliminate 
the Negro vote without violating the 
Fifteenth Amendment to the Federai 
Constitution. This was generally ac- 
complished by fixing difficult and com- 
plicated requirements for registration 
and voting, with exceptions which only 
applied to certain limited classes; by 
vesting discretionary powers in regis: 
trars and other election officers which 
could be exercised in favor of those 
friendly to the dominant organization 
and against its opponents; and by so 
arranging the electoral machinery that 
it could always be controlled by the 
dominant organization regardless of 
the political majority in the local com- 
munities. 

It is not surprising that these people 
who had been harassed by problems of 
supreme difficulty for a generation 
should have turned to any measures 
which promised relief. It is unfor- 
tunately true, however, that many of 


the mistakes which have been most 
fatal to or destructive of human free- 
dom in the past have been inspired by 
motives equally worthy, and the 
Southern people were now to be taught 
again the age-old lesson that a free 
civilization cannot be built upon op- 
pression of minorities, or unjust laws; 
that discriminatory legislation, how- 
ever worthy its purpose, only places 
in the hands of the unscrupulous a 
power which will inevitably be used 
to maintain control of government, and 
if permitted to continue must lead to 
the destruction of all social and po- 
litical freedom. The results of these 
measures were soon made manifest. 

The primary purpose of these new 
constitutions or laws was soon effected. 
The Negroes were disfranchised. The 
Negro vote has since been so small 
that it is no longer a material factor 
in the political situation. But the 
process of disfranchisement did not 
stop there. The machinery of dis- 
crimination, devised primarily for this 
purpose, was then employed by the 
dominant party organization to effect 
a disqualification of a large proportion 
of the white population opposed to 
that organization, while unchallenged 
control of one political group permitted 
or encouraged political corruption. As 
a result of these measures the vote 
qualified or cast in the Southern States 
has been so reduced that it includes 
only a small minority of the popula- 
tion. So small is this vote that the 
State and local officeholders constitute 
or easily control a majority. Gov- 
ernors and other State officers are 
sometimes elected by less than 10 per 
cent of the population of voting age. 
The politically Solid South is thus 
maintained, but at the price of politi- 
cal freedom. A large majority of the 
people of these States no longer have 
any part in their government. The 
free expression of the will of the peo- 
ple no longer exists. Popular govern- 
ment has thus been destroyed, and 
there have been substituted in its 
stead self-perpetuating political oligar- 
chies, controlled by the office-holding 
groups in the several States who are 
obedient to the party organizations and 
use the agencies of government and 
the taxing power to maintain the con- 
trol of those organizations. 

This condition will more clearly ap- 
pear from an examination of the ac- 
tual vote in presidential elections, 
which is generally larger than in State 
and local elections. In 1888 the com- 
bined population of the eleven South- 
ern States was in round numbers 15,- 
500,000. Women were not then vot- 
ing. In the presidential election of 
that year the eleven States of the Solid 
South cast an aggregate of 2,100,000 
votes, or approximately one vote for 
every seven of (Turn to page 351)

THE BUSINESS PRIZES 


HERE were also offered in our 

prize announcement, $725 for 
short stories, essays and cartoons “to 
stimulate general knowledge of bank- 
ing and insurance in modern life and 
specific knowledge of what American 
Negroes are doing in these fields, and 
to collect facts for impressions concern- 
ing Negro workers and their relation 
to Negro business”’. 


To our great surprise only 13 of the 
375 entries were made for this com- 
petition. This, we think, is much too 
small a number and with the consent of 
the donors, therefore, we are extend- 
ing the time of entry for these prizes 
until July Ist, 1928. As a prominent 
Negro Life Insurance Company Presi- 
dent writes us: 

“This situation brings to mind very 
forcibly the fact that there is not 
enough interest on the part of either 
the young people, or the public gen- 
erally, in the development of business. 
Some way must be devised whereby 
more thought can be given to business 
than has been given in the past. 

“T am very glad to know that THE 
Crisis is going to continue to call at- 
tention to this phase of our racial life 
and that it will continue to hammer 
on this proposition until some sort of 
spirit has been developed.” 


OTHING is more startling or 

interesting than the economic de- 
velopment of the American Negro 
from slavery to freedom. ‘The story 
should engage the attention of our 
best thinkers and writers. We are 
going to do everything we can during 
the next year to direct the attention 
of young writers and artists to this 
phase of our development, and we 
offer for the year 1928, at least $725 
in prizes. Those who have already 
entered articles may leave them with 
us for final judgment or may revise 
them or may send others. 


THE HAMPTON STRIKE 


HE most sinister thing about the 

Hampton strike, is not the atti- 
tude of the authorities of Hampton. 
It has long been known, and the 
knowledge discounted among American 
Negroes, that Hampton trustees and 
teachers did not all have feelings, 
opinions or ideals toward American 
Negroes, which were acceptable to self- 
respecting black men. There has al- 
ways been at Hampton a degree of 
race discrimination and of repression 
that has been hateful and exasperating. 
It has long been endured, just as beg- 
gars often endure the insult of impu- 
dent almsgiving. The time for an end 
to that endurance is surely at hand, 


347 








unless we Negroes are willing to bring 
up our children in the same attitude 
of subserviency and uncomplaining 
submission to caste which our fathers 
inherited from slavery. The Hamp- 
ton attitude must be distinctly and 
firmly repudiated. 

But the most disconcerting thing in 
the Hampton strike is the way in which 
graduates and parents repudiated their 
own children. The best of schools is 
imperfect. The worse is intolerable. 
The students present upon the grounds 
are in the long run the best and only 
judges of the efficiency of the educa- 
tion offered. They are far better 
judges than parents or alumni. If 
mature college students believe that a 
school is going wrong, what are they 
going to do but openly protest? In 
any white northern college that pro- 
test would immediately be heeded, even 
if accompanied by violence, and there 
would not be any silly insistance upon 
dumb, unthinking obedience. Students 
are not sent to school to learn to obey. 
They are sent there to learn to do, to 
think, to execute, to be men and wo- 
men. Self-reliance, self-expression, 
honesty and decision are to be learned 
in school if anywhere. We complain 
bitterly of the lack of these qualities 
in our young people, but do we en- 
courage their development? At Fisk 
and at Hampton there were parents 
and alumni who turned upon their own 
children like wild beasts, ready to beat 
them into submission; insisting that 
even if the school authorities were 
wrong, it was the business of black 
boys and girls to submit. At Hamp- 
ton, the Alumni actually published to 
the world a statement; declaring, first, 
that they gave complete approval and 
consent to what the Hampton authori- 
ties had done, including the wholesale 
suspensions, and then, finally, promis- 
ing that they would investigate. 

Negro colleges with few exceptions 
are standing together to punish and 
penalize for life and exclude from all 
chances of education the brave, orderly 
and clear-headed young men and wo- 
men who led -the Hampton strike, just 
because Hampton tells them to. 

At this rate, what will the next gen- 
eration be? What kind of crawling 
cowards are we seeking to spawn? It 
is possible, indeed, it is probable, that 
striking students at Hampton, Fisk, 
Shaw, Howard and elsewhere, have 
made their mistakes, but there is abso- 
lutely no question or shadow of doubt 
but that when 400 students, well- 
trained, orderly, with excellent rec- 
ords, are willing to take their future 
in their hands and jeopardize their 
whole lives in an appeal to the world 
for justice, that something must be 
absolutely and radically wrong, and 
the business of parents and Alumni is 


348 


to investigate before they condemn, to 
encourage and uphold their protesting 
children, instead of cowing and dis- 
gracing them. It is the Principal and 
Faculty of Hampton that are really 
at the bar of Justice and not the stu- 
dents who refused to sing for the en- 
tertainment of a white Englishman. 


THE DURHAM CONFERENCE 
HE Conference meeting this 
month at Durham, North Caro- 

lina, is unusual. It is not an attempt 
to unite existing organizations in an 
impossible federation for which there 
is neither demand nor need. It is not 
an attempt to form a new organiza- 
tion. It is a simple, straight-forward 
effort to ascertain facts and to take 
stock. 

There has been too little of this kind 
of meeting. We are so anxious to 
right our wrongs that we usually do 
not have time to find out just what 
the wrongs are. We want more work 
and better wages, but what work are 
we doing and what wages are we re- 
ceiving? We want to go into busi- 
ness, but what business are we con- 
ducting at present and how success- 
fully? We want to spread banking 
and insurance, but what is the condi- 
tion of our banks and insurance so- 
cieties today? We complain of the 
lack of religious belief, but what are 
our churches doing to foster it? We 
inveigh against disfranchisement, but 
how far are we really disfranchised ? 
We demand education, but what 
chances for education have we now? 
We periodically “die out”, but what 
is the real condition of our health? 
We are astonished at Negro crime, but 
how much Negro crime is there? 

All these questions, this Conference 
seeks to answer: first by hearing a 
documentory report on present condi- 
tions, prepared by an expert; and sec- 
ond, by hearing just what organized 
work is doing to better conditions; and 
then with these facts, the Conference 
is debating the question of improving 
the work of existing organizations; of 
indicating further work; and pointing 
out the necessity, if any, of further 
organization. 

Such a_ conference is 
worth-while. 


distinctly 


TEN YEARS 

T is astonishing to see the determina- 

tion with which those who believe 
in the industrial methods of America 
and Western Europe are spreading 
misinformation concerning the Russian 
experiment. The central thing which 
has happened in Russia is this: the rot- 
ten, horrible, inexpressibly brutal and 
silly tyranny of the Czar, has been 
definitely and finally overthrown. No 


such travesty on decent government 
has existed elsewhere in Europe in 
modern days. It was a stench in the 
nostrils of humanity. It was flamboy- 
ant and impudent with murder and 
cruelty, on a foundation of ignorance 
and poverty and with flaming towers 
of ostentation and show which com- 
pletely captivated the organized snob- 
bery of the world. ‘To be presented 
at the Russian Imperial Court was 
the last round in the ladder of ambi- 
tion for every social climber in Europe 
and America. 

The rottenness of the Czar’s Gov- 
ernment was repeatedly exposed to the 
liberal world. Not a finger was raised 
tc help. On the contrary, when in 
desperation Russia rose in 1905 to 
shake off medieval despotism and es- 
tablish modern democracy, Western 
Europe poured its treasure into the 
hands of the Czar to beat the wretched 
Revolutionists back. Now _ finally, 
when of their own strength and deter- 
mination, and their own vast will to 
sacrifice, the Russian people have 
buried Czarism and tried to establish 
a new government that frankly faces 
the economic problem which the world 
fears to face, there is scarcely a news- 
paper in America that will give this ex- 
periment even decent hearing. Yet 
the Union of Socialist Soviet Repub- 
lics is celebrating today its Tenth An- 
niversary, and here’s hoping that this 
is but the first decade toward its hun- 
dred years. 


PULLMAN PORTERS 
eo bribes which have ‘been 

directly and indirectly distributed 
in the effort to kill off the Union move- 
ment among Pullman Porters, we are 
pleased to see that they are fighting 
on. It is pitiable to note how some 
colored papers rejoice at every setback 
which the porters experience, and to 
see others because the 
union is not immediately successful. 
But what did we expect? Did any 
sane man think that the cause of col- 
lective bargaining in the case of Pull- 
man Porters, with all the wealth and 


discouraged 


influence of the Pullman Company 
against them, and with organized 


white labor less than neutral, was go- 
ing to triumph in a day? The por- 
ters have a fight of a generation be- 
fore them. They are going to be 
beaten again and again, but they are 
going to win some day, if they eter- 
nally stick to it; if they twist and turn, 
attack now here and now there, re- 
turn to the attack when beaten and 
insist that public almsgiving for the 
support of skilled labor is nothing less 
than stealing, foisted by the Pullman 
Car Company on a public which is too 
inert and short-sighted to stop it.

Jesse Binga 
(From page 329) time he was a huck- 
ster and then in 1898 he entered the 
real estate business at 3331 South State 
Street with a very limited capital. 
Here his business prospered and he 
sought more pretentious quarters at 
3637 State Street. This was a seven 
story flat building on which he took 
a long term lease. Heretofore the 
only homes eligible to our group in 
Chicago were west of State Street and 
this building proved the opening wedge 
for them to procure modern places in 
which to live. Next door to this build- 
ing on the corner of Thirty-sixth Place 
and State Street was a vacant lot. He 
persuaded the owners to erect a three 
story building on the ground accord- 
ing to his plans, on which he took an- 
other long term lease. Before either 
lease had expired, he had purchased 
both buildings. Later he took a thirty 
year leasehold on a block of buildings 
on State Street between Forty-seventh 
and Forty-eighth Streets, which he

now owns. At one time his leaseholds 
on property amounted to about 1,200 
flats and residences and it was through 
this agency of leaseholds that enabled 
him to place his people east of State 
Street and in desirable residential dis- 
tricts. Other than that, it would have 
taken millions of dollars of capital, 
which they did not have. 


- the new building at the southeast 
corner of 36th Place and State 
Street, he opened his private bank in 
1908. Although small, here he laid 
the foundation for the state institution 
which was opened January 3, 1921. 
Always he had before him a vision—a

the beautiful institution which bears 
his name at State Street and Thirty- 
fifth, where he is endeavoring to ad- 
vance the economic status of our group 
and teach lessons of thrift. On its 
portals are inscribed the words ““Affli- 
ated Member Chicago Clearing House 
Association” and no bank can wish for 
a better standing in any community. 
It is the only bank in the vicinity that 
enjoys such a distinction. 

Most people think of him as a man 
who always drives a hard bargain but 
it is because they know only one side 
of his character. Few men give as 
much to charity as he does. This spirit 
of charity which is paramount in his 
character is another trait which he 
inherited from his mother. More than 
fifty years ago in Detroit she built 
tenement flats of three and four rooms 
each known in those days as “Binga 
Row”. She never was known to dis- 
possess a poor family in winter and 
when it came to her knowledge that a 
family was in need of food, she always 
had her son Jesse deliver them provi- 
sions. That trait stays with him and 
many a family owes its very existence 
to his charity. He has paid the tuition 
of many of the young men and women 
now and formerly in his employ, thus 
enabling them to advance their educa- 
tion and still earn a decent living. 
Although not a college graduate him- 
self, he has given liberally to Fisk, 
Howard and Atlanta. He is a Catho- 
lic but never lets his religion interfere 
when it comes to helping others, re- 
gardless of creed or color. 


He is a man of stern character with 
an iron will and a master of the prob- 
lems which confront him. He has 
lived to that age that few men of our 
race have been permitted to see and 
enjoy—the permanent development of 
their life’s work.

Drab Rambles 


(From page 336) was when she first 
came from Georgia. She had liked 
things then. Liked the job, liked the 
church she joined, liked Tom Nolan, 
the man for whom she washed dishes. 


NE day his wife asked Madie if 

she had a husband. She told 
her no. She was paid off. Madie, 
the second, was born soon after. 
Madie named her  unquestioningly 
Madie Frye. It never occurred to her 
to name her Nolan, which would have 
been proper. 

Madie bore her pain in silence, bore 
her baby in a charity ward, thanked 
God for the kindness of a North and 
thanked God that she was not back 
in Culvert when Madie was born, for 
she would have been turned out of 
church. 

Madie stopped singing aloud then. 
She tried to get jobs—dishwashing— 
cleaning—washing clothes—but you 
cannot keep a job washing someone’s 
clothes or cleaning their house and 
nurse a baby and keep it from yelling 
the lady of the house into yelling tan-

December, 1627 


Madie, second, lost for her mother 
exactly two dozen jobs between her 
advent and her tenth month in her 
mother’s arms. 

Madie had not had time to feel 
sorry for herself at first. She was too 
busy wondering how long she could 
hold each job. Could she keep Madie 
quiet until she paid her room rent? 
Could she keep Mrs. Jones from know- 
ing that Madie was down under the 
cellar stairs in a basket every day while 
she was upstairs cleaning, until she 
got a pair of shoes? 

By the time she went to work in 
Kale’s Hand Laundry, she had found 
the baby a too great handicap to take 
to work. She began to leave Madie 
with her next door neighbor, Mrs. 
Sundell, who went to church three 
times every Sunday and once in the 
week. She must be good enough to 
keep Madie while her mother worked. 
She was. She kept Madie for two 
dollars a week and Madie kept quiet 
for her and slept all night long when 
she reached home with her mother. 
Her mother marvelled and asked Mrs. 
Sundell how she did it. 

“Every time she cries, I give her 
paregoric. Good for her stomach.” 


O the baby grew calmer and calmer 

each day. Calmer and quieter. 
Her mother worked and steamed si- 
iently down in Kale’s_ tub-room. 
Worked, shouting songs of thanksgiv- 
ing within her for steady money and 
peaceful nights. 

June set in, and with it, scorching 
days. Days that made the thick steam 
fuil of lye and washing-powder eat 
the lining out of your lungs. There 
was a set of rules tacked up inside the 
big door that led into the checking- 
room that. plainly said: “This door 
is never to be opened between the hours 
of six in the morning and twelve noon. 
Nor between the hours of one and six 
p.m.” 

That was to keep the steam from 
the checkers. They were all white and 
could read and write so they were 
checkers, 

One day Madie put too much lye 
in some boiling water. It choked her. 
When she drew her next breath, she 
was holding her head in the clean cool 
air of the checking-room. She drew 
in a deep breath and coughed. A man 
spun across the floor and a white hand 
shot to the door. ‘‘Why the hell don’t 
you obey rules?” He slammed the 
door and Madie stumbled back down 
the stairs. 

A girl at the end tub looked around. 
“Was that Mr. Payne?” she asked. 

Madie was still dazed; ‘Mr. 
Payne?” she asked. 

“Yah. The man what closed 
door.”

“The Company You Will Eventually Insure With” 





“T don’t know who he was.” 

The other laughed and drew closer 
to her. “Better know who he is,” 
she said. 

Madie blinked up at her. 

The girl cocked an eye: “Good to 
know him. You can stay off some- 
times—if he likes you.” That was all 
that day. 


rene day Madie was going 
home. Her blank brown face 
was freshly powdered and she went 
quietly across the checking-room. The 
room was empty it seemed at first. All 
the girls were gone. When Madie 
was half across the room she saw a 
man sitting in the corner behind a desk. 
He looked at her as soon as she looked 
at him. It was the man who had 
yanked the door out of her hand, she 
thought. Fear took hold of her. She 
began to rush. 

Someone called. It was the man at 
the desk. “‘Hey, what’s your rush?” 
The voice was not loud and bloody 
this time. It was soft—soft—soft— 
like a cat’s foot. Madie stood still 
afraid to go forward—afraid to turn 
around. 

“What, are you afraid of me?” 
Soft like a cat’s foot. “Come here.” 

—Good to know him— 

Madie made the space to the outer 
door in one stride. The door opened 
in. She pushed against it. 

“Aw, what’s the matter with you?” 
Foot-steps brought the voice nearer. 
A white hand fitted over the door- 
knob as she slid hers quickly away. 


ADIE could not breathe. Neither 

could she lift her eyes. The 
door opened slowly. She had to move 
backwards to give it space. Another 
white hand brushed the softness of her 
body. 

She stumbled out into the alley. 
Cold sweat stood out on her. 

Madie second had cost her jobs and 
jobs. She came by Madie keeping that 
first job. 

Madie was black brown. The baby 
was yellow. Was she now going to 
go job hunting or have a sister or 
brother to keep with Madie second? 

Cold perspiration sent her shivering 
in the alley. 

And Madie cursed aloud. 


“Why?” 





Not in my day or your tomorrow— 
perhaps—but somewhere in God’s day 
of meting—somewhere in God’s day 
of measuring full measures overflow- 
ing—the blood will flow back to you 
—and you will care.

(From page 339) that they own minor 
businesses and $60,000,000 worth of 
‘real estate. They are in Harlem to 
stay and how can they determine the 
quality of Harlem without a monopoly 
on the public enterprises of Harlem? 
We feel sure that our Jewish friends 
would consider it not a little presump- 
tious were we to take possession of the 
businesses of the East Side. 

And now the students at Hampton 
Institute, Virginia, have struck! In 
the Nation for November 2, W. E. B. 
Du Bois in his own inimitable man- 
ner, makes a clear statement of the 
reasons for the strike and why black 
America must stand to a man behind 
these brave young men and women. 
The day has passed when white philan- 
thropy can throw in the face of young 
Negro America a curriculum dictated 
by the plantation owners of the South 
and expect it to grin and swallow it, 
even in part.

other is an instructor in architecture; 
two others instructors in art in High 
Schools, three or four more are in- 
structors in the graded schools; others 
are students and persons interested 
art. Besides these are a writer of some 
distinction, a lawyer and a member of 
the staff of the Chicago Public Library. 

The Chicago Art League has en- 
couraged aspiring young people to per- 
severe more seriously in their study of 
art. Its gospel of ‘clean up and beau- 
tify” has been echoed by community 
organizations with excellent results. It 
has been instrumental in securing 
paintings for several schools and pub- 
lic buildings in the community. It 
is attempting to raise funds to estab- 


lish a scholarship for worthy students 
at the Art Institute.

So far we have asked nothing of the 
general public. But the worth of this 
project leads us to believe that, in or- 
der to be most effective, we must en- 
list the interest and moral support of 
a larger number of people. Conse- 
quently, our books are open for finan- 
cial aid in the way of general funds, 
the scholarship fund and for new mem- 
berships. 

We believe that art is a fundamen- 
tal to good citizenship; that in instill- 
ing this -virtue into our community 
we are materially assisting this great 
city in one of its most serious problems 
and setting an example which can eas- 
ily be followed by other communities. 

There are many people who have 
lived in Chicago for years and yet have 
never visited the Art Institute. 
Whether the two bronze lions at the 
entrance prove too much for their cour- 
age, | do not know. Among this num- 
ber are many from the community and 
racial group we are serving. In order 
to awaken their interest and cultivate 
their tastes we strive to bring as much 
art as possible within their reach. 

With this in view we have held an- 
nual exhibitions of work in the fine 
and applied arts to which a cordial in- 
vitation has been extended to artists of 
our group throughout the country. 


AN OPPORTUNITY! 


A young insurance company that believes itself 
progressive, needs a college-trained man, prefer- 
ably unmarried, who has studied business, and 
particularly insurance accounting, to study its 
books and records and finally assume charge of 
them. 


The salary will be small at the start, but the 
Company is growing rapidly and the opportunity 
is believed worth the attention of those who 
can qualify. The Company is located in a large 
Northern City. 


This man is needed at once, but we prefer to 
secure the type who will furnish first-class ref- 
erences and who wants to maintain good con- 
nections with a present employer. Our own 
employes know about this advertisement so you 
need have no hesitancy in writing in confidence.
