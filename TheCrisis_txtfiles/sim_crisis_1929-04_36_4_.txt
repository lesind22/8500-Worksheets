A LIFE TIME, AT BEST IS SO SHORT, 
—AND UNCERTAIN! 


VERY adult person realizes this grim fact. Added responsibilities force the realization 
upon us if we try to think of something else. 


What is this Life Time, uncertain as it is, to mean to us or to others? Better 
clothes, ‘a larger home, more expensive furniture, a new car every year or two, more expen- 
sive clubs, more and finer pleasures—with the Grim Reaper off to one side, gravely watching 


the mad race, biding his time? Perhaps Time drags on, and Want mocks our steps. When the 
hour strikes—what is left? 


How much better, now, to meet the issue, frankly, to use the only means so far devised to discount the uncertainty 
of this thing called a Life Time? 


To live the full life is good. Did you ever realize how much better it is to be assured that the debts you now have 
can be paid, the home you now have kept intact, the education of children completed, and these children provided 
resources with which to establish themselves in a more exacting future? All this can be accomplished in a Life 
Time with certainty only if you provide in the early years sufficient life insurance to continue in the future the 
standards you now enjoy. 


The small sacrifice of present pleasure can become a real enjoyment as the years go by and you see contentment 
accumulating for you and those near you 


The Victory Life Insurance Company is in business to provide a contented Old Age for you, and continued happi- 
ness for your family despite the uncertainties of this thing called a Life Time. | Our many plans of insurance make 
the present sacrifice a minimum. Mail the coupon below for the booklet without obligation to you.

William Jennings Bryan’s Fundamentalist onslaught at Dayton, Tenn., who is internationally 
known as an outstanding American liberal, rationalist, iconoclast, freethinker, and defender 
of the man who is down; who pleaded for the lives of the two boy killers, Loeb and 
Leopold, in Chicago; who defended Dr. Sweet, a Negro, against a charge of murder incurred 
when the man protected his home with firearms from a threatening mob. Read _ these 
amazing books. Learn of the powerful, liberalizing, progressive influence of this great man. 
The cost is only $1—we pay the postage. This is undoubtedly the greatest bargain in the

POSTSCRIPT. By W. E. B. Du Bois 


ND now it’s President Hoover; 
the top of the morning to him 


and thank God there is no white 
Southerner in his cabinet to advise him 
about ‘“Niggers”.—Also, goodbye to 
Doak. THE Crisis did not eliminate 
him but we helped.—O how angry and 
implacable was Deterding! How nasty 
was Russian oil! How perfidious the 
Soviets! And then having scared off 
most American and French competi- 
tion, England comes to terms with 
Russia—R. R. Wright writes us: “I 
protest! What does Tex Rickard know 
about Heaven ?”—Chicago has invest- 
ed in crime for 30 years and made mil- 
lions. She will not abolish it in 30 
days—The records show that we spent 
17 million dollars to elect a president. 
Add the unrecorded millions to this 
and it is clear that bribery has no place 
in American political life—The moon 
around the earth, the earth around the 
sun, and the sun around the center of the 
Milky Way every three hundred million 
years. What is man ?—The joke about 
amateur” sport in the United States 
is surely laughable, with Tilden lead- 
ing the laughter.—Liang Chi-Chao has 
gone to his fathers and ancient China 
Weeps as it still follows the dead Sun

oo 


Yat Sen. Hell and War protest but 
freedom fights.—And don’t forget that 
triumph of Nordic supremacy and of 
Negro disfranchisement, the impeach- 
ment of Governor Henry Johnston of 
Oklahoma and his lady Secretary.—The 
Judicial bench in the United States 
calls for cleansing not only in New 
York. Our courts are our greatest 
democratic failure-—Help, Hoover, for 
Haiti! The scandal of silence and inac- 
tion stinks to Heaven.—The minimum 
Health and Decency budget of the 
United States Department of Labor 
calls, for a family of five, for $2,200 a 
year; with $680 for food, $238 for 
clothes, $482 for rent, $83 for light 
and heat. $34 for furniture and $650 
for “‘miscellaneous.”’ No, Negroes, this 
is not a joke; it means that 75% of 
you are not expected to be either heal- 
thy or decent.—If crime could be 
stopped by law we'd be angels. Yet 
the crime war consists of more laws.— 
‘The war between France and the 
United States over goods, films and

story of a white girl’s adventures 
“Beyond the Color Line’; the pa- 
per on the “Negro Citizen” read 
before the National Interracial 
Conference; an essay by Allison 
Davis, “Savage or Serene’, and 
other matters. In future numbers 
we promise a paper by William 
English Walling on “The Found-

Physician”; and an essay by C. T. 
Andrews, the friend of Gandhi.

reparations goes fiercely and politely 
on.—Bigger banks, higher stock gam- 
bling, wider railways mergers, Hail 
Columbia, Happy land !—Hoover says: 

“Our whole system of self-govern- 
ment will crumble either if officials 
elect what laws they will enforce or 
citizens elect what laws they will sup- 
port. The worst evil of disregard for 
some law is that it destroys respect for 
all law.” 

He refers to the Fifteenth Amend- 
ment plus three—All honor to Karl 
Schurz, born 100 years ago, who ad- 
vocated and defended the 15th Amend- 
ment.—We got a Quaker for Presi- 
dent and a colored person for Vice 
President. All is quiet along the Poto- 
mac.—Doctor Straton has had J. 
Frank Morris, a murderer, preach for 
him and tell us about the Unpardon- 
able Sin: “Thou Shalt Not Kill.”— 
Mexico is in revolution. So is the 
United States.—The courts are making 
laws fast, handing money to the rail- 
roads, establishing telephone and street 
car rates, stopping strikes, and attend- 
ing to other matters which our elective 
officers must not touch—And now 
comes the International Bank and a 
real monarchy of nations.

‘6s HITE people are mean and | 

hate ’em,” Anna told Judge 
Maker Wright, in the juvenile court, 
“I don’t care if Dr. Robinson does say 
I'm white. I’m black and shall always 
be black. I hate you, too.” 

The question of whether Anna is 
colored or white, came up after the 
little girl of ten years, who had always 
lived with a colored family and be- 
lieved herself colored in spite of her 
fair skin and light hair, had followed 
a carnival company from. Eighth and 
State Streets to Cudahy, where police 
found her and sent her to the detention 
house. 

“Why J like you.” 

“Yes, that’s cause you don’t know 
me, ! reckon. Wait till you know I’m 
a nigger, then you'll hate me, just like 
all the kids at school hate me. I know. 
They liked me at first, too, used to give 
me apples, put their arms around me, 
choose me for a partner till—till,” she 
choked a little, but soon regained her 
fighting control, ‘““—till some of ’em 
saw me with my ma and pa.” 

“Now, now—let’s quiet down and 
not frighten all these people out of the 
room. Even Mr. Copper here is al- 
most ready to drop his billy and run,” 
the judge said teasingly. ‘‘But what 
about vour ma and pa the kids don’t 
like? If they are like you I’d like 
them.” 

“That's just it, they are ’zackly like 
me, only the kids don’t think so. They 
only see ma and pa’s skin. They call 
us ‘nigger’ and now ’stead of giving 
me apples they throw stones at me, 
'stead of puttin’ their arms around me 
they push me off the side walk, and 
‘stead of wantin’ me for a_ partner, 
they don’t want me in the ring. I 
know what it means to be colored— 
even if my skin is white and I'd 
d'rather be a ‘nigger’ than be one of 
vou cruel white people. You are all 
mean and I despise you.” 


HIS was quite a long speech for 
Anna to make in public. She had 
said the same things many, many times 
to herself, as she lingered after school, 
waiting for the rest to ‘get gone’. 

Judge Maket Wright, a young man 
of thirty-six, rather enjoyed talking to 
this little spit-fire; and the more she 
said she hated him the more he knew 
he liked her. 

“Tell me where you live I will take 
you there,” he said. 

“I know where I live and I can go 
there myself, if you'll let me,’ she 
answered, 

The judge wanted to know for rea-

Here is the interesting story of 
a little white girl who wanted to 
be black and the judge in the chil- 
dren's Court decided to let her 
have her wish. 











sons of his own. He insisted. ‘Tell 
me, won’t you, as nearly as you can, 
about yourself, Anna?” 

Anna straightened up, trying not 
to be afraid, set her eyes on the strange 
man, and began: 

“1 don’t know where I was born. 
The first thing 1 remember was a 
whippin’ they gave me at the orphan- 
age for tyin’ a handkerchief around a 
clothes-pin to make a doll. I wanted 
somethin’ that would love me and that 
| could love and tell my secrets to at 
night when I went to bed. ‘They said 
| had been snooping; that’s how I got 
the clothes pin, they said. ‘They 
wouldn’t believe me when I said | 
found it under the clothes line where 















































one of the big girls had dropped it 
while hangin’ up the clothes. They

A Congressional Campaign 


By EDWARD A. JOHNSON 


HE late campaign for Congress in 
the ‘Twenty-first Congressional 
District of New York, was very inter- 
esting and to a certain extent satisfac- 
tory to me, in that it demonstrated 
what can be done when the full 
strength of the colored voters of the 
district is exerted. While we had a 
much larger vote of registered voters 
than ever before, yet the full strength 
of the colored vote did not come out. 
We increased the vote from approxi- 
mately 23,000 to 41,000 and in the col- 
ored election districts the colored candi- 
date won on an average of 6 and 8 
to 1 and actually carried some of the 
white districts; in fact the white candi- 
dates in the white districts fared about 
the same under the Democratic on- 
slaught as the colored candidate, 
Hoover and Ottinger, candidate for 
Governor, included. While we regis- 
tered and voted many more than were 
ever registered and voted before in the 
colored districts, yet the Democrats 
registered and voted many more than 
were ever registered and voted before 
in the white districts. In one district, 
the 23rd Assembly District of our Con- 
gress District, there was approximately 
53,000 white voters registered and 
about 70% of these were Democrats. 
Too much can not be said in praise 
of those who were enlisted as workers 
in this Congressional contest. ‘They 
were certainly earnest and conscien- 
tious,—in some instances making as 
many as five and six visits in efforts 
to get out individual voters. I be- 
lieve that if we had had a few more 
days for registration, many more names 
would have been secured, as the en- 
thusiasm grew so great during the last 
day of registration that many were 
turned away. Some because there were 
not facilities for registering them and 
others because the matter had been put 
off until the last day, and the registra- 
tion booth had to be closed and they 
were thus barred out. 

The 21st Congressional District has 
had an estimated population of about 
550,000 inhabitants, nearly enough for 
three districts under the Constitution, 
and much larger than any of the other 
districts in this state. I was well 
aware on entering the contest that the 
Democratic vote had exceeded the Re- 
publican vote in the district on an aver- 
age of 5,000 to 8,000 for several years 
past. I understood this perfectly well. 
My hope therefore in going into the 
fight was to get enough of our group 
registered to overcome the usual ma-

Congressman in Illinois has over- 
shadowed the excellent campaign 
in New York by Edward A. 


Johnson. 


jority obtained by the white Demo- 
cratic candidate, and with this in view 
I spent with my forces, some 350 ac- 
tive workers, about ten days making a 
street to street, house to house, apart- 
ment to apartment canvass of the in- 
habitants of the colored part of the 
district; and our records from the sur- 
vey made show that we found some- 
thing like 60,000 inhabitants who were 
eligible and who pledged themselves to 
register during the week of registra- 
tion. All of these did not register 
however, and we are persuaded to be- 
lieve that some were negligent, as 
above stated, some indifferent, some, 
hailing from states where these quali- 
fications prevail, considered the sup- 
posed poll tax and property qualifica- 
tions a barrier and some hesitated on 
account of the literacy test. About 
95% of those that did register, voted. 

My purpose in entering the cam- 
paign was two-fold, first, to obtain 
for our group a membership in Con- 
gress, which I believe to be highly bene- 
ficial as indicating our appreciation of 
the elective franchise, regardless of 
whether any active measure relating 
especially to our group might be pro- 
posed and carried through. Second, I 
feel that the fact that our group regis- 
ters and votes in large numbers will 
make us more potential in the political 
and civic affairs of the country. This 
is a political country. Politicians make 
the laws and politicians are clothed 
with the power of enforcing the laws 
and the group or groups of individ- 
uals who do not vote do not loom 
largely in the estimation of the poli- 
tician, who very naturally turns his 
attention to the group or groups of in- 
dividuals who can help him. 


We are seriously in need of more 
political and civic consideration in this 
country and we can get it to some ex- 
tent by appealing to the courts and to 
the conscience of those entrusted with 
power, but I believe we have a stronger 
appeal in our political and voting ca- 
pacity, which if exercised properly and 
to its fullest extent will help to lighten 
our burdens as members of the Ameri- 
can population,—I can not say as mem- 


bers of the American citizenship, for 
as things now stand in many places we 
are only citizens in name, citizens for 
the performance of the duties of citj- 
zens, but not citizens for the full en- 
joyments of the rights of citizens. Our 
idea is that the strongest appeal we 
can make, and the greatest force we 
can exert, is along the line of politics, 

There are three ways by which we 
as a group in this country may lose 
the benefits of the elective franchise: 
first, we may be disfranchised by 
tricks and manipulations of others: 
second, we may neglect to register and 
vote; and third, we may put our heads 
in a political yoke and vote like so 
many dumb driven cattle. 

We, in the last analysis, should 
register and vote in large numbers but 
vote with the purpose and intelligence 
that will bring help and power to our 
endeavors to achieve our full mead of 
the benefits that accrue, or should>ac- 
crue, from the citizenship under the 
fundamentally democratic institutions 
of this country. 

I believe that in the large centers of 
population of our group, we should 
urge our people to register and vote. 
In many places they might be seriously 
needed in city, state and _ presidential 
elections to swing the election one way 
or the other, and we could align our- 
selves with the group that holds out 
the most hope for aid in the solution 
of our problems. This mode of group 
action appears to be necessary as we 
may be able to create or take advan- 
tage of a political exigency from time 
to time which might prove highly bene- 
ficial. We certainly gain nothing by 
not voting and it may be worth our 
while to try the voting remedy for a 
change. The ballot was conferred 
upon us to be used as a weapon of de- 
fense, equally arming us like other citi- 
zens in the battle for equal rights and 
it behooves us to use this weapon to 
the fullest extent. 


The following is a table of votes a 
cast in the different assembly districts 
within the 21st Congressional District. 
The 21st Congressional District in 
cludes all that section of Manhattan 
Island north of 125th Street between

ORISIS 


Countee Cullen to His Friends 


Paris, January 18, 1929. 

Dear Friends: You to whom I have 
owed letters so long; certainly it is an 
inspired editor who suggests a series 
of open correspondence to you as a 
means of retaining a friendship that has 
perhaps begun to wane under ill-treat- 
ment. ‘Tactfully the editor adds that 
what I say may at scattered intervals 
interest you... 1 am not psychologist 
enough to attempt an interpretation of 
the soul of Europe, nor physician 
enough to diagnose its maladies for 
comparison with American ailments; 
for it is only the scientific mind that 
js discriminating enough not to mea- 
sure by its own temperament the mores 
of a foreign people. Europe with 
America for its yardstick may be dis- 
appointing, but Europe measured in its 
own terms is like an inspirational tonic 
.... Thinking back with no attempt 
at an orderly survey, this new life at 
first assumes the aspect of a kaleido- 
scopic view of cities: Le Havre, Paris, 
Marseilles, Algiers, Berlin, Vienna, 
Etaples, Geneva, and again Paris. The 
memory of each city is illumined by 
some incident or series of happenings, 
mostly personal, some trivial, but each 
a guarded souvenir . Le Havre 
unique because it marked the Seven 
League Boot stride from continent to 
continent; a seaport town, rife with 
sailors and scurrying, perspiring tour- 
ists, a town with which to pass the 
time of day but not to engage in 
lengthy conversation; a town to re- 
member for an exhibition of American- 
ism overseas: the three ladies were 
evidently of German extraction, for 
the two elderly ones seemed to find it 
less of an effort to converse in that 
language than in a broken English. 
The youngest, however, a woman 
about forty, had been thoroughly 
Americanized and it pained her ter- 
ribly to use her ancestral tongue even 
when conversing with her mother. 
Poor, excited lady; she had misplaced 
her baggage, or rather an irresponsible 
porter had misplaced it for her; and 
the boat train was about to leave for 
Paris. The lady knew no French; it 
never occurred to her that perhaps her 
train companions might be able to 
stumble through a sentence or two. 
Therefore she attempted to make the 
train conductor understand English by 
bawling it into his ear very loud and 
very fast. When this novel method 


of teaching a foreign language in one 
lesson failed, she remarked with real 
feeling and disgust, “Why I thought 
everybody over here spoke two lan- 


guages.” The conductor surely spoke 
French and it is not past belief that

he may have been well versed in Chin- 
ese. But to the Lords of the Earth 
two languages mean your own and 
English . ... Then Paris en route to 
Algiers. It was July 13th; tomorrow 
Paris would celebrate her Independence 
Day and the Fall of the Bastille. We 
must stay over for the parade. We 
had missed it two years ago, and we 
hankered for a sight of the strapping 
black French colonial who, we had 
been told, led the parade with twirling 
baton, glistening face, and the gayest 
of martial strides. But, alas, though 
in Paris, we fell asleep as New York- 
ers; consequently we arose at eleven to 
view a parade that had already passed 
at nine... . Then off to Algiers by 
way of Marseilles to rest there for a 
day or two in the hope of meeting and 
exchanging a word with - Claude 
McKay, but he was too deep in the 
beauties of Seville to get to Marseilles 
before we sailed for Algiers . . . .Al- 
giers, a deceptive hussy of a town, a 
sort of whited sepulchre. beautiful 
with its white, sunkindled roofs glimp- 
sed from the deck of a slowly incoming 
steamer, but squalid and sickly under 
closer inspection . . . . Berlin, an or- 
derly, clean, regimented city, as if on 
dress parade; the Germans shaped for 
joviality but in the main serious- 
meined. Remembered incidents: Crab- 
soup at Kempinsky’s; a chance en- 
counter on the street with the Marcus 
Garveys; a similar encounter with J. 
Francis Mores, a former luminary of 
the old Lafayette Stock Company. He 
played Valentine when we saw our first 
opera; it was Faust and given by the 
Lafayette Players, and Abbie Mitchell 
was a heavenly voiced Marguerite. 
Drinking coffee in a Berlin cafe and 
suddenly hearing the strains of “No- 
body Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen” 
being softly wafted to us from a dis- 
tant corner of the room; looking up 
gratefully to see the pianist watching 
us, his expression conveying the wish 
to make a stranger welcome with some 
remembrance from his own people... . 
Vienna, where we were shown about 


by a group of socialist friends who dis- 
played with pride the city govern- 
ment’s efforts to meet the housing needs 
of a highly impoverished people. Co- 
operative apartment houses that cov- 
ered blocks and squares; simple, un- 
pretentious dwellings of little beauty, 
but built for endurance and service. 
‘‘We have no money,” our friends ex- 
plained, “for ornamentation. We must 
expend all for utility.” We visited 
one of the apartments, a one-room, 
kitchenette and bathroom arrangement 
for which the occupant pays less than 
one dollar per week. Vienna and the 
Socialist watchword: Freundschaft . . . 
Etaples a southern summer village in 
France noted for at least one luminous 
distinction as being the summer home 
of Henry Ossawa Tanner. “And did 
you once see Shelley plain?’ We have 
slept in Tanner’s house, have watched 
him cut and mix salad at his table, sea- 
soning it with the meticulousness of 
the conscientous artist; and we have 
witnessed in him one more instance 
that the coming of years and the ac- 
cumulation of honors need not dull a 
man’s human sympathies and his wit, 
nor make him unduly vexed at young- 
sters who stand in his studio and ask 
him witless questions about his easel 
and his oils. A drive with Tanner to 
Paris Plage and to Le Touquet of the 
famous Casino where evening regalia 
is required for permission to enter and 
stake your money on little red and 
black balls. But gaming tables are 
not for poor poets; a peep into the halls 
of chance must suffice... . Geneva and 
a happy week there as the guest of the 
Quaker Hostel, all arranged through 
Mabel Byrd formerly of the Brooklyn 
and New York Y. W. C. A.’s.... 
international gatherings where every 
conceivable race and country were rep- 
resented; the air shot through with 
intense hopes and prophecies for world 
peace, the brotherhood of the races, the 
millenium. And always and every- 
where a keen interest in the Negro, in 
many instances a livelier knowledge of 
what he is doing than is found in his 
own purlieus . Geneva and a 
mountain drive on a brisk October 
morning; the summit reached, and 
fronting one in the distance the cold, 
austere, majesty of Mount Blanc, a 
moment to remember as long as the 
mind can remember beauty. Leaving 
Geneva with a sort of welcoming fare- 
well ringing in our ears, “Come back 
to Geneva and read your new poems 
to us when they are finished . .. .” 
Then Paris again, and well, 
needs another letter.

The Original George Harris 


By MRS. JOHN P. GREEN 











All who have seen “Uncle Tom's 
Cabin” on the stage and in the 
recent picture, not to mention 
those who have read Harriet 
Beecher Stowe’s immortal book, 
know about George Harris. This 
is the true story of his prototype. 


girl living with my parents, the MLit- 
chells, in Oberlin, Ohio. 

The story, “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”, 
was a true story of the life of George 
Clark and his wife, Eliza, escaping to 
Canada where his wife some time after- 


ward died. Mr. Clark gave to Harriet 
Beecher Stowe the story of his life and 
other material for the writing of her 
book. 

Mr. Clark married the second time, 
and of this marriage, five children were 
born—Cyrus, Mattie, Minnie, Lewis 
and Jimmie. They were brought af- 
terward to Oberlin to attend school. 
The youngest at that time was about 
three or four years of age. Mr. Clark 
was of medium size, light of com- 
plexion, had gray hair and wore a 
short beard. He always dressed in a 
“Prince Albert” coat and appeared 
quite like a gentleman. He made his 
living mostly by lecturing and he would 
be away from home quite often. 

Mrs. Clark died of tuberculosis and 
the children were often left alone. The 
older ones were compelled to do the 
housework and look after the smaller 
children of the family. Once Mr. 
Clark went away and was gone this 
time longer than ever before. Uncle 
John and Aunt Laura, relatives who

Was a poet, another a social worker, 
still another is headed for the bench. 
One of the young girls was chosen 
secretary of the American delegation. 

I liked their frankness, their forth- 
rightness, their modesty. When they 
had their say in Commission meetings, 
they wasted no words, and what they 
said, is not forgotten. 

Their impromptu program of opera 
and spirituals shines brightly too, in 
the “afterglow”. More deeply, how- 
ever, than even the glow of the Paris- 





lived just outside the cit) limits, 
were very poor, and Uncle John was jn 
poor health. On account of Mr. 
Clark remaining away so long, the 
Uncle and Aunt were forced to look 
after these children who were in need 
and without anything to eat. Uncle 
John, having this extra burden placed 
upon him, disappeared, and nothing 
was heard of him until ~ about 
two weeks later when his body was 
found hanging to a tree. He had com- 
mitted suicide. I shall never forget the 
excitement that the news caused. The 
real suffering and the poverty of this 
family became known at this time, and 
the good people of Oberlin went to 
their aid and supplied them with food 
and other necessities. Mir. Clark ap- 
peared on the scene soon after that, 

After these children grew up. they 
left Oberlin. The two girls became 
school teachers. One afterwards mar- 
ried and lived in Kentucky where Mr. 
Clark died; the other married and lived 
in Indianapolis. Lewis was mail 
carrier and was married to an aunt of 
Clarence Cameron White, violinist and 
composer, and died about four years 
ago. Jimmie, when last heard ot, was 
living on a farm near Cleveland, Ohio. 

On returning home after 
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin’, 1 happened to 
remember that I knew Mr. Clark; 
and all these facts that I have just re- 
lated, came back to my mind afresh. 
My sister, Mrs. Nellie I. Smith, of 
Wilberforce, Ohio, was intimately ac- 
quainted with the oldest members of 
the family. I do not believe there are 
many people now who can sas that 
they knew Mr. George Clark.

THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 


ta 
A= 
A CITY VIOLATES LAW 
ACE prejudice produces strange 
events. None stranger than the 
deliberate, knowing violation of the 
law of the land by the Board of Alder- 
men and the Mayor of the capital city 
of Virginia, Richmond. 

Be it said that in this particular in- 
stance the city officers did not have 
the undivided support of the best ele- 
ments in the citizenship. And news- 
paper editors were outspoken in their 
condemnation. 

The contest arose over an issue well 
known to all intelligent people inter- 
ested in the problems of race relations. 
The issue was that of residential segre- 
vation. As is well known, the United 
States Supreme Court, by its decision 
of 1917, procured by the N. A. A. C. 
P. in the celebrated Louisville Segre- 
gation case, held that any city or state 
enactment establishing segregated resi- 
dential areas for white and colored peo- 
ple, is unconstitutional. 

That decision was upheld two years 
and reafirmed by the Supreme 
Court in a segregation case originating 
in Louisiana, and carried by the N. A. 
A. C. P. to the highest tribunal. 

In face of these two clear, unmis- 


ago, 


takable pronouncements by the court 
of highest jurisdiction in the United 
States, the Aldermen of the City of 
Richmond undertook to enact a segre- 
This ac- 
tion on their part was as plainly a vio- 
lation of the spirit of law, though not 
a punishable violation, as any trespass 
which sends lesser offenders to jail. 
The Board of Aldermen of Rich- 
mond were severely criticised for what 
they proposed to do. Yet they insisted 
upon passing the unlawful ordinance. 
When this ordinance was to come 
before the Mayor of Richmond, J. 
Fulmer Bright, the N. A. A. C. P. 
called his attention by telegraph to the 
decisions of the United States Supreme 
Court and urged him to save not only 
the face but the money of the city of 
Richmond by vetoing this ordinance 
when it should come before him. In 
its telegram the N. A. A. C. P. served 
notice plainly that it would carry this 
case to court, and of the outcome of 
such a contest there could be no doubt 
whatsoever, in view of the precedent 
decisions by the Supreme Court. 
What did the Mayor of Virginia’s 
capital city reply to the N. A. A. C. 
P? Did he concede what is obvious 
to anyone not an imbecile, that the 


gation ordinance in that city.

Nominations Asked 
For Spingarn Medal 

The highest honor bestowed an- 
nually upon an American citizen 
of African descent, awaits further 
nominations. The N. A. A. C. P. 
announces that further nominations 
for the award of the medal this 
year are invited. The medal will 
be presented in Cleveland this 
June, at the 20th Annual Confer- 
ence of the N. A. A. C. P. Nomi- 
nations should be addressed to 
Bishop John Hurst, Chairman 
Spingarn Medal Award Commit- 
tee, N. A. A. C. P., 69 Fifth Ave- 
nue, New York City. Nomina- 
tions should name the specific 
achievement or lifework on the 
basis of which the award is recom- 
mended, and should be accompanied 
by brief life history of the nomi- 
nee. 


city of Richmond had no right to pass 
such an ordinance, knowing it was un- 
constitutional? Did he give assurance 
that he would veto this unlawful at- 
tempt by the Aldermen of Richmond 
to defy the edict of the United States 
Supreme Court? Not a bit of it. 
Mayor J. Fulmer Bright, of Rich- 
mond, telegraphed as follows to the 
Nu the dae ak. 

“The racial segregation ordinance 
will be approved by this office. - The 
ordinance is drawn in the best inter- 
est of both races. Those who oppose 
it are entirely within their rights in 
having the courts pass upon its con- 
stitutionality.” 

‘To this telegram the N. A. A. C. P. 
had no choice but to reply that: 
“Slight exercise of intelligence on the 
part of Richmond’s municipal govern- 
ment would have revealed to it that 
courts have already held such ordi- 
nances unconstitutional and enactment 
of same is flouting of fundamental law 
of land as laid down by United States 
Supreme Court.” 

The N. A. A. C. P. is going to help 
fight this case. And, if, as is quite pos- 
sible, the case has to be carried as far 
as the Supreme Court it will be won. 

That is not the significant part of 
this event. The significant fact is, that 
despite the clear ruling of the Supreme 
Court in 1917, this is one of a series 
of attempts to flout and evade that 
ruling. 

It emphasizes that the fight for the 


me 


Negro’s common citizenship and hu- 
man prerogatives, is not one merely of 
getting a principle affirmed and then 
sitting by with hands folded. After 
the principle has been affirmed, it has 
to be defended against ceaseless attack. 
‘There is not a buttress of the rights of 
minority groups in America, which is 
not constantly being attacked. In the 
case of the post-Civil War amendments 
to the Constitution, the attack takes 
the form of ignoring or evading them. 
In the case of court decisions upon 
laws, the attempt is made to enact the 
same law in such a form that it can 
be made to stand. 

Or else, as in the present instance, a 
law or ordinance plainly illegal, is 
enacted, either in stupid defiance to the 
courts, or else in the sneaking hope 
that colored people and their friends 
will become tired and eventually let 
the contest go by default. 

If there is one thing that is empha- 
sized by such an act as the passing and 
the signing of the ordinance in Rich- 
mond, it is that in this struggle, for the 
present at least, there is no such thing 
as being tired. There is no such thing 
as assuming that a right affirmed is a 
right won for good and all. Unless 
there is someone or a group of people 
vigilant and ready at all times to de- 
fend these hard-won rights, they will 
eventually go in the discard. 


HIS Richmond case emphasizes for 

the thousandth time, the function 
of the N. A. A. C. P. Those who in- 
sist that, living in New York or Chi- 
cago or Los Angeles, they have nothing 
to fear from the conditions which make 
Mississippi or Alabama unbearable, 
must pause in face of this segregation 
spirit. Segregation in residence areas 
is something which, if not checked 
might spread to northern as well as 
southern cities. Once established it 
would take root in such a way that it 
would be difficult if not impossible to 
destroy. 

And in the train of segregation, as 
everyone knows, come most of the evils 
inhering in the maladjustment of white 
and colored racial groups. 

No one individual can fight all these 
cases as they arise. Often it is more 
even than the people in any one city 
can do, to fight their own local battles. 
That is where the National Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People steps in. It marshals the power

a‘ France any one caught by an April 
fool trick is called an April “fish”. 
One explanation of this is given as fol- 
lows, “April fish would be young fish” 
and for this reason easily caught, as 
were you and I on the first of April! 

April itself is brimful of surprises. 
But the birds that fly back north seem 
courageously ready to meet all changes. 
The chickadee that with the tufted tit- 
mouse and the glad song sparrow and 
the noiseless nuthatch has been around 
all winter gets a surprisingly senti- 
mental tune for spring. 

“Now, what new bird is that?” I 
wondered little thinking the first time 
I heard chickadee’s spring tune of the 
tiny mole colored bird with the jaunty 
black skull cap. 

The bustling dry winter call, 
‘‘Chickadee-dee-dee”, had been changed 
to two_ bell like notes as you and I 
change in spring from felt to straw 
hats. Chickadee is never highly musi- 
cal at best. But he wants people to 
know that there’s a great deal of sun- 
shine in his heart at all times. 

“*Whatever the weather may

“Whatever the weather may be.’

Recently over the waters “our” ship

myths from West Africa that are quite 
different from anything we have ever

Tabby 


HE silver spaniel, Argentnose, had 

nothing in the world against 
Tabby, the cat. But she thought so. 
So she humped her back into a terrible 
pyramid, glared at him and left the 
porch where Argent was trotting about 
with his toenails scratching the floor. 
She went under a cypress tree and 
gapped. Then stretched out for a

Argentnose 


nap. The cypress tree was somber 
enough with dark green foliage and 
shadowed trunk. And Tabby had a 
silent resting place in that lonely shade. 

“Cypress Cat.” This was startlingly 
called through the air. 

Tabby looked up, tweaking her 
whiskers inquiringly. Saw nothing. 
Yet there had been those words spoken 
by some one. 

“What is a Cypress Cat?” 
seemed to ask the air. 

“Nothing mysterious.” The light 
wind answering perhaps. “It’s of 
course a tabby, a striped cat. And 
that’s all.” 

“T’ve never heard of such before in 
my life,”” Tabby appeared to imply as 
she sank again to the ground, adjust- 
ing her tail like a cycle around her. 
Burying her head against one shoulder 
she arranged to sleep but again seemed 
to hear, 

“Cypress Cat!” 

She jumped up and went to the old 
cypress tree trunk and began scratch- 
ing the bark as though sharpening her 
nails. She must have torn loose se- 
crets from the gray tree. This, for 
instance, seemed to come from some- 
where to her ready ears, 

“True cypress, a shapely tree formed 
like the gold light of a taper, is a na- 
tive of the ripe old East. But I am 
American cypress. Fine old houses 


Tabby 


built of my wood stand as monuments 
in the old town of Charleston, me- 
morials to the adroit craftsmanship of 
black slave builders and to the dur- 
ability of cypress. 

“Cypress of the old world, centuries 
ago, was fashioned into massive tables, 
and musical instruments and ponderous 
beams for banquet halls. Eastern cy- 
press no more heeds the passing of cen- 
turies than October notes the flight of 
thistle seed. Mummy caskets were 
made of cypress wood. Gods, even 
Jupiter, were carved by the ancients 
from cypress. Romans and Greeks re- 
garded the foliage as sacred to the 
dead. Cypress has long been held a 
symbol of the dead. Should you go to 
Turkey you will learn that a cypress 
tree is planted for every burial, more 
or less.” 

Tabby continued 
scratch the old tree. 

“You have heard of the beautiful lad 
beloved by Helios, sun god, or Apollo, 
and by him turned into a great cypress 
that he might mourn on indefinitely.” 

“Cypress Cat!’ Here the story of 
the tree was interrupted by this fa- 
miliar cry. 

Tabby turned quickly to follow the 
voice and found the owner at last!— 
an old woman in a triangular shawl 
that reached to her belt. She had been 
gathering ferns with a small trowel. 

“Cypress Cat,” the old woman re- 
peated kindly and stroked Tabby till 
the cat again humped her back, this 
time in joy. “I’m an old person from 
old Norfolk way over the ocean. 
That’s where they call such cats as you 
Cypress Cats. Will you go back with 
me if I should go?” 

Tabby purred loudly for consent. 
She hated the thought of Argentnose, 
the new silver spaniel at her home. 
And so she went with the old woman 
from Norfolk up, up into the forest, 
Tabby a little light spot against her 
indigo skirt. And for a small part of 
the way the cypress tree’s shadow 
spread a path for them. Then they 
were gone beyond the pied gold hill.

AM a white woman married to a 

colored man. I am not the only 
white woman with a dark lover, but 
only one of several who openly pro- 
claim it. 

A great deal of inter-racial sex ex- 
perience goes on, but most of it is sub- 
rosa, and I have become convinced that 
the painfully self-conscious Anglo- 
Saxons are only too anxious to find this 
way of escape from themselves and 
their arid civilization. Since they have 
so magre an emotional approach to 
life, they envy the dark man his. For, 
in spite of the terrible social and eco- 
nomic pressure brought to bear upon 
him, he manages to elude us and live 
his own life after all. 

You may think that by ignoring and 
despising him, you have made him of 
no account. But you have only lib- 
erated him to go about his own busi- 
ness, which is hardly imitating you. 

In denying yourself all human and 
social contacts with dark folk, you 
willfully close the door on a world 
that you badly need, to leaven your 
dull lump of respectability. 

And why all this hysteria about the 
dark man, anyhow? 


Shall I tell you the cause of most 
of it? A fear that should you mingle 
with, and get to know him really well, 
you might end by loving and under- 
standing him—you might eventually 
find it hard to live without his com- 
panionship. 


E are rapidly approaching a 

white twilight. The winter of 
the Anglo-Saxon race draws near. But 
since we refuse to believe in anything 
but our own supremacy, it will take us 
by surprise. 

The ominous uneasiness of Asia does 
not penetrate our consciousness. In- 
dia is a country in which men think in 
unison; they have established a na- 
tional rhythm. Great Britain is cer- 
tainly disturbed by it. So the dark 
man in America is rapidly developing 
a race rhythm—a race consciousness. 
Think of that day when the several 
million dark men in the United States, 
realize their tremendous concerted 
power... “And the keeper of the 
gate shall tremble!” 

Recently, the Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People held 
its National Convention in Los An- 
geles. The press of the city practically 
ignored the gathering, although from 
the platform spoke most of the brilliant 
leaders of the race.

April, 1929 


Dark Lover 


By RHEBA CAIN 


This story is on a forbidden sub- 
ject. It is something we all talk 
about and yet we object to seeing 


it treated in public print. The au- 
thor, a white woman, has married 
a colored man, and she talks about 
her inexplicable act quite frankly. 





ing and found out what your dark 
brother was doing. But no, you pre- 
ferred to remain at home and read 
Octavius Roy Cohen. That cultivated 
cosmopolitan, Doctor Du Bois, made 
a startling address. He has no illu- 
sions about the white man’s civiliza- 
tion, and he minced no words in 
describing it. The super-Babbits who 
were sent as representatives from the 
white race, occupying the platform, 
came to patronize, and sat open- 
mouthed thru the brilliant and most 
unusual address of this sophisticated 
dark man in faultless evening clothes. 


HE mayor’s address was a mas- 

terly example of how to say noth- 
ing in forty minutes and ended with 
the usual Pat and Mike story. And 
there was much he might have said 
about this race and what it has ac- 
complished in sixty-three years! But 
he chose the safe way of glittering gen- 
eralities. Or, shall we be frank and 
say, that he knew nothing of what 
the dark man is doing? Incidentally, 
there were in this large assembly of 
dark people hardly a handful of really 
black ones. The race is being so rap- 
idly transmuted that an African has 
become a rare sight. 

The Lords of Karma who run this 
government, took these dark boys from 
the mines and mills and cotton fields— 
from cleaning cuspidors and driving 
garbage wagons, put them into Uncle 
Sam’s uniform and patted them on the 
back. They were sent to France for 
cannon fodder. ‘This was a great mis- 
take. Their cheerfulness, their cour- 
age, their nonchalance under fire, won 
the admiration of the French. French 
women do not despise dark skins. In 
France, our black boys dropped their 
old inferiority complex like a worn out 
garment. They came back men who 
respected their race. 

White people no longer possess the 
power to make the dark man feel in- 
ferior, and when you cannot brow- 
beat a man, you have lost your hold on 
him forever. I agree with George 
Schuyler when he says that the white 
man has more in common with the 
dark man than with any other race. 


We have grown up side by side—some 
of us have suckled the same mammy— 
and there is little essential difference 
in our ambitions and ideals. 


ONCE asked my dark lover, in 

whose veins flows the blood of an 
African king and a Virginia aristo- 
crat, about his reactions in life. 

He laughed. 

“Where do you get that tom-tom 
stuff? My reactions are no different 
than yours. I love America. I am 
part of it. We have been able to 
throw off the shackles of slavery, but 
there is a new slavery—that of our 
mechanistic civilization — both the 
black and white suffer together in it.” 

When I think of the mistrust and 
suspicion bred in dark men by the 
white attitude, it makes me burn with 
shame. A clergyman once said to me 
that India could never be a great coun- 
try, because of her caste system. He 
completely ignored our own caste sys- 
tem, and refused to discuss it, when I 
called his attention to it. 

The one and only way to get rid of 
the race question is to forget it, to 
make opportunities for white and col- 
ored to meet and mingle freely. I can, 
thank heaven, without subjecting my 
dark friend to insult, receive them in 
our home, where they meet the friends 
of the white group, who are without 
prejudice. ° 

It is a well known fact that th 
dark men’s friends among our race are 
generally artists, writers, thinkers, hu- 
manitarians, intellectuals. Thus he 
escapes the sterility of mediocrity—the 
slime of Babbitry—and contacts a su- 
perior environment. The same thing 
exists in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where 
the Pueblo Indian mingles with the 
members of the Art Colony. 

This superior contact is breeding in 
the better class of the dark race, a crit- 
ical fastidiousness, a delightful arro- 
gance toward the average white man, 
on the part of the educated black man 
that is interesting, not to say ironic. 
Many dark men of your acquaintance 
care as little to know you as you care 
to know them. 

I may be accused of writing too pas- 
sionately upon this subject, but it is a 
subject about which one may not write 
dispassionately. One thing of which 
I am increasingly sure—the barriers 
are down. The day is fast approach- 
ing when inter-marriage will be com- 
mon, and excite little comment, and 
the best members of both races will 
welcome it.

Me 


Simon of Cyrene 
By DORA C. BARKER-KECHELY 


UR Saviour bore His heavy cross 
Along the dusty road. 
With tear-dimmed eyes and stumbling 
feet 
With broken heart and woe complete 
He fell beneath His load. 


A black man’s hand upraised the cross 
His shoulder bore the weight 
He walked beside the stricken One 
Until the weary march was done 
Nor shared the crowd’s mad hate. 


The mob’s loud jeers rang out amain 
And for His death they cried 

But the Saviour walked the weary way 

To certain death that dreadful day 
And His black friend walked beside. 


Around them swept the angel hosts 
No human eye could see 
They wept to see God’s stricken Son 
And I, too, weep, Oh Blessed One! 
For Thou hast died for me! 


Lord Jesus, hear Thy servant's prayer. 
And make me strong and clean. 

To bear the cross Thou gavest me 

Along the narrow way with Thee 
Like Simon of Cyrene. 


I Want a New God 
By FORREST O. WIGGINS 


OULD God call it sinning 
If I were to press your body 
close to mine 
And enjoy the warmth of its caress? 
Would God call it sinning 
If I were to kiss your lips 
And set my smouldering soul on fire? 


Our God is too far removed from this 
world. 

What does he know about love? 

What does he know about the sensuous 

€ delight of a lovers lips, 

‘The companionship of a kindred soul? 


I want a new god, 

A finite god—a god of human kind 
A god of life—not this god of death. 
I want a god of love 

A god of wine 


A god of joy. 


Shopping 
By ETHEL M. CAUTION 
O-DAY I went a-shopping 
And now that day is done 


Although I purchased myriad things 
With gold I paid for none. 


124 


The price I paid was ecstacy 
That seered me with its name. 
And branded me forever 

With the rapture of its flame. 


The beauty of the things I saw 

And garnered to my heart 

Have made my life an endless song. 
My soul a treasure mart. 


Grapes: Still-Life 
By ANNE SPENCER 
NUGLY you rest, sweet globes, 
Aged essence of the sun; 
Copper of the platter 
Like that you lie upon. 


Is so well your heritage 

You need feel no change 

From the ringlet of your stem 
To this bright rim’s flange; 


You green-white Niagara, 

Cool dull Nordic of your kind,— 

Does your thick meat flinch 

From these touch and press your 
rind? 


Caco, there, so close to you, 
Is the beauty of the vine; 
Stamen red and pistil black 
Thru the curving line; 


Concord, the too peaceful one 
Purpling at your side, 

All the colours of his flask 
Holding high in pride... 


This, too, is your heritage, 

You who force the plight; 

Blood and bone you turn to them 
For their root is white. 


Incident 
By ELIZABETH K. GRANT 
WALKED rapidly along Lenox Ave- 
nue, 
Hurrying to a subway station. 
I wanted to get to town and back again 
Before noon, one Saturday morning. 
But I forgot my hurry, forgot 
That I wanted to buy a hat and some 
slippers, 
For near the subway entrance was a 
blind man, 
Was he old—young? 
How can I tell you! 
His face was scared with harsh lines. 
Etched deeply by centuries of suffering; 
But his hands, large and beautiful, 
Were young, with unquenchable youth, 
Alive in every finger tip. 
And while I hesitated, drawn 
By some strange force to linger there, 
The blind man lifted his violin 
And played. 


Played softly, scarcely loud enough 

To be heard above the heavy Saturday 
traffic; 

Played a rollicking little tune, 

A tune brimming with enchantment and 
witchery, 

That caused people to pause and smile, 

And go on their way with their shoulders 
lifted, 

Conscious of the blueness of the sky, 

The fleeciness of the clouds, 

Above the rumble of that Saturday 
morning traffic. 

And then I went down, 

Down beneath the street, into the sub- 
way, 

But the subway was transformed, 

For the blind man’s music went with me, 

And I forgot the crowds and noise, 

And the impatience of the scurrying peo- 
ple, 

‘To remember instead the sky, a cloud, 

And the unquenchable youth in a blind 
man’s fingers.

By FERDINAND L. ROUSSEVE 


W E parted love, not knowing then 


How many moons would rise 
Ere we should see each other more,— 
How many suns the skies

I came and went, as in a dream, 
Before the passing leaf 

Could its autumnal splendor lose, 
Before my lasting grief 

Could spend itself in copious tears. 


The plaintive song the nightingale 
Sang soft at evenfall 

Came often on the dew-filled breeze 
In answer to the call 

My longing heart sent out to you; 


But Fate too well ordained, my love, 
That we should meet no more. 
And thus I sit at eve and pine 
Upon the mournful shore, 
A prey to sad and haunting dreams.

OUR MONTHLY SERMON 


HESE are happy days for those 

who are writing and reading Ne- 
gro literature. For a time all of us 
were a little afraid that the almost 
sudden flare of interest in Negro writ- 
ing and the desperate effort of new 
young dark writers, was a spasmodic 
thing, likely to be overdone instead of 
being the ground-swell of a great move- 
ment. 

As time goes on, all of us are be- 
coming more and more convinced that 
there is here now a movement, a great 
development, and not simply a fad. 
But this can only become assured as 
there is built up back of the new 
Negro writers a strong wide and sane 
body of readers. It does not mean 
that these readers necessarily all 
be black, but obviously the people who 


are most interested in this literature 


must form the bulk of its readers. 


It is all a matter of habit. We do 
not, as colored people, systematically 
and regularly buy books. We do sys- 
tematicallly and regularly buy dinners 
far beyond the needs of our bodies; we 
buy expensive clothes; we are going in 
for furniture and decoration, and we 
are traveling each year more and more 
widely. Against this, there is but one 
criticism ; namely: this ration must be 
balanced by book-buying. The family 
that spends $500 a vear for rent can 
surely, without strain, spend $10 a 
vear for books. If it costs $15 to at- 
tend the Odd Fellows Ball, it is quite 
possible that $10 on the Ball and $5 
on two recent books, would be a more 
profitable investment. 


LATEST LITERATURE 
om desk is filled with all sorts 
\J of things calling for attention. 
here is, for instance. the ‘Survey of 
Negro Colleges and Universities”. It 
is a volume in 20 or more chapters, 
forming Bulletin Number 7, 1928, of 
the Bureau of Education in the United 
States Department of the Interior. It 
calls for long and careful study, and 
we shall from time to time refer to it. 
Meantime, however, what a contrast 
‘his Report is from the Thomas Jesse 
Jones Report of 1916! That Report 
Was a clear and distinct endeavor to 
decry the Negro colleges, except a few 
guided by white men, and to endorse 
and advertise industrial education. 


April, 1929 


Today, the whole program of indus- 
trial education as worked out in the 
Nineties, is a confessed failure. The 
Negro college has come into its own, 
and this Report of the United States 
Government is a dignified, encourag- 
ing message which recognizes that 
Negro education is going to follow the 
same lines as all education of human 
beings. 

Among the new books that have 
come to us are “Mamba’s Daughters”, 
by Du Bose Heywood, (Doubleday, 
Doran and Company) ; “The Blacker 
the Berry”, by Wallace Thurman, 
(Macauley); “Plum Bun”, by Jessie 
Fauset, (Stokes) ; “This Side of Jor- 
dan”, by Roark Bradford, (Harpers) ; 
“The Pedro Gorino”, Captain Harry 
Deane and Sterling North, (Hough- 
ton Mifflin); .“What the Negro 
Thinks”, by Rabert R. Moton, (Dou- 
bleday, Doran and Company); “Un- 
happy India’, by Lajpat Rai; “Living 
India”, by Savel Zimand, (Long- 
mans), the “Magic Island” by W. S. 
Seabrooke, (Harcourt, Brace.) 

Of most of these we shall speak 
again. 

“The Conjure Woman”, (Hough- 
ton-Miffin Company), the earliest of 
Mr. Charles W. Chesnutt’s books, has. 
to our great delight, re-appeared in a 
new edition. Joel Spingarn writes the 
foreword and says: 

“Ir. Chesnutt’s novels, published 
over a quarter of a century ago, mark 
an era both in the history of the Negro 
and in the history of American litera- 
ture. They are the first novels in 
which an American of Negro descent 
has in any real sense portrayed the for- 
tunes of his race. Paul Laurence 
Dunbar had more or less successfully 
introduced the material in brief 
snatches of song and in brief studies 
of character and incident, but he 
failed, like other and feebler prede- 
cessors, in his attempts at a more ex- 
tended treatment in the form of a 
novel. Mr. Chesnutt is a true pio- 
neer, but we should be underestimat- 
ing his achievement if we thought of 
it merely in terms of its subject matter 
or material. Only the archaeologist is 
interested in this kind of priority: what 
is important is not that Mr. Chesnutt 
was the first to discover or deal with 
the material, but that he was the first 
to give it life.” 

We hope to see all of Mr. Ches- 


nutt’s novels in new edition. 





r 
De 
Il HAVE JUST READ 


66 AMBA’S Daughters”, by Du 

Bose Heywood, (Doubleday, 
Doran and Company), is an excellent 
hook and worth reading, but I do not 
like it. Partially, this is a subjective 
recoil at feeling the hands of strangers 
at the heart of my problem. The atti- 
tude is unfair and almost silly, and yet 
it has a certain real justification. I 
assume that the white stranger cannot 
write about black people. In nine 
cases out of ten I am right. In the 
tenth case. and Du Bose Heywood is 
the tenth case, the stranger can write 
about the colored people whom he 
knows; but those very people whom he 
knows are sometimes so strange to me, 
that I cannot for the life of me make 
them authentic. 

[ have no doubt but that Catfish 
Alley in Charleston, New Orleans and 
Galveston, breeds people like Mamba 
and Porgy. But they are in no sense 
typical American Negroes today; and 
when their story is coupled with the 
trite tale of the old Charleston white 
aristocracy, I am full of resentment. 

The story of Charleston aristocrats 
has been done to death; here it is writ- 
ten again with singular delicacy and 
understanding. But I am no longer 
interested in the way in which a small 
group of privileged people set them- 
selves at the top of the world and 
make its people their cherry. When, 
in addition to this, and as a part of 
the same story, there comes the de- 
bauchery and exploitation of the low- 
est of the black low, I again renege. 
I want the story of real, ordinary peo- 
ple, black and white. 

Of course, this criticism is unfair 
because the author was writing frankly 
of those two classes of people. And 
given his task, he did it well. He 
even reached tentatively up and 
showed how out of the mud of the alley

THE NATION 

@ During the year 1928-29. the col- 
ored Elks, through their Educational 
Department under W. C. Hueston, 
have granted scholarships to 46 stu- 
dents and will grant 5 others as soon 
as certain conditions are met. Among 
the institutions to which these students 
will go are: 5 to Howard University; 
3 to Fisk; 2 to the University of Pitts- 
burgh; 2 to Johnson C. Smith Univer- 
sity; 2 to the Uinversity of Nebraska; 
2 to the University of Kansas, and sin- 
gle students to Amherst, Drake, Vir- 
ginia State, Armour Institute, Syra- 
cuse, Bates, Ohio, and other colleges. 
@. There are in the United States at 
present eighty-four colored Catholic 
parishes, 133 Parochial schools, with 
22,000 children. There is one small 
Seminary, 5 Academies, 3 Industrial 
schools, and 11 Orphan Asylums. Over 
these institutions there are 183 priests, 
of whom all but 4 are white, and 900 
sisters, of whom 300 are colored. The 
Catholic Church is still unable or un- 
willing to educate Negro priests.

MR. HOOVER AND THE 
SOUTH 


OME of us are excited at the 
expressed determination of Mr. 


April, 19209 


Hoover and his friends to clear up po- 
litical conditions in the South. But 
the Crisis is not a bit aroused. On 
the contrary, we are smiling placidly 
and pricking our ears. The fact is 
that we have heard before of projects 
of cleaning up the South, and while 
we are always interested, we know 
usually just exactly what the reform- 
ers have in mind. 

We know that Mr. Brookhart, com- 
ing out of the guileless West, thinks 
that “Political Corruption” and 
“Negro” are synonymous terms in 
Dixie. Indeed, there is no doubt but 
that his Southern friends have assured 
him repeatedly that this is the truth. 
So long, then, as the Hoover Admin- 
istration persecutes and _prosecutes 
Negroes, there will be applause, North 
and South, for their zeal and honesty. 
The Negroes will sit in worried si- 
lence. Most respectable Negroes in 
the South, following the advice of 
Booker T. Washington a generation 
ago, have long since given up politics 
and the ballot. There remains in poli- 
tics two classes of black men, the 
grafters and the fighters. Fighters, 
like Redmond of Mississippi and 
Church of Tennessee, will be in for 
a hard time, because the white South- 
erners are determined to oust them 
and the North and West is willing, 
even though they are honest men. 

So far so good. But the difficulty 
is coming when Mr. Hoover and Mr. 
Brookhart touch the real political cor- 
ruption in the South. For if the new 
administration is sincere in this mat- 
ter, it will learn that black political 
corruption in the South is but the thin 
cover of a white cesspool. When the 
investigators reach this cesspool and 
stick to their job THe Crisis will get 
ready to be interested. 

The center of Southern political cor- 
ruption is the graft, bribery, and sale 
of public office built on the rotten 
borough system which gives every 
white politician in the South the right 
to cast, not only his own ballot, but 
the ballot of three or four other dis- 
franchised voters. Political reform in 
the South will mean nothing until this 
fundamental fact is grasped and dealt 
with by the nation. Until then, noth- 
ing is going to happen except what has 
already happened, and that is the im- 


possibility of real Democratic Govern- 
ment throughout the United States be- 
cause of this Southern corruption. 

Is Mr. Hoover really going to touch 
this subject? We doubt it. We as- 
sume that he and his advisors think 
that the political owners of the Solid 
South are already beaten and on the 
run. These leaders have received, to 
be suye, a slight setback in 1928, but 
does anyone think that is going to 
make them give up the tremendous 
power and wealth which their political 
usurpation puts in their grasp? Well, 
it will not. They realize, of course, 
that they made a mistake in the last 
election. and suffered from an unex- 
pected revolt on the part of religious 
fanatics and the Anti-saloon League. 
They will not repeat the mistake. 
Neither is there any chance that the 
fanatics will demand real democratic 
government in the South because 
that means Negro voters and Negro 
Gfice holders. As much as the Meth- 
odist Church, South, hates and fears 
liquor and Catholics, it: fears and 
hates Negroes more. The Solid South 
will remain solid, as long as this is 
true. Little theatrical adventures in 
trying to find what black man got five 
dollars from the sale of federal offices 
which netted white men thousands will 
not even begin real reform. 

Meantime, we are in receipt of an 
interesting suggestion. An_ earnest 
gentlemen writes us from Cincinnati: 

‘““As a part-time Southerner (Flor- 
idian), and worker in the Party both 
there and in Ohio, I have found, and 
political history will support me in 
this assertion, that the Republican 
Party never will get anywhere in the 
greater part of Dixie except under 
white leadership. 

“Let us accept this as a fact, regard- 
less of whether it represents an ideal 
condition, and, considering also that 
now is the most auspicious occasion in 
history for the Republican Party to 
obtain a foothold in the South if un- 
der white leadership, view the hypo- 
thetical but probable results of such 
a movement: 

“If the situation is freed of the 
complication of race prejudice, there 
gradually can be evolved in the South 
a substantial Republican Party. As it 
gains in numbers and prestige, two-

“With no party in control, it will 
be impossible to keep the Negro dis- 
franchised. It may be suggested in 
objection to that view that, with lead- 
ership in both parties intrenched, 
neither will move to permit the Negro 
to vote. As a matter of practical poli- 
tics, vou and | both are aware that, 
when power is in the balance, no party 
hesitates to reach out for every vote 
available, without questioning the color 
of the voter. 

“In other words, the cold facts of 
the matter are these: “The Negro isn’t 
getting to first base in the South, and 
can not lead the Republican Party to 
first base. The Republican Party has 
a chance to make independent progress 
there, after which the Negro may hope 
for his political emancipation. He has 
nothing to lose and everything to gain. 
Why not take the gamble?” 

This appeal leaves us unmoved. We 
have seen spiders invite flies into their 
parlors before, without any signal gain 
except to the spider.

EDUCATION 

HE next step before the National 

Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People is a forward move- 
ment all along the line to secure jus- 
tice for Negro children in the schools 
of the nation. Large numbers of Ne- 
gro children are today being raised in 
ignorance. It is difhcult to adduce re- 
liable figures because the Southern 
states and the United States Govern- 
ment refuse to reveal the facts. But it 
is not too much to say that half the 
black children of age in the 
South today have no chance to receive 
a thorough education through the 
grammar grades, and that not one- 
tenth have a high school education 
open to them. 


school 


In open defiance of the constitution 
of the United States, of congressional 
enactments, and of their own. state 
laws, the funds devoted to education 
by the states and the nation are syste- 
matically spent so as to discriminate 
against colored children and keep them 
in ignorance. Against this, a few 
states, like North Carolina, are mov- 
ing slowly. But South Carolina, 
Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and Ala- 
bama are shameless and impudent in 
their defiance of law and justice in Ne- 
gro education. “There must be a way 
to bring their cases before both state 
and federal courts. 

Other states, like Maryland, Dela- 
ware, Tennessee and Kentucky, Arkan- 
sas, Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana, 
are lagging behind in reasonable effort 
to distribute public school funds be- 
tween the races equitably. The United 
States Government is not seeking to 
compel anything like a just distribu- 
tion of Land Grant Funds or the funds 
from the Smith-Hughes and Smith- 
Lever appropriations. We have set 
down too long as silent victims of this 
discrimination. The rights of the 
American black child are in question. 
It is time to start the crusade. 


ELKHORN, WEST VIRGINIA 
| THANK you very much for the 


literature sent and your expressed 
interest in our endeavor to celebrate 
Negro History Week. 

The celebration went over “big”. 
At the daily assembly student programs 
were rendered sponsored by teachers. 
We succeeded in getting three com- 
petent Negroes to speak to us, and the 
exhibits were good. The programs 
dealt mainly with the Negro in music, 
literature, art, business and _ politics. 


The students and patrons were de- 
lighted over the exhibits and knowl- 
edge gained about our race. 


As a “project’”’ we have decided to 


raise funds for the purchase of Negro 
literature, and photographs of some of 
our leading men and women. 

You might be interested to know 
that the Elkhorn Negro High School 
has just been admitted to the National 
Honor Society for High Schools. As 
you may know, the requirements for 
membership in this society are rather 
rigid.” 


MATTHEW HENSON 
OU promised nearly a year 


6 7 
ago that you would say some- 


thing about Mathew Henson in Tue 
Crisis. This was, as you remember, 
when Emanuel Celler, Congressman 
from New York, introduced a Resolu- 
tion into Congress awarding Henson 
a Gold Medal. Congress has been 
throwing medals about to everybody 
like a woman throwing corn at her 
cacking chickens. But they buried 
Henson’s name in the deeps of the 
deep. I think we should keep to the 
fore such men’s names, when the 
whites, as you know, want to belittle 
us and our accomplishments and make 
us pariahs of the human race. Henson 
is the only living human being who has 
stood at the North Pole. You must 
agree with me that Henson’s name in 
the Aprit Crisis would be timely to 
remind us that on April 19, 1898, 
Peary and Henson stood at the Pole. 


J. ML. Boppy.” 


HERE'S A HOME 

AMI glad to say I am a reader of 
THe Crisis. It is a_ fine little 
book. As we live near Philadelphia I 
get it nearly every month. I am writ- 
ing to you to ask you to help me and 
we probably can help someone of our 
race. I own a little home in Maryland 
about 9 acres of ground and + room 
house. I am housekeeping in Pennsyl- 
vania as my husband owns his home 
here. I want to put some settled man 
and wife of my race in it to stay there, 
one who has knowledge of planting, 
raising poultry. I mean a farmer. The 
house is partly furnished. I have 
lived there myself and been very happy. 
I want to put some one there that has 
ne home who will stay there. [I am not 
charging any rent. There are apple, 
peach, and pear trees, grapes, flowers, 
in season, near station, and not far 
from A. M. E. Church or schoolhouse. 
I have an old Uncle who is staying 
there now. We will help them best 
we can to get started. Would like 2 
christian family. My daughter and I 
will run down there for a week or 99 
in summer. That is all. It is a home 
for a party who will till and raise 2

Anna 
(Continued from page 117) 


came to the Memphis Orphanage, 
came Ma and Pa Olds. They seemed 
to look at me more than any one of the 
other girls. Pretty soon old Miss 
Whip, that’s what God and I called 
her—l’ve forgot her real name—came 
to me and said these people were go- 
ing to adopt me. 

“Then I took my first ride. It was 
in a buggy behind an old horse, black 
like Pa Olds. I always liked old Jim 
—that was the horse’s name. Pa Olds 
afterwards gave Jim to me for mine. 

“We had only got started away 
from the orphanage when they spied 
something in my hand and ast what it 
was.” 

Her eyes grew a little brighter. A 
faint smile came on her face. 


“At first I wasscared. I was 
afraid if they found out they would 
take her away from me. But Ma Olds 
laughed a little, then pulled out of her 
pocket a real sure enough doll and 
handed it to me. It had a black and 
white checked skirt on it with a tur- 
key-red shawl around its shoulders, 
She said Rachel would be a good name 
for it, so I called it Rachel. But I 
never trusted Rachel like I did God. | 
only told Rachel of the good things | 
did. 


“Ma and Pa Olds used to build 
campfires in the evenings on the banks 
of the Mississip. Other nigger kids 
used to gather ’round and Pa would 
play nigger, music and tell us stories. 
‘Then”—she stopped, her face grew 
sad again,—‘‘then Ma Olds, after the 
other kids had gone home, used to tell 
me about her own little girl that she 
once had and didn’t have any more. 
And she would hug and kiss me. Pa 
Olds would pull a big red handkerchief 
out of his pocket, and wipe away tears. 
Then with his big, rough black hands 
he would stroke my hair and I would 
grab his hand and kiss it. . . . Then we 
wouldn’t talk at all for a long time.” 

“Two years ago we moved up 
North.” She slid to the edge of her 
chair and again regained her granite- 
like character. ‘Here we are in Madi- 
son—and I don’t like it and that’s all 
there is to it.” She drew a long 
breath and quit talking. 

The judge looked at the officer. The 
officer looked out of the window. 

After a long silence, the judge 
asked, “And where is—God ?” 


a thought for a minute as if 
forming her words, then she said, 
“You know, God never liked it up 
here either. The air and sunshine ain't 
the same as in the South. Even Pa 
Olds says that babies and melons don’t

seem to grow in the North like they 
do down there. We, God and me, 
talked it all over many, many times. 
Many times we played we were down 
South again. We always wanted to 
go back. I couldn’t go, I couldn’t 
leave Ma and Pa Olds, ’cause I knew 
they couldn’t get along without me. 
So I started to figure and plan how I 
could get God back to the country she 
liked. 

“One day in school I was studyin’ 
g’ography, I noticed that the Yahara 
River flowed south and south and 
south. So I ast our teacher, ‘Does that 
water go into the Mississip?’ He said 
it did. Then I ast him if it went 
passed Memphis and he said ‘Yes’. 

“That night, when I went home, I 
went to the bed-room, and got God. 
Ma and Pa told me I'd better give 
her a different name and I did—for 
them—but when we was alone [ al- 
ways called her just ‘God’. Well, we 
talked it all over. She was tickled and 
wanted to start right away. I could 
hardly give her up. But I loved her 
so I couldn’t make her stay any 
longer. I did it for her sake.... The 
last I saw of her she was floating 
south, toward the Miississip and 
Memphis.” 

Anna looked up as if to ask if there 
were any more questions. 

Again the judge looked at the off- 
cer. Again the officer looked out the 
window. ... 

After a long silence, during which 
Judge Maket Wright’s meditative 
stare seemed to take him far away, he 
said : 

“I guess she’s black, ain’t she, 
Murphy ?” 

“I think she is,” the officer gulped.

More than once | saw him talking 
earnestly to groups out under the pines, 
and there was always merriment at the 
table at which he sat. 


I can sense again the hush that fell 
upon us the night he told the Com- 
mission on Religion, the African inter- 
pretation of the Creation. And I can 
feel myself swaying once again to the 
African drum song he taught us the 
afternoon of the Negro entertainment 
in the big tent; and hear him say, 
“There can be no peace until the 
world is in harmony—until life is a 
song.” 

“God, in the beginning days.” he 
told us, in his story of the Creation, 
“was a Baker. On Creation morning 
He baked many loaves of bread and 
put them in His oven. Discovering, 
however, that His oven wasn’t quite 
full, He went back to knead more 
dough. When He opened the door 
to insert the new loaves, He was al- 
most overcome by the smoke that emit- 
ted. And He saw that the loaves 
farthest in were burned to a crisp, and 
that the loaves nearest the door were 
burned deep brown. Now, we South 
Africans”, he continued, “believe that 
the loaves most deeply burned by the 
tire of God’s Holy Spirit, symbolize 
the Negro race; those, nearest the door, 
the Malay race” and then he added 
naively, yet earnestly withal, “and the 
loaves that did not even get into the 
oven,—the white race.” We gave him 
back an answering smile, but deep in 
the heart of each of us was a new seri- 
ousness. AIr. J—— had turned our 
faces toward “The Christ of the Afri- 
can Road.” 

Artist, Poet, Student—Mr. J—— 
that entertainment afternoon in the 
big tent—was it any wonder that the 
Camp Mother gathered them about 
her, at the close of the program, and 
calling them “Dear Black Brothers” 
bade them return to Africa and to 
America, and tell their comrades that 
world youth are vitally interested in 
every move they make toward inter- 
racial, international understanding,— 
ves,—toward World Peace?

of the entire race in the country, and 
of the white friends who want justice 
done irrespective of race, in aid of any 
individual or small group hard bested. 

The N. A. A. C. P. has procured 
sweeping and important decisions from 
courts of high jurisdiction. Yet, I 
think it would be safe to say, that many 
or most of those decisions would be 
speedily evaded and nullified if the N. 
A. A. C. P. were not on hand to keep 
defending them. 








This is something to ponder for 
those who hesitate about giving to the 
Association the slender resources on 
which it has done and continues doing 
its work in behalf of colored people 
and the country in which they live.

N. B.—The N. A. A. C. P. is nowy 
engaged upon a Twentieth Anniver. 
sary campaign to raise a $200,000 Ey. 
tension Fund. 





THE TENTH CRUSADE 

In a little less than five years the 
Colored Babies, assisted by vrow n-ups, 
ot the United States have raised by 
popular contests $68,437.16 to fight 
for their own future. In 1924 they 
raised $11,000; in 1925 $20,414.90: 
in 1926 $11,758.31; in 1927 $8,333. 
58; and in 1928 $16,930.37. 

This we call “The Tenth Crusade.” 
—there were Eight Crusades in the 
Middle Ages, and in 1922 the Colored 
Women of America conducted what 
Dr. Du Bois called “The Ninth Cru- 
sade” and raised about $15,000 to 
fight lynching. Early in 1924 the 
Babies of Colored Mothers began 
“The Tenth Crusade”—and it will not 
cease,—till Colored Babies cease, o1 
until they are “born free.” 

Every Branch of the Association and 
every group interested in its work that 
has not yet had a Contest, should con- 
duct one in 1929. And Branches that 
held Contests in previous years, can 
repeat them this year. There are al- 
ways New Babies. There is still the 
handicap. 

Many Branches have held contests 
repeatedly. Los Angeles, which leads 
the whole field, held its third Baby 
Contest in 1928 and organized the first 
Baby Fraternity in the history of the 
world. Pasadena organized Chapter 
‘Two. Other chapters will follow. 

The Contest Method, either with 
Babies or with older children or grown 
people, is the least expensive and the 
most successful way for the Branch to 
raise its apportionment in a single et- 
tort of from four to six weeks time. 


Full directions can be had from the 
National Office.

Watching him I recall a sight that 
met my eyes only a few weeks ago. 
On the nineteenth of February the 
snow was falling in a business like way. 
It had started the night before and the 
little persistent flakes were building 
wonderful changes in trees and over 
meadows and highways. ‘That. after- 
noon I looked out at a field that was

and white snow. A bird flew dully 
across my view. ‘The bird was large 
and I could not discover what it was 
till it stopped on a poplar bough and 
turned a black streaked breast toward 
me. And there was a flicker! 

Seeing this happy flicker on the lawn 
reminds me of that one that was so 
miserable in the snow. For a while 
he sat humped up on the branch. But 
as children came laughing up the pike 
the bird flew off in alarm and I saw 
the gold shafts of his wing feathers. 
Soon from the hedge in the back yard 
1 heard a cry that cut to the heart. 
It was a call to humanity from a suf- 
fering bird. I hurried into the cold 
but the flicker was gone. 


Dark Lover 


(Continued from page 123) 


HERE is in Hollywood an organi- 
tion known as “The Black and 

White Club”, where sophisticates of 
both races meet and mingle socially. 
When this club was founded, the rush 
of the white people to join was astound- 
ing. They were tired of themselves, 
tired of each other. “They welcomed 
the dark people with open arms. 

Some of the inhibited Nordics were 
a littie self-conscious at first. They 
were too cordial—couldn’t take the 
dark man naturally. And sometimes 
the defense mechanism of the dark 
man showed under his evening clothes. 
But in one or two encounters, skins 
are forgotten—the novelty has worn 
off, and social ease is accomplished. 

When it was known that I pos- 
sessed the courage to openly love a 
dark man—and to be seen with him, 
everywhere it was possible—l was 
amused, not to say astonished, to find 
how many of my white friends ex- 
pressed a desire to share my experi- 
ence, and later, openly courted it. 

So—it will soon be the fashion in 
Hollywood to have a dark lover. You 
may have this indignantly denied, but 
please bear in mind that denial and 
indignation are in themselves, suspi- 
cion. On the other hand, you are 
likely to receive letters begging for my 
address, from readers who wish to be- 
come eligible for The Black and White 
Club. I have written a book called 
Dark Lover. I have made it into a 
play. I shall find a publisher for the 
book, and a producer for the play. 
You will read the book, and attend the 
play, sharing vicariously the thrill of 
my dark lover. 

My dark lover smiles at my 
naiveté. He says I take him too seri- 
ously. I think, perhaps, he is right.

No doubt the gesture is superfluous. 
I braved ostracism for my dark lover, 
and I discovered there was no ostra- 
cism. He was not only accepted by 
my friends, but welcomed by our 
group, and was at once entirely and 
un-selfconsciously at home. 

Moreover, he does not think I have 
bestowed a great gift upon him, be- 
cause | am white, and we take each 
other as naturally as other people do. 
When we have differences, they are 
never racial—only temperamental 
and find us, when restored to normal, 
always meeting on the common ground 
of mutual respect, mutual passion and 
mutual affection.

do not doubt the existence of the de- 
bauched tenth, but I cannot regard 
them as characteristic or typical, and 
while there is a certain tang and un- 
usualness to their adventures, enough 
of their sort is as good as a feast, and 
God knows we have surely latterly 
had the feast! 

“Plum Bun” is a work of sincerity 
and finish and of extraordinary human 
interest. It will not attract those 
looking simply for the filth in Negro 
life, but it will attract and hold those 
looking for the truth. It is a story of 
a little colored family in Philadelphia 
with two daughters, one brown, and 
the other able to pass for white. The 
novel is the story of her “passing”; of 
the depths and heights to which it led, 
and of the sanity which it finally 
evolves. The characters are drawn 
surely and clearly and the plot is easy 
and natural. 


PERIODICALS 


E have received a file of the 

extraordinarily interesting “Oed- 
aya’, published in Holland, edited by 
Noto Soeroto, and dealing most inter- 
estingly with the race problems of the 
Dutch, particularly the Javanese and 
the Guianians. 

The first number of Volume Two 
of Africa, journal of the International 
Institute of African Languages and 
Cultures, comes to us. It is edited by 
Diedrich Westermann. The trend of 
the first volume is kept up. The slo- 
gan is always “‘Educate Africans as 
Africans and not as Europeans’’, which 
in its practical application means to 
keep the Negro from acquiring mod- 
ern education. Outside of this, the 
Quarterly tends to follow the lines of 
German scientific periodicals. Monroe 
N. Work is the only American Negro 
that has appeared in its pages. 

It is singular how we tend to for- 
get the obviously good and _ indispen- 
sable. Here is the Journal of Negro

History edited by Carter G. Wood- 
son, entering its 14th year of life. It 
keeps up its solid worth. scientific ac- 
curacy, and careful editing. Recent 
numbers have contained articles on the 
“Mandate System in Africa”, the 
“Mohammedan slave trade’, the ““Ne- 
gro in the Pacific Northwest ’, and the 
Annual Report of the Director. 

The January number of the /nter- 
national Review of Missions, pub- 
lished in London, is a special double 
Number, with a Report of the Jeru- 
salem meeting of the International 
Missionary Council. ‘The conclusion 
of the Council’s “Survey on Africa” 
says: —— 

“The increasing recognition in some 
parts of Africa of the right of Africans 
to participate in government, seen, for 
example, in the Native Council of 
Transkei and the elected membership 
of the legislative councils in parts of 
West Africa, is in contrast to the racial 
animosity seen in other parts, which 
inevitably effects both legislation and 
administration. Inadequate provision 
for African education, forced labour 
and other forms of exploitation. still 
exist.”

sic. Metfessel and 
University of North 
Press. 

HIS is an interesting attempt 
made possible by a grant of the 

Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial 

to photograph Negro songs. 

“This group of songs constitutes the 
first sustained effort to preserve selec- 
tions from a particular type of folk 
music by the method of phonophotog- 
raphy. The camera has been substi- 
tuted for the conventional phonograph, 
and scientific notation has been substi- 
tuted for the conventional musical no- 
tation. 

“In this age of extraordinary spread 
of civilization into the remotest parts 
of the earth, primitive folk traits are 
being obliterated and lost at an amaz- 
ing pace. Shall we preserve the na- 
tive songs of our Indians, our Negroes, 
our Hawaiians, our Filipinos? Shall 
the scientific collection of the songs of 
the most primitive peoples be taken 
seriously, together with other anthro- 
pological collecting? Let us hope that 
the present trial of instruments and 
methods of collecting songs in the field 
May arouse investigators to a recogni- 
tion of the great value of this type of 
collections and the necessity of doing it 
at an early date, unless we shall for- 
ever lose the opportunity of recording 
permanently some of the most interest- 
Ing expressions of folk life which are 


now being wiped out by the march of 
civilization,”

@ The National Association of Col- 
legiate Deans and Registrars held its 
Fourth Annual meeting at Prairie 
View State College, Texas, March 7th 
to 9th. In 1826, twenty colleges were 
represented at the meeting of the As- 


sociation; thirty-six in 1927; and 
forty-one last year. 
@ The Reverend Mathew Christ- 


man, $.V.D.. who opened the first 
colored Catholic High School and the 
first colored Seminary in the United 
States, is dead in St. Louis, Missis- 
sippi. He was only 42 years of age. 

@ There is a proposal to merge New 
Orleans University, Straight College, 
and the Flint Hospital, all of New Or- 
leans, in one large Negro university. 
@ S. D. Redmond, Chairman of the 


Mississippi Republican Committee and 


chief protagonist against the Lily 
Whites, was disbarred by Judge 
Strycker. Mr. Redmond has appealed 


the case which arose out of the hand- 
ling of an estate and his alleged con- 
nections with Federal patronage. The 
charges against his son, a college and 
law graduate from Harvard, were dis- 
missed. The Judge in charging the 
jury said: “TI commend and congrat- 
ulate the illustrious and gray-haired 
father of one of the leading Counsel 
for the defense in this case and the 
confederate veterans who were mem- 
bers of the Constitutional Convention 
of 1890, by whose noble effort this 
question of Niggers participating in 
politics has been settled and set at rest. 
Niggers in politics, handling Federal 
patronage, what do you think of that, 
Gentlemen? What are we coming 
to? This must be stopped.” Strycker 
is a Judge who once fined certain in- 
surance companies $8,000,000, and 
nearly every fire insurance company 
left the state.

instrumental in this new departure.

the number of colonial enterprises de- 
mands native labor to so great an ex- 
tent that moral responsibilities are not 
kept up with. The demand for labor 
is destroving the family and native or- 
ganization, diminishing the birth rate, 
increasing infant mortality, and ob- 
structing education. By its prodigal- 
ity in granting concessions, the Gov- 
ernment is forced to an exaggerated 
compulsion in order to promote the in- 
dispensible native labor. Natives are 


brought “often unwillingly to the 
camps and yards”’. 
At their Stanleyville meeting ™ 


July, the Bishops considered it their 
duty to make this protest. ; 
@ England has various methods ot 
supressing native leadership. Herbert 
Macauley is the leader of the Demo 
cratic Party in Nigeria which controls 
nine-tenths of the votes for the elective 
members of the governing council. Be 
cause of a statement in a native papel 
which the officials interpreted as incit 
ing to riot, Mr. Macauley, on the eve 
of the election was sentenced to SX 
months’ imprisonment without option 
of a fine. Even government officials

EAST AFRICA 

q The Collar of the Annunziata, 
which is the highest and most exclus- 
ive Italian order, has been bestowed 
upon Ras ‘Tafari, Negus of Abyssinia. 
This black man thus has the right to 
call himself Cousin of the King of 
Italy. 

q The London Morning Post reports 
that after the visit of Ras Tafari of 
Abyssinia to Europe in 1924, he re- 
turned full of enthusiasm for progress 
and reform, but met with much hos- 
tility, on account of the sums of money 
spent on his tour and his foreign alli- 
ances. Last vear a sudden eftort was 
made to overthrow him when _ the 
Empress Zaudita sent her guards to 
arrest him; but he was ready and prac- 
tically made her a prisoner with nom- 
inal rank, while he was crowned as 
Negus or King. He is slowly going 
ahead with his innovations, bringing in 
motor cars, building roads, using elec- 
tric lights, and establishing a_ police 
force at the Capitol. For some time, 
at his own expense, he has been send- 
ing young Abyssinians to be educated 
in Europe and America. Recently, he 
has determined to establish an interna- 
tional wireless station at Addis Ababa. 


SOUTH AFRICA 

@ A Manifesto of the I. C. U. de- 
clares that the coming election in 
South Africa will have little interest 
for the majority of our people because 
they are voteless. but “we are looking 
forward to the day when the native 
peoples will take their rightful share 
in the election of the government of 
the country.” 
@ The 5th Annual Conference of the 
Cape Native Voters Association was 
held at Queenstown, South Africa, 
December 17-19. The Reverend a 
Mdolomba was President. They pro- 
tested against the threat to deprive 
them of the ballot which they had ex- 
ercised since 1854. Since then, the 
Proposal has failed by a two-third ma- 
jority in the Union of South Africa 
Parliament and will become one of the 
chief issues in the coming electoral 
campaign. 
@ The International Congress of 
Tropical Medicine has been sitting in 
Cairo. They laid the foundation stone 
of a new hospital and medical school. 
€ On December 6, 1928, a new code 
for native labor in Portuguese colonies 
Was officially published. It deals with 
the recruiting of natives, labor con- 
tracts, wages, clothing, etc. It marks 
an advance on former legislation, but 
is still more theoretical than practical.

the Belgian Congo, excluding Ruanda- 
Urundi, is 8,121,194. It is estimated 
that over a million natives were not 
counted in the census. In Ruanda- 
Urundi, it is estimated there are 5,000,- 
000 other native people, so that the 
total black population under the Bel- 
gian flog is between fourteen and fif- 
teen millions. 

WEST INDIES 
@ Emanuel A. Lazare of Trinidad, 
B. W. I., a devoted leader of the 
blacks, is dead. 
@ Miss Sophy Redmond is a medical 
student at the colored medieal school 
at Paramaribo, Dutch Guiana. She is 
the first colored girl to enter that col- 
lege. Miss E. Rysel is a government 
certificated milliner. 
@ Napoleon B. Marshall for six years 
attached to the United States Consul- 
ate at Port-au-Prince, Haiti, has re- 
turned to the United States. He seri- 
ously indicts the American occupation. 
@ The first Conference of representa- 
tives of the legislatures of all British 
West Indian colonies, British Guiana 
and the Bermudas, has been held at 
Bridgetown, Barbadoes. The func- 
tions of the Conference are advisory 
only, but the question of tariffs was 
discussed, the development of agricul- 
ture, migration, and education. 
@ There are at this time five colored 
Americans in the Executive Depart- 
ment of the Panama Canal, serving as 
Secretaries of the five colored commun- 
ity clubhouses. The salaries of these 
men range from $1872.00 to $2250.00 
per year. Salaries of white men hold- 
ing similar positions doing similar 
work, are much higher than those of 
colored men. ‘The colored, however, 
receive the same consideration in most 
other ways, such as vacation allow- 
ances, commissary privileges, rentals, 
and other employees’ reductions. The 
work in many respects, is similar to 
that of the Y. M. C. A. in the States. 
The appointments to these positions are 
made through the Panama Canal Of- 
fice at Washington. 

The names of the present incum- 

bents, and their homes in the States are 
as follows: J. E. Waller, Philadel- 
phia, Pa.; A. G. Neely, Pittsburgh, 
Pa.; J. E. Moore, Texas; Herbert 
Bradley, Philadelphia, Pa.; H. C. Wil- 
liams, Philadelphia, Pa. 
@ There has been organized in Colon, 
under the laws of the Republic of 
Panama, “The Atlantic Building Syn- 
dicate”, capitalized at $50,000.00 with 
Mr. L. A. De Veaux, one of the out- 
standing financiers and business men of 
the country, as President. The syndi- 
cate is composed of all Negroes, mostly 
of the West Indies. This company is 
engaged in handling all kinds of real 
estate, loans, mortgages, etc.
