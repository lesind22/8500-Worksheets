| The wide awake race citizens in these centers are giving 
| this company a liberal share of their insurance patronage, 
and thus are the recipients of the two-fold service which 
this company offers its policyholders; namely, personal 
protection when disabled by sickness or accident, and a 
death claim after death, also dignified and profitable em- 
ployment to worthy race men and women, which means 
an elevation of race people in the economic scale of life. 


































Without this superior insurance contract which, for one 
small premium provides protection against disability and 











death, and which also makes it possible for worthy race 





boys and girls to have employment, your insurance needs 
have not been met.

GREATEST NEGRO BUSINESS ENTERPRISE 


PEALIE 


comes first 


66 SOUND mind in a sound body” was hailed 
by the ancient Romans as the greatest of 


all possessions. And, after several thou- 



























sand years, the world still agrees with them. 









But while the Romans considered health a gift be- 





stowed by chance, a lucky favor of the gods, we have 








learned that it is the result of keeping a few very simple, 








but immutable, laws. We have learned, too, that the 











health of the individual is not his concern only, nor his 








family’s concern only, but the concern of the entire 
community. And our more modern way of considering 
health has brought about organized public health ser- 


vices as important factors in government. 


It is certainly to our individual advantage to coop- 
erate with the community in its work for the good of 
all. Knowing that loss of bealth may mean loss of ev- 
erything good in life it is emphatically our concern to 





know the simple laws of health and to observe them. 














As a part of its service to its policyholders and prospec- 
tive policyholders, this Company has prepared a booklet 
briefly outlining the fundamental rules of health (which 
are chiefly applied common sense) together with some 
discussion of the modern viewpoint upon sickness and 
accident and their treatment. This booklet is in no 
sense intended to take the place of your physician. It 
contains no remedies, advocates no cures. But some of 
the information it contains, compiled from authoritative 
modern sources, may aid in the prevention that is better 


than cure. It is yours for the asking, without obligation.

burg, Anne Spencer’s Garden—The 
world that loves peace is infinitely in- 
debted to the Russian Soviet Govern-

ists’ chestnuts out of the fire by fight- 
ing with poor distracted China.—lf 
Thomas Edison knew as much about 
human nature as he does about elec- 
tricity, he would not attempt to dis- 
cover genius and morality by a series 
of cheap catch questions—We are 
deeply curious to know just what val- 
uable and heroic traits of nature are 
proven by having two gentlemen sit 
for long periods up in the air to trans- 
fer gasoline and send silly messages to 
the newspapers—Mr. LaGuardia, 
Republican candidate for Mayor of 
New York, sneers at Negro rulers in 
Haiti. Mr. Jimmy Walker, Demo- 
cratic candidate for the same job, ob- 
jects to Negroes in ball rooms; and 
there you are.—After a time the re- 
peated revolt of tens of thousands of 
convicts all over the country may bring

cruelty of the thing that we call pun- 
ishment of crime.—It has been finally 
decided that the Vestris sank not be- 
cause the Negro crew was unmanage- 
able, but because the white owners lied 
and cheated. As though we did not 
know this before——Gastonia may be 
the beginning of an interesting end; 
for a long time white Southern work- 
men have been taught that there is but 
one evil on earth and that is black 
Southern workmen. They are gradu- 
ally discovering that white Southern 
employers may sometimes find it to 
their advantage to lynch whites as well 
as blacks.—One of these days Eng- 
land is going to find out why her white 
laborers are idle; and that is because 
black laborers throughout the empire 
are doing their work for twelve cents 
a day.—The United States is feeling 
important and chesty. It has collected 
its pound of flesh from France and 
sent Poincaré home to die. This 
shows what shrewd and philanthropic

THE Crisis 















The Papaloi 


A Story by ANNICE CALLAND 


HE topaz fire of full sun was upon 
the royal palms and red flowered 
poinciana trees, waiting, waiting in the 
silence of the summer moon of the year 
1912 in Haiti. 

Leconte, the President was uneasy 
among his palace guards for a revolu- 
tion was brewing. And though the 
President was uneasy among his guards, 
a white woman traveled alone through 
the Black Republic. Traveled with but 
one purpose in mind, to save her son 
from a shameful death, or to die with 
him for he was all that was left to her 
in this world. 

She had heard of an old and wise 
Papaloi, a native of Haiti. She had been 
told that if any one on the Island could 
help her, it would be Soulouque, the 
Papaloi. 

Arriving at the dark jalousied store 
building in the Rue de Dessalines, she 
entered without hesitation and inquired 
of the silent footed attendant who came 
to meet her for Soulouque. Beckoning 
her to follow, he conducted her through 
the dark cluttered curio store room, 
through another room richly furnished 
and softly lighted through half closed 
jalousies, and pulling aside heavy cur- 
tains of rich tapestry, he bowed her in- 
to a room hung with priceless silks and 
furnished in costly woods. Before her, 
seated at a massive mahogany desk was 
a scholarly looking gentleman in rich 
robes. Soulouque was not black. Ac- 
cording to the painstaking classifications 
of Moreau de St. Méry, he was a mara- 
bout, that is to say he was eighty parts 
black and forty-eight parts white. 

Soulouque looked up; before him 
stood a lady more delicately beautiful 
than a La France rose tree in full 
bloom. 

Soulouque desired all beautiful wo- 
men, all women sleek and beautiful; 
above all women Soulouque desired this 
beautiful white woman. 

“Your wish, Madame?” he inquired 
in French, bowing courteously to her. 

Her eyes glowed with subdued fire as 
she answered him: 

“My son is a prisoner. He is ac- 
cused of having plotted against the 
Haitian Government. He is to be ex- 
ecuted in the morning for a crime of 
which he is as innocent as you or I. 

Since there is no escape for him, we 
would die together. I endeavored to 
smuggle a dagger to him, but the 
guards searched me and found it. He 
is being subjected to such indignities 
of which you may know much more 
than I. But he can tell nothing of the 
revolution because he knows nothing. 


September, 





1929 





“At your suggestion I have en- 
deavored to put this West India 
legend in prose, but I fear that 
you will find my prose not as 
good as my poetry even. 

“IT hope that you will not con- 
demn Soulouque until you have 


read through to the end. It was 
the ending that attracted me most 
as told by the lady of whom I 
have written you. It being well 
known that she was a Maman- 
loi, the story could have no other 
ending.” 


I have heard that you have a knowl- 
edge of many native drugs and of 
poisons; and have come to you for a 
poison that can be carried past those 
who will search me.” 

“That would be a pity, a very great 
pity,” said Soulouque; and fell to mus- 
ing. 

No one knew Port au Prince as 
Soulouque knew it. He had seen les 
blancs come and he had seen les blancs 
go, driven away by petty persecutions. 
He had seen them absorbed by the 
Blacks. He had seen many of those de- 
stroyed who would not be driven away 
and who would not be absorbed. 
Soulouque pondered. He knew the 
lady and her son were exiles who had 
fled from Russia in the year 1906. 
They had gone first to Paris; from 
Paris the son had come to Port au 
Prince, and promoted a company for 
buying and selling the coffee which 
grew with so little cultivation on this 
sun-washed Island. He had succeeded ; 
better, perhaps for him had he failed. 
Now he was a prisoner, and a beautiful 
white woman had come to Soulouque. 

Soulouque sighed. 

“That would be a pity, a very great 
pity,” again said he, then continued: 

“T will give you a poison; it will be 
in asmall silver tube that you can carry 
under your tongue without inconveni- 
ence; but,” Souloque hesitated and fell 

to musing again, “after you have given 
the poison to your son, you must return 
here. You will tell him that you, too, 
will partake of the poison at a certain 
hour, but you must return here.” 

As Soulouque spoke he drew back a 
heavy tapestry that concealed a door 
which he opened and motioned the lady 
to enter. No one passing on the mean 
and dirty streets in front of Soulouque’s 
curio shop could possibly guess the 
beauty of the room disclosed. Rugs of 
beauteous Oriental pile in delicate and 





harmonious colors covered the floor. 
Pottery and porcelains of quaint and 
curious designs were about. Tapestries 
covered the walls, tapestries of Chinese 
textiles of gold and silk woven in 
elaborate patterns, gorgeous pieces of 
textile art of the richest decorative ef- 
fect. And books, books, old and 
strange, that at a happier time she 
would have joyed to read and handle. 

Soulouque offered her a chair and 
she sat down, looking at him expectant- 
ly. It was plain that she had not com- 
prehended and was waiting for him to 
explain more fully. A servant brought 
tea and curious little confections, serv- 
ing her daintily. 

Soulouque left the room for a few 
minutes and returned with two tiny sil- 
ver tubes, which he explained, con- 
tained the deadly poison. One tube was 
for her son, the other for herself; both 
could be carried easily in her mouth at 
the same time, and were so sealed there 
was no possible danger to the person 
who carried them. 

“This afternoon you will go to your 
son at the prison; as you kiss him good- 
by for the last time you will pass him 
one of these tubes. You may tell him 
that you will swallow the contents of 
the other tube at the same hour. Then 
you will return to this room—and to 
me. 

Slowly, slowly, Soulouque’s meaning 
came to her. Her dark eyes widened 
in horror and she shuddered. Her face 
could be no paler after death. Her lips 
trembled when she tried to speak; her 
mouth opened and closed but no words 
came; it seemed that she had lost the 
power of speech. One thought only 
came to her over and over: 

For her son’s sake; to end his unen- 
durable sufferings; for his dear sake; 
to save him from torture and shame; 
that he might die in peace. Steadily 
she looked at Soulouque for a moment. 

“T will return,” she said, and held 
out her hand for the poison. Soulouque 
gave it to her and silently held open 
the door for her, bowing gravely as she 
left the room. 

Down the sun-filled, sleepy street 
she passed. Beggars showed her their 
sores, some smiling ingratiatingly, 
others threatening her if she did not 
give them a sing cob; but she did not 
see them. Two long lines of market 
women passed continuously, baskets 
poised upon their heads, driving patient 
bouriques, their paniers piled so high 
with market produce that the tiny ani- 
mals were scarcely visible, chattering

OST of the facts in the follow- 
ing article are known to the 


public. The comment and reactions, 
however, have been partially concealed. 
For the sake of historical accuracy, 
and to the astonishment of our des- 
cendants, we are publishing the fol- 
lowing article. 


THE Facts 


Mrs. Oscar DePriest was a teacher 
of music before she was married. The 
DePriests have been married thirty- 
two years and have had two children: 
One son was drowned; the second, is 
married, and has a son. 


Mrs. Hoover, the wife of the Presi- 
dent, had been giving a series of teas 
to the wives of the members of both 
Houses of Congress during the extra 
session. She asked Mrs. DePriest by 
formal written invitation to attend a 
tea, at which were present the wives 
of the Secretary of War and the At- 
torney General, the niece of a Senator 
from Ohio, and the wives of Repre- 
sentatives from Pennsylvania, Indiana 
and Ohio. Mrs. DePriest said after- 


ward: “I met a group of charming 
ladies. It was a most delightful after- 
noon.” 


These are the facts and they have 
been disputed only in one case: The 
Tampa, Florida, Life declares that 
Mrs. DePriest “was never invited.” 
That the affair was “informal and on 
the lawn,” and that Mrs. DePriest 
“remained at the outer edge of the 
gathering where Negro servants were 
present. . . . She was not recognized 
by Mrs. Hoover or any of the ladies 
present on a social plane with the 
guests.” This is, of course, a lie out 
of whole cloth similar to the apocryphal 
stories of Booker Washington’s din- 
ner, and done for Southern consump- 
tion, It is but one illustration of the 
extraordinary reaction which this tea 
has had over the country. 

Two incidents followed the tea: 
The National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People held a 
ppblic musicale in Washington, to 
which Mr. DePriest invited his fel- 
low Congressmen. At Cleveland dur- 
ing the annual meeting of the National 
Association, Mr. DePriest made some 
plain statements concerning the situ- 
ation: he called the white Southerners 
“cowards and hypocrites”; he declared 
that he would take every right of a 
Congressman from the Congressional 
Barber shop to tea at the White 
House; and that he would vote no ap- 
propriation to enforce the 18th 
Anmendment until something was done 


to enforce the 14th and 15th.

Mrs. DePriest Drinks Tea 


THE REACTIONS 

Let us now note the reaction of the 
nation. 

First, certain prominent Southern- 
ers hasten to comment on the tea: Pat 
Harrison called the incident “as de- 
plorable as it is astounding!” Sena- 
tor Sheppard of Texas regarded the 
tea as “a step fraught with infinite 
danger to our white civilization.” 
Congressman Green of Florida de- 
clared that ‘“‘the social consciousness” 
of Americans was outraged, and 
promised not to attend any social func- 
tions at the White House or dine at 
the Congressional restaurant. -Senator 
Siffifaons of North Carolina, who sup- 
portéd Hoover, regarded the affair as 


“exceedingly unfortunate,” while Sen- 


ator Overman, his colleague, said it 
was a “great blow to the social stabil- 
ity of the South.” 

Bishop DuBose of the Methodist 
Church, South, thinks the tea “has de- 
liberately wrecked the fairest chance 
that has come to the nation in the past 
one hundred years.” 

Several Southern legislatures which 
were in session immediately took up 
the matter. The Florida House of 
Representatives declared the entertain- 
ing of Mrs. DePriest “both shameful 
and disgraceful, and if persisted in, 
will destroy the prestige of the Anglo- 
Saxon race.” The Mississippi legisla- 
ture condemned “unreservedly the tea 
as tending to destroy racial in- 
tegrity.” Texas passed a resolution 
which the Governor signed explaining 
that he disapproved the tea but would 
not criticize Mrs. Hoover. 


For the most part, the incident was 
seized upon by the regular Democrats 
of the South as proof that the Solid 
South could not be broken and that it 
was a mistake for Southerners to vote 
for Hoover. The Milan, Ga., News, 
likes “Hoover better than we thought 
we possibly could. We like him be- 
cause he is the kind of President we 
suspected he would be. The social 
equality kind. And while we are not 
pleased with social equality, we en- 
dorse it for a Republican President. 
It is the thing that more nearly than 
anything else insures Southern 
democracy.” The Winona, Miss., 
Times declared “this unfortunate in- 
cident will lose the Republican Party 
hundreds of thousands of votes that it 
had corralled during the last Presi- 
dential campaign.”” The Dothan, Ala., 
Eagle declared that Hoover “has no 
real regard for the feelings of South- 
ern people,” and that “The Republican 


Party has always sought to antagonize 
rather than cultivate the friendship of 
the people below the Potomac.” The 
Roanoke, Va., Times says “that the tea 
and resulting talk is going to cost the 
Republican Party thousands of votes 
in Virginia in November and in other 
states next year.” The Danville, Vir- 
ginia, Bee calls upon Southern Demo- 
crats to settle minor differences, “and 
by their ballot cast in united strength, 
rebuke at the first opportunity a Re- 
publican administration which is spon- 
soring DePriest.” The Birmingham 
Age-Herald says: “It will no longer 
be possible for the Hoovercrats to 
pooh-pooh the race issue.” The Mac- 
clenny, Fla., Reporter calls the Hoover 
Democrat now a hybrid animal, “to 
be treated as our other hybrid, the 
mule—just ignored.”” The Opp, Ala., 
News says: “The social venture of 
the First Lady of the nation having 2 
Negro woman as her guest in the 
White House, looks ugly enough to 
we Southern people (sic) but if the 
mere social feature was all there was 
to it the matter wouldn’t be half as 
grave as it is. Other and graver mat- 
ters are sure to follow, however, for 
it is difficult enough at best to keep 
feelings between the races good here in 
the South. With such example as the 
recent White House tea, the problem 
becomes far more serious and ap- 
proaches an_ impossibility.” The 
Concord, N. C., Tribune complains 
that Hoover “failed to name a South- 
erner to his cabinet; he likewise over- 
looked the Southern states when he 
named his Farm Board; he has enter- 
tained a Negro at the White House.” 
It concludes that he has “‘no hopes of 
carrying the South again.” 

A few Northern papers touch this 
political aspect. ‘The Hartford Cour- 
ant says: “the uncompromising §atti- 
tude of Bishop Cannon and his friends 
have caused many Southern Democrats 
to feel that the transfer of political 
allegiance that was registered in No- 
vember may become permanent. To 
these, the opportunity offered by the 
issue of ‘social equality’ to escape the 
penalties of their regularity and to re- 
store the fortunes of the Democratic 
Party in the South is irresistible. In 
view of this low political activity, the 
attitude of President and Mrs. Hoover 
is doubly commendable. They have 
not sacrificed principal for expediency. 


‘ The Providence Tribune adds: 
One prejudice is set against another 
prejudice. It is enough to make de- 
cent, intelligent, fair-minded and hon- 


orable people hang their heads in shame 
for their fellow countrymen.”

Certain Southern papers go beyond 
this purely political phase: they pro- 
fess to see a deep plot: The Raleigh, 
N. C., Times declared that DePriest 
gets his “cue” from the White House, 
and that the Hoovers are desperately 
trying to revive the subsiding prejudice 
against the South as the supposed op- 
pressor of the Negro race. The Tus- 
caloosa, Ala., Journal regards the tea 
as an opportunity for “incidentally and 
adroitly testing public sentiment with- 
out seeming to make it of fundamental 
importance.” 

Numbers of Southern people and 
leaders agree that the effect will be to 
harm and threaten the Negro. The 
Wilmington, N. C. Star declares that 
DePriest’s speech has done more harm 
to the Negro race “than any ten men 
in the last century.” The Double 
Springs, Ala., Herald thinks the tea 
will “tend to create false hopes in their 
black breasts,” and will revive the Ku 
Klux Klan. The Pembroke, Ga., 
Enterprise looks forward to  inter- 
marriage and rape: “If a vicious Negro 
happens to reason that if a Negro wo- 
man is good enough to be entertained 
by the wife of the President, he is 
good enough to enter your home and 
pay court to your white daughters, 
and you voted for Hoover, the old 
adage of ‘chickens coming home to 
roost’ will stand up on its hind legs 
and look you squarely between the 
eyes. 

“Tf the next twelve months were to 
record a criminal assault on the per- 
sons of a hundred white girls, or 
even one, by Negro brutes, by reason 
of being emboldened by the unfortu- 
nate indiscretion of Mrs. Hoover, the 
white woman who voted for her hus- 
band can shoulder their share of the 
responsibility.” 

The Carnesville, Ga., Herald says: 
“When a Negro decides that he is on 
an equality with the white man, then 
he will not only seek the white man’s 
daughter in marriage, he will seek to 
supplant him in every conceivable place 
and time.” 

The Monroe, Ga., Tribune says 
“that the tea has done more to disturb 
telations between the white and black 
races “than anything that has occurred 
during the past twenty-five years.” 

The Durham, N. C., Herald says 
that DePriest “has done more to set- 
back the efforts of the better thinking 
men and women of both races . . . 
than anything else in this generation.” 
He has almost “undone the fine prog- 
ress that has been made.” 

The Cordele, Ga., Dispatch is even 
wilder: “Utterances like that of De- 
Priest, if continued, will eventually 
mean racial destruction—at least, in 
this section of the country. That Negro 
may keep up his agitation until every 


September, 1929 


black man and woman and child would 
be driven out and suffer untold hard- 
ships and privation. Lawful slavery— 
if it should ever exist again—would be 
a paradise as compared with the suffer- 
ing that would be heaped upon every 
black man if the DePriests were al- 
lowed to continue dispensing racial ar- 
senic. The whole power of the armies 
of the nation could not prevent it. 
White men would die resenting it— 
shed the last drop of blood extermina- 
ting such Negroes as DePriest.”’ 


Several Southern papers take oc- 
casion to reiterate the “fairness” of the 
South. The Memphis Commercial A p- 
peal, for instance, says “that Negroes 
are lynched for the same crimes that 
white people are lynched,” and that 
there “is no law in the statutes of any 
Southern state limiting the franchise 
of the Negro which does not apply 
equally to the white man.” 

The Dalton, Ga., Citizen says: “The 
South is treating the Negro fairly. He 
owns his property. He goes to school 
at the state’s expense. He votes when 
he qualifies.” 

Other papers just as flatly con- 
tradict this and see in the whole 
tea and talk a challenge to the nullifi- 
cation of the 14th and 15th Amend- 
ments and a comparison with the 18th. 
Northern papers like the Minneapolis 
Evening Tribune say: “We can’t pick 
and choose the votes that we should 
revere, and if the South wants the 18th 
Amendment obeyed, it must accept the 
14th and 15th.” 

The Syracuse Post Standard says: 
“The Constitution should be obeyed, 
although the South does not propose 
that it should be obeyed.” 

On the other hand, the Birmingham 
Age-Herald retorts that “those who 
voted for Hoover were told last year 
that trouble might be expected with re- 
gard to the 14th and 15th amendments 
if Mr. Hoover won. That trouble has 
come.” 

The Nashville Tennessean declares 
the 14th and 15th Amendments “As a 
matter of fact, were never adopted by 
the necessary number of free and sov- 
ereign states. Their ratification was 
forced upon a helpless people by Negro 
and alien legislators sustained by fed- 
eral bayonets. They were inspired in 
hate and born of a malicious purpose 
to wreck revenge upon the people of 
the South.” ~ 

The Tampa, Fla. Tribune says: 
“The election of DePriest and the 
recognition according him has done 
more to destroy friendly relations be- 
tween the races than all the good work 
in that direction has accomplished in 50 
years. It was bad enough to elect any 
kind of Negro to Congress; but when 
the one elected is of the loud-mouthed, 


braggart type of DePriest, it is in- 
tolerable.” 

The Jackson, Fla., Blue Shirt (the 
organ of the “white working class’’) 
talks plain English about the Negro 
vote: 

“You might as well make up your 

mind that the niggers are not going to 
vote in the South and there are more 
ways than one to stop them and don’t 
worry, we will stop them. When you 
try to encourage your race by trying to 
raise $200,000, you are just encourag- 
ing bloodshed and if you want to see 
your race wiped out in the South just 
keep up your work. The fight is com- 
ing in the South and there is no use of 
us playing the ostrich by hiding our 
heads in the sand, a race war is com- 
ing sure and I don’t want my people to 
be caught unprepared and I hereby ad- 
vise every white man to look up that old 
musket or that old rifle or even that 
old rusty revolver, and get it cleaned 
up. 
The Tampa, Fla., Times adds: “Be- 
tween DePriest and Tinkham, this 
business is not through yet. There is 
probability of much trouble over social 
equality between the races and over 
the 13th, 14th, 15th and 18th Amend- 
ments to the constitution and their en- 
forcement.” 


The attitude of Mrs. Hoover is not 
without defense even in the South. 

The Bristol Tennessean says: “There 
is no more justification for the exclu- 
sion of a black man and his wife from 
such a function than there is to exclude 
a red, yellow, brown or white one.” 

Coleman Hill, columnist in the Ma- 
con, Ga. Telegraph writes: 

“How Mrs. Hoover’s action can in- 
fluence the future courses of private 
hosts and hostesses, I am absolutely un- 
able to see. No law compels Mrs. Van- 
derbilt to invite the janitor of the 
Trinity church to her next supper; nor 
is the Idle Hour Club forced to accept 
Phil Towns or Lee Battle into mem- 
bership. Mrs. Hoover did the gentle, 
the gracious, the courteous thing. In- 
stead of glorying in her deed, the 
brotherhood of Southern political para- 
sites has taken occasion to bow its heads 
—I quote the typical resolution of the 
Texas legislature—‘in shame and re- 
gret’.” 

One Southern Bishop, W. N. Ains- 
worth, has expressed similar sentiments. 

The northern press is either para- 
lyzed into silence or speaks like the 
Springfield Republican: ‘“The Hoovers 
function in the White House as the 
official symbols of government and gov- 
ernment in this country cannot turn a 
blind eye on Negroes. Negroes cannot 
be eliminated, ignored or nullified. 
They are here to stay. The Hoovers

VERY year between 25 and 50 

thousand American Negroes meet 
in a great series of assemblies 
stretched from the Atlantic to the Pa- 
cific for all sorts of purposes. This 
movement is so far-reaching that 
there is danger of its being literally 
forgotten as something so universally 
known as not to be regarded as news. 
Yet these meetings serve many great 
purposes. First of all they are a bond 
of unity and personal acquaintanceship 
between members of the Negro race 
living widely scattered in a more or 
less inhospitable environment. Sec- 
ondly they are steps toward united and 
co-operative action in many ways and 
their power is growing and developing 
along certain specific lines. 

The meetings can roughly be divided 
into educational meetings, religious re- 
unions, meetings of professional men 
and fraternal organizations, business 
and industrial meetings and gatherings 
for music and athletics. 


SCHOOLS 


There were during the past summer 
summer schools for colored teachers 
held in fifteen different states and num- 
bering 37 in all. The largest schools 
were at Tuskegee, Prairie View, 
Hampton, Tennessee State and Peters- 
burg where probably a total of 5000 
were enrolled. The other schools 
probably added at least 5000 if not 
10,000. To these must be added the 
attendance of colored teachers at the 
great northern universities during the 
summer, especially to Chicago, New 
York, Boston, Cincinnati and else- 
where. Specific teachers’ meetings in- 
cluded the Teachers in Colored Schools 
at Jackson, Miss., and a few state or- 
ganizations. 


THE NATIONAL NEGRO BUSI- 
NESS LEAGUE 


HE National Negro Business 
League met at _ Indianapolis 


August 15th to 16th in its Thirtieth 
Annual Session. The officials were R. 
«RK. Moton, President, J. L. Webb, 
First Vice-President, A. L. Lewis, 
Treasurer and A. L. Holsey, Secre- 
tary. Mr. C. C. Spaulding was Chair- 
man of the Executive Committee.

BAPTISTS 


HE two branches of the colored 
Baptists met September 4th at 
Kansas City, Mo., and Norfolk, Vir- 
ginia. The incorporated National 
Baptist Convention under the presi- 
dency of Dr. L. K. Williams had an 
attendance that ran up into the thou- 
sands. Various boards made reports 
on foreign missions, publishing, home 
missions and education. The Sunday 
School Publishing Board reported sub- 
stantial progress toward liquidation of 
the debt on the new publishing house 
at Nashville and the Foreign Mission 
Board has established a hospital in Li- 
beria. The Women’s Convention, 
Auxiliary to the main convention, met 
under the presidency of Mrs. S. W. 
Layton with Miss Nannie Burroughs 
as Corresponding Secretary. Plans 
and programs were adopted for the 
Fiftieth Anniversary of the founding 
ot the convention which will take place 
in 1930. 

The unincorporated National Baptist 
Convention with the Rev. J. E. Wood 
as President, met at Norfolk, Va., 
with a large attendance. There were 
reports on foreign home missions, edu- 
cation, church extension. Five thou- 
sand dollars was appropriated for the 
Canal Zone, $50,000 for foreign mis- 
sions, and $25,000 for education. The 
Women’s Auxiliary Board was under 
the presidency of Mrs. M. A. D. 
Fuller. 

The Lott Carey National Baptist 
convention was held in Columbia, 
S. C., the last week in August.

“RISIS 





Be! 





HE Howards have proven one the- 
ory and defied another. 

You remember Emerson’s theory 
about the mouse trap and the beaten 
path. Also you know that the modern 
theory of business practice includes 
“location” as a most important factor 
in success. “The Howards opened a res- 
taurant which everyone said was ‘“‘too 
far out” and yet, they have made it pay 
and besides have accumulated in ten 
years property valued at approximately 
$20,000. 

To build a business in defiance of 
certain accepted principles of pro- 
cedure requires a “plus” of something 
to offset the deficiency of something 
else. It is, therefore, the adjustment of 
the “plus” to the “deficiency” which 
has given the Howard’s success an 
unique aspect. 

To begin with, Mrs. Howard is res- 
taurant-minded. When still in her 
“teens” she graduated from the school 
at her home in Camden, Arkansas, and 
began teaching at a salary of $25 per 
month. Her home was located near 
a barrel and stave factory, which em- 
ployed a large number of “hands”. 


Her spare time from school was oc- 
cupied in preparing pies, pop-overs, pea- 
nuts, and other nicknacks which were 
sold to these factory workers. With 
this extra money she lifted a mortgage 
from the home place, and gave her 
mother ‘‘peace of mind”, from worry 
and provided this parent, to whom she 
is deeply devoted, some of the com- 
forts which poverty had denied her. 

In 1912 Mrs. Howard (then Miss 
Dunn) was called to the faculty of 
Tuskegee Institute, but even her duties 
with the school did not suppress the in- 
nate urge to feed the public as the fol- 
lowing incident will show: 

A convenient basement in the dormi- 
tory in which she lived enabled her to 
make an experiment, the idea for which 
took shape in her mind when she saw 
an opportunity to supply sandwiches to 
the student girls. A ham smuggled into 
the dormitory and subsequently boiled 
in the basement was the beginning of a 
successful “bootleg” sandwich shop in 
her room. -However, on one occasion, 
the very inquisitive nose of the dormi- 
tory matron came near wrecking the 
growing business which was saved only 
by the quick and resourceful mind. of 
Miss Dunn. “I smell onions cooking 
in this building,” excitedly said the ma- 
tron one day as she started towards the 
basement after a tour of the upper floors 
in search of the source of the discon-

The Restaurant “Too Far Out”

certing odor. Hearing footsteps over- 
head, Miss Dunn rushed up the base- 
ment steps, stopped the matron on the 
top step, and in the most calm and cas- 
ual manner replied, “Yes, | am making 
an onion stew for one of the girls who 
has.a cold.” This remark stretched 
the truth, but it turned the matron 
back and saved the business. 

After her marriage to Captain Henry 
Howard, himself a Tuskegee graduate, 
Mrs. Howard resigned as a teacher at 
the Institute and began, in 1918, to 
serve meals to teachers and students at 
her home. Three years later the place 
“too far out’ was purchased and re- 
modeled into a twenty room hotel and 
restaurant. The new place which is al- 
most three-quarters of a mile from the 
“centre of things” at Tuskegee Insti- 
tute, was opened in the Spring and a 
novel Easter Lunch Box was featured 
This is a specially constructed box con- 
taining an imitation hen’s nest filled 
with colored eggs and surrounded with 
tasty sandwiches. The first Easter 
showed a net profit of more than $150 
on the boxes. At other times during 
the year, Mrs. Howard serves a special 
Dollar Lunch Box in addition to the 
regular meals. This box contains a 
whole fried chicken, hot buttered bis- 
cuits, fruit, and a piece of cake. 

Mrs. Howard’s intuition and quick 
resourcefulness is only matched by the 
versatility of her husband, who is an 
expert in poultry raising, farming, and 
all-round handy work with carpenter’s 
tools. An acre and a half of rolling 


land at the rear of the hotel is a regu- 
lar truck garden which Captain How- 
ard personally cultivates. Cabbage, let- 
tuce, beets, onions, string beans, toma- 
toes, corn, white potatoes, English peas, 
carrots, and other vegetables are raised 
in abundance to take care of the needs 
of the restaurant and to sell to the 
families of the community. Two score 
peach trees may be seen from the back 
window of the restaurant. This fruit 
will be sold in baskets, served in de- 
licious cobblers, and the surplus canned 
for winter use. 


“You see,” said Mrs. Howard as we 
stood in the garden, “here are my 
flowers. I raise them for table deco- 
rations and to sell. Yesterday was 
Mothers’ Day, and we sold over $12 
worth to the teachers and students.” 


From the garden I was invited to see 
the chicken yard. First the incubator 
house with four large incubators; then 
the brooder house; and finally, the sev- 
eral divisions of the chicken yard con- 
taining broilers, friers, and roasters— 
seven hundred in all. 

“How many eggs do you get a day?” 
I asked Mrs. Howard. “Last night 
Captain brought in fifty-nine for the 
day, and Henry Terrell” (meaning her 
seven year old son) “said that one of 
his hens was laying and he went out 
and brought in three more. We run 
from four to six dozen eggs a day.” 

In addition to the chickens, there are 
guineas, ducks, three milk cows, and six 
hogs fattening for fall slaughter.

A Son of Africa Speaks 
By LAURA TANNE 


ILENCE between us hung as a slow 
twilight 

Over a sadfaced mother imploring us 
to speak. 


The red roseleaves I dropt at your feet 
You trampled upon and perceived coldly 
The reflection of my bleeding heart. 


Your bread was mouldy with a long 
hoarding. 
Your cup shone like an amber jewel 


against your full belly. 


Laughter you would not share with me; 
The gnawed bones of my sorrow you 
cast upon my threshold. 


On my hearth you placed ashes and 
stones and a gravel blanket. 

In my harveSt fields you planted faggots 
to burn the flesh of my children. 

Now you would bid me speak to you; 

But there is a slow fire in my dusky eyes 

Which frightens you,and you turn away 
in fear. 


I who dropt roseleaves at the feet of the 
strong, 

Harbor a hidden sword. The hissing 
hate in my breath sharpens it. 


My bread lies safe within the cupboard 
of the righteous; 

My wine, for long waiting, rises in a 
rich red torrent 

For throats long parched. 


My laughter rises like the hoofbeats of 
a million black steeds, 


Stirring an ocean of dust to drown your 


vision. 

Sorrow, my maimed and singing child, 
has grown to militant manhood. 

His tears have become poisoned sprays 
of fiercest acid 

For your ripe orchards. 


Our hearth fires crackle with visions; 

It shoots into the star-edged chimney of 
the future. 

Our fields, manured with the incalculable 
and luscious flesh of kinsmen, 

Give forth the sinewy food of fighters, 

The - undiminishable nourishment ~of 
dreamers. 


The earth shrouds us with her strength; 

She blows the breath of rebellion into 
our mouths 

As life is blown into the newborn babe. 

From her mountain tops a stern, misty- 
bearded wind chants: 

“Unity, imperishable Unity, O black 


hl 
men.

THE POETS CORNER 





And fire leaps from his nostrils, sweat 
pours from his armpits. 


But on your footpaths she has set the 
hounds of her displeasure, 

And they howl on the barren desert of 
your impending impotency. 
They show fangs, white as your pallor, 

white as the heart of syphilis, 
White as the bone of disaster. 


Is it your turn then to eat the ancient 
bread of your black servant? 

In terror do you seek refuge behind 
steel walls and bayonets! 


The Shining Parlor 
By ANITA SCOTT COLEMAN 


T was a drab street 
A white man’s street... 
Jammed with automobiles 
Street cars and trucks; 
Bee-hived with fruit venders’ stalls. 
Real estate concerns, meat shops, 
Dental clinics and soft drink stands. 


It was a drab street 
A white man’s street... 
But it held the shining parlor— 
A boot-black booth, 
Commandeered by a black man, 
Who spent much time smiling out 
Upon the hub-bub of the thoroughfare. 


Ever . . . serenely smiling .. . 
With a brush and a soiled rag in his 
hands. 
Often . . . white patrons wait for 
Their boots to be “shined” 
Wondering the while 
At the wonder— 
Of the black man’s smile. 





Dead Man Blues 
By CHALLISS SILVAY

back home t’ death, Lawd, 
Yo’ done me wrong. 


No yaller gals now

no gin t’ step up 
mah weary head; 

no jackass poker,

no lucky dices 

fo’ me to roll. 

No laughin’ sunshine,

What did Ah do, Lawd, 


t’ git this way? 


Ah couldn’t eben 
be nigger long; 
back home t’ death, Lawd, 


Yo’ done me wrong. 





Fugit Amor 


By VIRGINIA V. HOUSTON 
| AM sorry, Beloved, 


That our hands were sered 
By the star we reached for, 
That our fingers ache 
Because a golden moon turned ice, 
And that our eyes, blinded 
by the too strong light of our love, 
Dare not look upon our hearts 
Grown ponderous with emptiness. 


We, who flaunted in Fortune’s grim face 
Our boast that we had no need of wis-

oT HE good old days are gone,” age 
sighed, 


“They’ve just begun!” cried youth; 
Each one the other’s words decried, 
And knew he spoke the truth!

Who thought himself so wise; 
Fate had been unkind to him 
And gave him jaundiced eyes,

The Fulfillment 
By DOROTHY KRUGER 


Al through a night the wind’s too 

hoarse complaining 

Hurried the red gold leaves to sleep : 
against 

The silent ground, an old man tried to 
sound 

The vacuum in his mind, not knowing it 

Was emptiness that gnawed him. With- 
in a hut 

Whose walls drew closer to each other, 
snarled 

A fire and ate voraciously the logs 

He fed it while he saw through screwed 
up eyes 

The running years that bore him from a 
cloister 

On a song swept coast, to this high place. 

Years that had promised him the blue 





and gold 

Lagoons where fevers spawned, or sharp- 
ened teeth 

In green black jungles and the feel of 
fire 


Heightened by hungry hate and 
pinioned him 

Fast to an isolated mountain side 

Where pines instead of people grew. 
Now, 


Suddenly as the lightning sees a river,

THE Crisis 












T is Mississippi. “The River’ is on 

its annual rampage. Wastes of water 
spread over the landscape. Houses are 
submerged up to the second story. Boats 
have replaced automobiles and buggies. 
Boys and women and a few white men 
fish for ‘cat’? where the plow stood a 
few weeks ago. At any time, any and 
every Negro may be impressed to save 
the levees. Now convicts from all over 
the state are assembled under prison 
guards to strengthen levees and rail- 
road embankments. Bags of concrete 
are piled high while the sullen yellow 
river gnaws at the banks like a hungry 
rat. Everywhere there is unrest and 
an atmosphere of fear and suspense. 
Along with it is irritation and a sullen 
ugliness of temper occasioned by the 
frustration of hopes. 

The railroad embankment runs like 
a ribbon flanked by the flowing waters 
—hbut as we get away from Vicksburg 
we find fields above ground. Looking 
out of my car window as my train 
scuttled across the state as if it feared 
the rising waters might engulf it, | was 
riveted by a scene in the field opposite 
me. A Negro was desperately fleeing. 
Behind him ran two white men. I saw 
the flashes of their pistols as they fired 
at him. All at once, he stumbled, threw 
up both arms and fell. In a moment he 
was on his feet once more. Again, the 
two whites running towards him blazed 
away, as he haltingly fled before them. 
My train whisked me out of sight and 
I shall never know whether the Negro 
was killed. He probably was. Who 
were the whites—officers or civilians? 
I shall never know. I scanned the pa- 
pers for days afterwards but saw no 
word of what had happened. When I 
told my friend in Louisiana, he merely 
shrugged his shoulders and said— 
“Why, that was merely an incident”— 
a common one. “The world never hears 
of many things like that.” In Baton 
Rouge they told me how Negroes dared 
not report whippings and lynchings. 
Right across the river, a few days be- 
fore I reached that city, a Negro work- 
ing in front of the home of a white 
butcher indulged his proclivity to oaths 
and obscene language, so the butcher’s 
wife proclaimed. At any rate, her hus- 
band when she told him, got together a 
gang of his friends and took the Negro 
out and lynched him. Nobody was ar- 
rested. No inquest was held. No news- 
paper carried any account. It was just 
another dead Negro. Negroes say the 
woman has lost her mind since and has 
been committed to an insane asylum—

The Present South — 


By ROBERT W. BAGNALL 


Field Secretaries of the N. A. A. 


C. P. have recently been travelling 


through the South. Here are some 
impressions of his trip by Mr. 
Bagnall. 





but that may be only a myth. They 
whispered dark things and hint that 
the lynched Negro’s profanity was not 
what really angered the woman. 

In the upper part of Louisiana—as 
in most places of the South—the whites 
believe that Chief Justice Taney’s de- 
cision that “a Negro has no rights 
which a white man is bound to respect” 
yet holds. A Negro sued the parish 
for damages he had suffered. His was 
a good case. Therefore, persons close 
to the affairs of the parish determined 
to settle the matter out of court. They 
took him for a ride, flogged him until 
his clothing had been cut to ribbons and 
his back was in shreds, broke his arm, 
threw him out in the road and ordered 
him never to return to the parish. The 
encouraging thing is that he has cour- 
age enough to continue his fight in 
court. I understand, too, action is to 
be started against his assailants whom 
he recognized, it is stated, as officers of 
the parish. 

But it is “the magic city” of Bir- 
mingham which holds the prize for 
terrorism. There police and courts are 
run by that order of thugs—the Ku 
Klux Klan. Without provocation po- 
lice shoot Negroes so frequently there, 
that it is no longer news. Negroes are 
beaten up daily for standing on the 
streets. Recently the police killed a 
school-teacher because he was standing 
on a corner and didn’t move with suff- 
cient alacrity at their orders. Some- 
while before, they found an undertaker 
asleep in his own car at night, in front 
of the house in which he was boarding. 
Thieves somewhile before had stripped 
his car of tires. He decided to sleep in 
it so as to guard against further theft. 
Two police officers came along late in 
the night and saw him asleep with his 
pistol on the seat between his legs. 
They put a gun to his breast and fired, 
killing him instantly, and then woke 
the people in the house and told what 
they had done. What was done about 
it? Nothing! When the N. A. A. 
C. P. offered to send an investigator 
concerning this and other atrocities, 
prominent Negro citizens of Birming- 
ham insisted that he should not be sent. 


In fact, Negroes are so afraid in Bir- 
mingham that out of twenty-four out- 


standing persons written to about re- 
organizing the work of the Association 
there, not one answered. They frankly 
tell you—“We are afraid.” An aura of 
fear. that presses upon one like a black 
cloud surrounds Negroes in this city. 
They have wealth and live in nice 
houses but they cringe before whites 
and curry favor with the whites in 
power by sacrificing all their rights. 
There are a few exceptions among the 
younger men. 


Not only are the police brutal and 
sadistic, but the civilians are of the 
same type. A short while ago in one of 
Birmingham’s suburbs a young Negro 
woman, a college graduate from a well- 
to-do family, went into a drug store a 
block or so from her home. The clerk 
ignored her presence and waited on 
several white persons who had come 
into the store after her entrance. She 
started to leave. Upon this, the clerk 
burst into abuse and slapped her. The 
girl ran to her home and told her 
brother, an undertaker and a graduate 
of Howard University. When he ran 
to the drug store an officer in the door- 
way seized him as he attempted to 
enter. Back in the store stood another 
officer and the clerk, both with drawn 
pistols. The young Negro and his sis- 
ter were arrested and charged with dis- 
orderly conduct. The man was given a 
suspended sentence and the woman was 
fined $10 for being slapped. The young 
undertaker procured a warrant against 
the white drug clerk for assaulting his 
sister but the charge was dismissed. 

Down in South Georgia at Americus 
some one reported that liquor was being 
sold in a restaurant. In Americus there 
are no comfort stations for Negroes— 
only whites. A hard working respec- 
table Negro, from the country, had 
gone into this restaurant at the de- 
mands of nature. He was just coming 
out when the police entered and an 
officer drew his gun and pushed it in 
the Negro’s stomach as he tried to pass 
him. The colored man believing the 
officer about to shoot, grabbed the gun 
and prevented him using it. He was 
about to twist it from the officer’s hand, 
when the brave representative of the 
law yelled for help. Two officers 
rushed to his aid and putting their guns 
against the body of the Negro emptied 
them, killing him. Nothing has been 
done about it although our branch there 
is trying to push the case. 

They tell me that Tennessee is much 
better. But they also told me how two

OUR years ago a small group of 

college executives met at A. & T. 
College, in Greensboro, N. C. for the 
purpose of forming an organization 
which would bring together persons of 
like interests and determination to 
study the problems common to them in 
the prosecution of their work. They 
met, and worked, and planned, and 
finally adjourned with the feeling that 
a new idea had been born, and with the 
sense of a great task well begun. It 
was the conviction of every one that 
this was not just another organization 
brought into being in order to meet 
some emergency, or to spread propa- 
ganda, or to promote the personal or 
private interests of any individual or 
group of individuals, but rather that 
here was an attempt to meet a long 
felt but unexpressed need: That of 
supplying a medium through which the 
problems of the Negro colleges both 
within themselves and as they relate to 
the secondary school below and the 
graduate and professional schools above 
could be revealed, analyzed, and at- 
tacked. 

From the very beginning and until 
now the membership has been animated 
by the spirit and desire to approach 
these problems from a thoroughly ob- 
jective and scientific viewpoint, and to 
apply the most modern theories and 
practices in the work of the deans and 
registrars. 

It is a generally understood and ac- 
cepted principle that no one shall ap- 
pear before the Association in a formal 
manner without thorough preparation. 
Every paper or discussion that is pre- 
sented is based on objective data scien- 
tifically gathered, analyzed, and inter- 
preted. The participants on the pro- 
grams always work untiringly in an 
effort to contribute something of value 
to the Conference; and while criticisms 
of the papers are usually plentiful they 
are offered with generosity and ac- 
cepted in the same spirit. 


A few of the topics which have been 
discussed at previous Conferences will 
furnish some idea of the nature and 
scope of our endeavors: 

Relation of the Registrar to the Col- 
lege; Importance of Keeping Accurate 
High School Records; Registration 
Procedure; Entrance Requirements for 
Professional Schools; Evaluation of 
High School Credits; Standards for an 
A-Grade College; the Admission, 
Orientation, Scholarship and Back- 
grounds of Freshmen; Reporting, Eval- 
uating, and Required Entrance Cred-

and the Curricula of Teacher Train- 
ing Colleges. 

As evidence of the fact that the 
Association is meeting a real need, men- 
tion need be made only of the increas- 
ing attendance. At the first meeting 
there were 23 delegates, representing 
20 schools; at the second meeting there 
were 41 delegates, representing 36 
schools; at the third conference 54 del- 
egates_ registered, representing 41 
schools. At the 4th Conference, there 
were 40 delegates representing 26 
schools. 

The Association welcomes into its 
membership all schools doing at least 
one year of college work. It should 
also be noted that presidents of col- 
leges, as well as principals of high 
schools are invited and urged to attend 
the sessions. Membership is by school 


and the fee is $5.00 annually. 


Special mention should be made of 
Dean T. E. McKinney, of A. & T. 
College, Greensboro, N. C., who con- 
ceived the idea and called the first Con- 
ference. Dean McKinney became the 
first president of the Association and 
held that office for two years. He 
worked arduously and patiently, along 
with his associate officers to make the 
organization all that they hoped it to 
be. While much credit is due the or- 
ganizer and first president for his wis- 
dom, faith and vision, it cannot be 
gainsaid that the Association has pro- 
gressed far beyond his wildest dreams 
and most sanguine hopes. 

Through this Association the Negro 
college hopes to do a significant piece of 
work in the way of educating its youth. 
The officers and members feel that 
there is no reason why they should not 
blaze a few trails in the educational 
process. They are also making every 


effort to share in some of the other 
more significant innovations in higher 
education, especially in the matter of 
Personnel work and Cooperative Meas- 
ures. This organization has a splendid 
opportunity to study the problem of se- 
lection and admission of students who 
are capable of continued training. It 
is a well known fact that there are 
many students who manage to get in 
college who cannot profit by the educa- 
tion which the college is supposed to 
offer; and, also, there are many who 
could benefit by the training offered in 
the colleges and universities, but who 
are either never found or never en- 
couraged to take advantage of this in- 
creased training. ‘There are entirely 
too few persons who have the capacity 
and interest to go on, therefore every 
effort should be made by us to find 
these individuals as early as possible, 
and to do everything in our power to 
help them get the proper preparation to 
enter and succeed in college. To at- 
tack this problem it requires the coop- 
eration not only of the colleges them- 
selves, but of the public schools and 
graduate and professional schools as 
well. The National Association of 
Collegiate Deans and Registrars is well 
equipped in its personnel and in the 
very nature of its organization to at- 
tempt such a task. Already the Asso- 
ciation has started work in this direc- 
tion. 

The problem of improving the edu- 
cational process within the college is 
also being undertaken by this Associa- 
tion as is indicated by previous Confer- 
ence programs; and it recognizes the 
necessity of basing such improvement 
and reorganization on personnel re- 
search. The Association’s activities in 
this field have already been mentioned. 

The value of the application of prin- 
ciples of scientific management to the 
work of the dean and registrar is also 
being considered, and certain members 
are making an intensive study of the 
technique, procedures, forms, etc., in 
an effort to make the offices function in 
the most effective manner as the educa- 
tional administrative unit of an institu- 
tion. It is gradually being learned 
that a clear understanding of the func- 
tion of the educational administrative 
unit must be based on the assumption 
that it is a service organization, and as 
such has no ends in itself, but is merely 
one of the agencies by means of which 
the educational system or organization 
attempts to realize its aims. It, there- 
fore, has a dual function: educational

HERE are about 7,000 Negro phy- 

sicians who are administering to 
the health needs of America today, and 
in the main to the health needs of color- 
ed people. The majority of these medi- 
cal men are located east of the Missis- 
sippi river. A general idea of their dis- 
tribution may be gained by stating 
roughly the numbers found in certain 
cities, for example: Boston 40, New 
York City 120, Atlanta 100, Wash- 
ington, D. C., 120, Chicago 175, Nash- 
ville 90, Detroit 60, Cleveland 50, 
Baltimore 70, New Orleans 50, Jack- 
sonville, Fla., 30, St. Louis 85, Kan- 
sas City 70. Prior to the world war 
the bulk of the Negro physicians were 
to be found in the South; but with the 
migration of colored people to the 
larger industrial centers of the North 
the Negro physician also migrated. The 
reason being that he was in search of 
increased scientific opportunity and to 
improve his economic condition. The 
colored physician also shows substan- 
tially the same tendency to concentrate 
in the urban centers as does his white 
professional brother. 

Contrary to the prevailing opinion in 
this country, the average Negro physi- 
cian doing general practice has received 
the same degree of training as the aver- 
age physician of any other race; no 
more, no less. Opportunity for the 
study of Medicine is offered by two 
medical schools established primarily 
for the training of Negro physicians, 
which are: Howard University in 
Washington, D. C., and Meharry 
Medical College in Nashville, Tenn. 
These two schools are rated as Class 
“A” medical colleges by the American 
Medical Association. These two schools 
graduate about three-fourths of the col- 
ored physicians now in practice. The 
remaining one-fourth are graduates of 
the white medical colleges of the East 
and Middle West. One-third of the 
Negro medical graduates are also col- 
lege graduates; and all graduates to- 
day, if they do not hold a college de- 
gree, have completed an accredited 
premedical course before undertaking 
the study of medicine. 

There are a limited number of hos- 
pitals in which colored medical gradu- 
ates may receive training as internes; 
namely: Freedmen’s Hospital, Wash- 
ington, D. C.; Provident Hospital, 
Chicago; the Old General Hospital, 
Kansas City; The Hubbard Hospital, 
Nashville, Tenn., the Mercy Hospital, 
Philadelphia; the Colored Division of 
the City Hospital in St. Louis, and the

The Negro Physician 


By LOUIS T. WRIGHT, M.D. 


Dr. Louis T. Wright, the author 
of this article, is one of the most 
distinguished Negro physicians in 
the United States. He was born in 
1891 in Georgia; educated at Clark 
University, at the Harvard Medi- 
cal School, and entered the war as 
First Lieutenant in the Medical 
Section, Officers’ Reserve Corps, 
1917. He served at Fort Des 
Moines and on the western front 
in Europe, where he was promoted 
to a Captaincy. Since 1919, he has 
practiced in New York, acting as 
Surgeon in the Out-Patient De- 
partment of the Harlem Hospital, 
and now as Assistant Visiting Sur- 
geon. Recently, he has been made 
surgeon in the Police Department 
of the City of New York with the 
rank of Inspector. 





John A. Andrew Hospital at Tuske- 
gee; all of these are colored institutions. 
On the other hand the Cook County 
Hospital in Chicago, and the Harlem 
Hospital in this city accept Negro phy- 
sicians as internes, after competitive ex- 
amination, on the same basis as mem- 
bers of any other racial groups. The 
Bellevue Hospital of this city, has 
graduated several colored internes. 
These are the only large hospitals that 
have given the Negro doctor the same 
opportunity for training as that af- 
forded any other citizen. It is esti- 
mated that about one-fourth of the col- 
ored physicians have received training 
as internes before starting out in the 
practice of medicine. 

As to Postgraduate training, the op- 
portunities are very meager indeed. 
Some have taken summer courses and 
special courses at the Harvard Uni- 
versity Graduate School of Medicine, 
and the Graduate School of Medicine 
of Columbia University; but on the 
whole they are not welcome nor desired 
in most postgraduate schools. ‘This is 
especially true as far as clinical courses 
are concerned. In some post graduate 
hospitals, they are permitted to take 
cadaver courses but that is all. Many 
of these physicians, therefore, who de- 
sire to do postgraduate work of a sound 
character, have been forced to go to 
Europe to study. It is a serious indict- 
ment of American institutions that so 
many Negro physicians have been 
forced to go to Europe to receive ade- 
quate clinical training of a postgraduate 
nature, and thus properly to equip 
themselves to look after the health of 
American citizens, 


In State Board examinations for 
medical licensure the colored candidates 
maintain about the same average as all 
other candidates; in some instances 
they make the highest mark, and in 
other instances the lowest. On the 
whole the same percentage pass and the 
same percentage fail proportionately as 
other racial groups, excepting in the 
States of Florida and Mississippi, 
where I understand that the percentage 
of failures is greater than that of the 
whites. It is generally stated that it 
is almost impossible for a Negro gradu- 
ate of a northern medical school to 
qualify for a license in these two states, 
although the same candidate may pass 
the examination in a northern state 
with relative ease. A number of Negro 
physicians have taken the examination 
of the National Board of Medical Ex- 
aminers, and although I know quite a 
few who have passed, I do not know 
personally one who has failed, although 
doubtless some have. 

At Tuskegee, Alabama, is the United 
States Veterans Hospital No. 91. All 
of its patients are colored ex-service 
men, and the entire staff is composed 
of colored physicians of the highest 
caliber. I am told that this hospital 
has been rated since it was first estab- 
lished, as one of the best managed 
Veterans’ Hospitals in this country, 
both as to administration and in the 
character of scientific work done. 

The hospital connections available 
for the licensed graduate are offered by 
the so-called colored hospitals. They 
have a mixed staff, composed of about 
an equal number of white and colored 
physicians. The interne staff is entire- 
ly colored. Qualified Negro physicians 
are gradually being taken on the staff 
of some of the larger Northern hos- 
pitals. This is seen at the Cook Coun- 
ty Hospital in Chicago, the Harlem 
Hospital and the Broad Street Hospital 
in the city of New York, the Cleveland 
City Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, and, 
prior to its moving uptown, Negro phy- 
sicians were on the staff at the Vander- 
bilt Clinic. There are none there now. 
The St. Lukes’ Hospital in Chicago, 
the Rochester General Hospital in 
Rochester, N. Y., the German Ameri- 
can Hospital in Chicago, and the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania each have one 
distinguished Negro physician on their 
staff. 

The National Medical Association is 
the recognized national organization of 
colored physicians. It has done signal 
service in raising the standards of prac-

tice among its members; and it has been 
ever alert in attempting by every 
known legitimate means to increase op- 
portunities for training and in research, 
in places where they are now denied to 
its members. Under the leadership of 
Dr. Eugene H. Dibble, the John A. 
Andrew Clinical Society has rendered 
a great service to the physicians of the 
South in a scientific way. 

The majority of colored physicians 
are engaged in general practice. They 
are hard workers, and their life is full 
of vissitudes, but at the same time it is 
rich and satisfying. I know of no man 
of any color who has a larger practice 
than Dr. Norman T. Cotton of Pat- 
terson, New Jersey; he is one of the 
Commissioners of Health for the city, 
and his practice is equally divided be- 
tween the two races. Walter White 
in his powerful novel, the “Fire in the 
Flint” has accurately depicted the life 
of the Negro doctor in the rural parts 
of the South. The Negro doctor in the 
city meets the same problems and his 
life runs along in about the same chan- 
nel as that of other city physicians, but 
for the fact that he has to fight many 
handicaps because of color. 

Many colored doctors served as 
medical officers with colored military 
units during the World War, chiefly 
but not entirely with the 92nd Divi- 
sion. A communication dated Novem- 
ber 15, 1918, concerning the hospital 
at Millery, was received by the Divi- 
sion Surgeon of the 92nd Division from 
Col. C. R. Reynolds, Chief Surgeon, 


Second Army, American Expeditionary 
Forces: “I desire to express my admira- 
tion and appreciation of the splendid 
hospital organized and administered by 
the Medical Department of the 92nd 
Division at Millery. 

“Your Department has received most 
favorable comment by the Army Com- 
mander, the Sanitary Inspector, Sec- 
ond Army, and the officers in charge of 
Sanitation in the office of the chief sur- 
geon, American Expeditionary Forces, 
and of all medical officers who have 
visited the institution. The transporta- 
tion and hospitalization of the battle 
casualties and respiratory diseases have 
been accomplished in accord with the 
principles of military surgery and pre- 
ventive medicine, which reflects the in- 
telligence and training on the part of 
the medical officers, nurses and enlisted 
men of the 92nd Div., in which pride 
may be justly felt.” 

There are many distinguished Negro 
physicians in this country. Three are 
administrators of large hospitals; sev- 
eral are on the staff of great northern 
universities: there is an Associate pro- 
fessor of Medicine at the Boston Uni- 
versity School of Medicine, a Patho- 
logist at the Boston Dispensary, who 
is also instructor in the Graduate 
School of Medicine of the Harvard 
Medical School. His new serological 
test for syphilis is well known. 

There is an assistant professor of 
Pathology and a special lecturer in Op- 
thalmology at the University of Chica- 
go; the professor of Physiology at 


Howard University is one of the great- 
est authorities in the world on sperma- 
togencsis. Negro Dermatologists are on 
the staff of the Cook County Hospital, 
Chicago, and the Harlem Hospital, 
New York. There are colored visiting 
surgeons at many white hospitals, like 
St. Luke’s, Chicago, and the Broad 
Street Hospital, New York. 

There are specialists in nose and 
throat diseases, and in x-ray, and New 
York has a specialist on the diseases of 
children. In Philadelphia and New 
York, there are experts on tuberculosis, 
and in Washington there is a specialist 
in Public Health work. There are a 
number of distinguished Negro sur- 
geons. One was instructor in anatomy 
in Northwestern for several years. One 
is at the head of the surgical service at 
the United States Veterans’ Hospital, 
No. 91. Two are connected with the 
Freeman’s Hospital. 

A considerable list of such distin- 
guished practitioners might be made. 
Nearly all the men mentioned above 
have conducted researches of a major 
character and most of them are en- 
gaged in teaching in which disease 
draws no color line, and any improve- 
ment in the standards of practice and 
increased opportunity for research and 
teaching on the part of Negro physi- 
cians is reflected in better living condi- 
tions among colored people. It follows 
that an improvement in the health of 
one-tenth of our population necessarily 
means corresponding improvement in 
the health of all Americans. 


Wisdom from Africa 


By MELVILLE J. HERSKOVITS 


LTHOUGH growing recognition 

of what American music and 
literature owe to Africa has resulted in 
the acclaim which Negro music has re- 
ceived of late, and the Uncle Remus 
and kindred tales have brought joy to 
generations of Americans, relatively 
fittle has been done to tap the African 
source of these achievements. The con- 
viction has been finding more and more 
expression, however, that the fountain- 
head should be studied to bring to light 
the richness which we know to be there, 
and more and more attention is being 
paid to the cultures of Africa. And be- 
cause I agree that this should be done, 
I felt it was a fortunate combination 
of circumstances, which, almost two 
years ago brought me into contact with 
Sie Tagbwe, and which enabled us to 
devise a plan whereby we might work

Professor Herskovits of North- 
western University, author of “The 


American Negro’, writes this 
sketch “in memoriam, Sie Tagbwe; 
born in Segrekpo, Liberia; died 
13th April, 1929, in Chicago.” 


out together the language and lore and 
customs of his people, the Liberian Kru 
of the region of Cape Palmas. This 
plan was presented to Northwestern 
University, and, with a realization of 
the striking material which might be 
placed on record through the utiliza- 
tion of Mr. Tagbwe’s knowledge of 
the life of his people, was approved and 
financed by that institution. 

Since then and until his sudden and 
tragic death, Mr. Tagbwe and I spent 





several hours a week together going 
over manuscript which he brought me 
in text and translation, probing into the 
grammatical intricacies of Kru speech, 
systematizing his knowledge of the re- 
lationship system of his people, and pre- 
paring stories and proverbs for publica- 
tion. It was the proverbs on which we 
first concentrated, for it seemed to us 
that these sayings offered deep insight 
into the life of his people, that they 
afforded material for the study of the 
language, and that they constituted a 
logical initial division of the work on 
which we were engaged. A week before 
his death he visited me for the last 
time, and the first draft of the bulky 
manuscript which contained almost two 
hundred of these sayings, with explana- 
tions of their meaning to the Kru, when 
they are used, and their ramifications

into other phases of their life was fin- 
ished but for three or four minor ques- 
tions which had arisen in the typing of 
the last two or three pages. And it is 
as a tribute to his intelligence and in- 
sight that 1 wish here to give a few of 
these pithy sayings, and to indicate the 
imagination and the poetic concepts 
which they embody for his people, and 
which they continued to embody for 
him despite all his contacts with Ameri- 
can life. 

That this type of expression is deeply 
seated in the cultures of Africa need 
scarcely be stated. Mr. Clement M. 
Doke was able to gather the almost in- 
credible number of 1,698 proverbs from 
one tribe and still confessed that his 
collection was not a complete one; such 
a fact tells the extent to which they are 
used more vividly than any elaboration 
of the theme. Yet not only the texts of 
the sayings must be considered, but 
their setting in the civilization of the 
people who use them. Certain ques- 
tions should always arise in the minds 
of one who reads a proverb of an alien 
people: ““What is meant by this say- 
ing?” “When is it used ?” And it was to 
answer these two questions that Mr. 
Tagbwe labored long and faithfully 
with me, not being satisfied until he 
was sure that we both understood each 
other completely, and that the explana- 
tion of the proverb was so couched that 
the reader, too, would know not only 
the translation of the Kru words but 
the social significance of the sayings. 

To read all of the sayings, with the 
commentaries on them, gives one a 
vivid sense of living the life of the Kru. 
We see the elders employing them to 
correct children and to warn them of 
what should not be done; and we find 
not only children, but presumptious and 
forward and impolite grown-ups also 
rebuked by their use. People comment 
on current happenings of the day with 
them; they help to settle disputes, or 
one may use a proverb to commiserate 
a friend on his ill-fortune. That the 
Kru live little everyday experiences 
like the rest of us comes out of them 
with great clarity; husbands and wives 
employ them in family squabbles, or an 
insult may be passed, using one of these 
sayings, and as a result there is serious 
trouble in the village. Nor is this al- 
ways done directly, for some of these 
proverbs are spoken to a second person 
when a person wishes to insult a third 
with whom he will not deal directly. 
Some of them have a theme familiar to 
our money-loving civilization: life is 
uncertain, and one should not be a 
spendthrift, but put aside for old age! 
And especially does family solidarity 
shine through the sayings, the fact that 
one need not be ashamed to come home 
to tell his troubles, that relatives are 


’

the only sure source of help in time of 
need, and that a person should never 
desert those who make up his close 
family circle. Admonitions to be po- 
lite, not to indulge in gossip and the 
petty raking over of the minute details 
of the life of everyone in the commu- 
nity, together with a lively suspicion of 
the loose-mouthed person are found, 
while there is emphasis on self-reliance 
and injunctions against shiftlessness. 

But the proverbs can best speak for 
themselves. 


“From the instruction of the house- 
fly the bee became wise.” The bee, in 
the story from which this saying is 
drawn, was an orphan, and made his 
home with Fly’s people. And while 
Fly never did what his mother told 
him to do, Bee paid strict attention, for 
among the Kru the way of the orphan 
is a difficult one, and it behooved him 
to be better than those whose parents 
were living were he to get on. And so 
when the two grew up, they became as 
we know them, the fly shiftless, the bee 
thrifty and successful. And that is why 
a mother repeats this saying to a child 
who does not listen to her teaching. 


“Trouble is afraid of the man who 
is respected.” The man who “has a 
broad face” is listened to, particularly 
when he brings a case to court. So if 
a person is in trouble and cannot bring 
the culprit to book, he will get such a 
respected person to help him, and a 
word will often solve the problem. 
And, of course, this is an injunction to 
the young to try to be like such men, so 
that they will not have to face the diffi- 
culties which beset those who do not 
have the respect of the other members 
of the community. 


“The sound of the snapping of the 
trap that has caught me remains in my 
ears.” I do not know of any other one 
proverb in the collection that makes the 
point of the necessity of probing be- 
neath the surface to find the true mean- 
ing quite as does this one. The obvious 
significance, to any of us, would be the 
same as that of our own saying “The 
burnt child fears the fire.” Indeed, this 
aspect of the study so amused Mr. 
Tagbwe that often, before he would 
explain the meaning of a proverb, he 
would ask me to tell him what I 
thought it meant. And then he would 
consider my interpretation and say 
“Yes, I can understand how you would 
think that is what it means’; but he 
would usually end with “The Kru 
people don’t have that meaning for it’. 
In this case, the saying really is a polite 
way of asking a speaker to repeat what 
he has just said. “I have heard the trap 
snap, but I do not quite know its sig- 
nificance’’, and it is the exact equivalent 
of our conversational “I beg your par- 
don?” when we wish something re- 


peated, so that we may better under- 
stand. 


“The Kru say,‘When the eye weeps, 
the nose does not rest’.’ And their 
meaning is that family solidarity is the 
one that counts. For if you harm one 
member of a family, you harm all the 
others, and the one who has been 
wronged will be avenged by his rela- 
tives. “Nwa says, ‘The world moves 
slowly back and forth, and then it 
stands still’”’ Nwa is a little animal 
who lives near the cassava fields, and 
steals what the women grow. And, of 
course, the Kru try to kill him. So 
when the hunters are after him, “the 
world moves back and forth” but when 
he has evaded pursuit and is safe ‘“‘it 
stands still”. And so it is with all of 
us, for trouble often pursues us. But 
the assurance of the proverb is that no 
matter how serious our present troubles 
seem to us, as with time they recede in 
the background, their hurt will lessen 
and life will resume its normal tenor. 


“When the snake has passed, a per- 
son does not strike the ground.” Seize 
your opportunity when it presents it- 
self, for to do so later will be too iate. 
“Crocodile says, “The sun takes a long, 
long time’.” The crocodile who speaks 
is one that waits patiently for its prey, 
—he is as deliberate as the sun moving 
across the sky. But he is none the less 
sure, for sooner or later he will get the 
kill he is waiting for,—and that is why 
this proverb is said by a man who can 
wait to attain his revenge. “He who 
has, turns his eye inward; he who has 
not, looks out for friends.” To turn 
one’s eye inward means to be stingy, 
and I can do no more than to quote 
Mr. Tagbwe’s explanation: “When 
you've got lots of things you don’t see 
anyone, but when you haven’t anything 
you look for friends to help you, and 
begin following them for help.” “What 
the eye has forgotten, the heart still re- 
members.” As among all people, there 
are many instances of where frictiom 
brings on quarrels, often very bitter 
ones. The men concerned may become 
reconciled, but who knows, say the Kru, 
whether these men, apparently friends 
once again, do not nurse their griev- 
ances unknown to anyone else? 





This illustrates a theme which recurs 
again and again in the Kru sayings. It 
is the theme of the inscrutability of a 
human being and the essential dignity 
of humanity. “Though we know 
chicken-hawk, we do not know where 
he flies.’ “A man is not a bunch of 
palm-nuts, that you can sample him.” 
“One does not judge a house by its 
outer appearance.” Or, to cite further 
instances: “Every head must do its own 
thinking.” “North-wind says, “Man is 
like the thorny tree; you must think

@ Paul Cherington, Professor of

draws the following conclusions from 
the National Business League Survey: 
@ “The tables covering the store- 
keeping methods of the Negro mer- 
chants indicate the spread among them 
of the same forces which are driving 
small store-keepers to the adoption of 
modern methods. To be sure 15 per 
cent still show no adequate system of 
bookkeeping, but on the other hand, 
13.5 per cent keep double-entry books, 
59 per cent single-entry books and over 
a quarter of the total have cash regis- 
ters. 

@ “Over 41 per cent buy for cash, 
against 16 per cent on credit and 29 
per cent for both cash and credit. Only 
30 per cent do not advertise at all. 
These figures, if they could be com- 
pared with the facts existing only a 
few years ago, doubtless would show 
marked advance. 

@ “One other set of figures having 
particular interest is that showing the 
age of the establishment covered. Over 
32 per cent of the total had been in 
business over five years,—a _ record 
which would compare favorably with 
the longevity record of any similar 
group of retailers.”

built up a great organization and his 
name became a household word among 
the masses of natives in South Africa. 
Money flowed into the Union and was

not carefully expended or accounted 
for. At the same time, Kadalie was 
the object of injurious attack and es- 
pionage. Finally, Kadalie has been 
forced to resign the General Secretary- 
ship. “The present and future busi- 
nessmen of the African native peoples 
will have to be watchful of their pri- 
vate and public lives because the old 
I. C. U. leaders have directed toward 
them much suspicion and mistrust.”

PECHSTEIN AND PECKSNIFF 
R. L. A. PECHSTEIN of the 
University of Cincinnati last 

February made a Report at the Na- 

tional Society of College ‘Teachers 

meeting in Cleveland. His thesis was 
that the “Segregation of Negro and 
white children in separate schools ac- 
complished far more for the black race 
than can be gained in mixed classes.” 


He stated that among Negroes there 
were two opinions: That the Radicals 
ask for mixed schools, and the Conser- 
vatives want separate schools. His 
basis of fact was that Negro high 
schools had more Negro graduates 
than mixed high schools; that a study 
of 100 Negroes of eminence showed 
that 83 per cent attended separate ele- 
mentary schools, and that about half 
attended mixed colleges; a study of 
3,000 Negro pupils showed much men- 
tal deficiency and retardation, calling 
for special classes. 


It is reported that he relied for his 
facts on the thesis of a colored school 
principal, Dr. Jennie Porter. 

Propaganda further advocating this 
proposal has followed Pechstein’s 
paper. It is time that the matter be 
fairly faced and threshed out. 


School Democracy 


In the first place, it goes without 
saying that Pechstein ignores the back- 
ground of his facts. He says nothing 
of the long battle for educational 
democracy which Negroes conservative 
and radical have fought in Boston, 
New York, Philadelphia and _ else- 
where. He knows perfectly well as 
an educator that the public school is 
not the best possible instrument for 
every single child. Very bright chil- 
dren, very dull children, timid chil- 
dren and over-grown, the children of 
the rich and cultured people, Catholic 
children, Jewish children,—can all 
make great and undoubted advance in 
certain lines if educated by themselves 
and segregated from the rest of the 
community. 

Yet, the United States, Germany, 
France, and most civilized countries 
have urged the public school and 
democracy in education for all. And 
they have done this because of the fact 
that whatever may be lost in this group

education, the human contact which 
comes through democratic education of 
all the youth of a great country, in- 
finitely over balances it. They realize 
that if peace, good-will and industrial 
democracy are going to triumph in the 
world, they can only triumph by in- 
crease in the intelligence of individuals 
and the increase of direct knowledge 
and sympathetic human relationship 
among men. Any step backward from 
this: any building up of artificial bar- 
riers, Or over-emphasizing of natural 
barriers, is a blow in the face of civili- 
zation and human advance. 

In the United States, we rightly fear 
the growth of a separate Catholic 
school system; we are apprehensive at 
the increased tendency of the rich and 
cultured to take their children out of 
the public schools and to make certain 
colleges segregated institutions for 
these children. We dislike the ex- 
ciusive fraternities in colleges, and we 
ban them almost entirely in high 
schools. 

Our feeling in all this matter is that 
the forces of disruption, of hatred, of 
enmity and of misunderstanding be- 
tween groups and individuals are so 
tremendous today and have been so 
fatal in the past that there is almost 
no sacrifice that we ought not to be 
willing to make in order to put down 
increased separation among men and 
in order to multiply understanding, 
sympathy and human acquaintanceship. 

This is the great foundation for the 
public school. 

This program involves many diffi- 
culties. When the poor Irish came to 
Massachusetts in the middle of the 
19th Century, there was bitter oppo- 
sition to their presence in the public 
schools. They were ignorant, dirty, 
ragged and retarded. Italians and 
people from the Balkans of Southeast 
Europe later brought the same prob- 
lems. Naturally, the Negroes, both in 
the past and present, have been a se- 
vere problem for the mixed public 
schools. By slavery, caste, law and 
custom, they have been ignorant and 
poverty-stricken and have lagged be- 
hind the average school age. 


The Negro in School 


And what of it? 
different communities 


In a thousand 
Negro pupils 





have proven their ability to profit by 
the public schools; they have made 
high records and graduated with honor. 
Their poverty is part of a universal 
problem; their retardation is due to 
wretched Southern school systems; 
their dullness comes from poor food 
and poor homes and there is absolutely 
no scientific proof that it is Negroid. 
Every one of these problems has a 
well known and adequately tested 
solution. 

The recent migration of Negroes to 
the North has naturally intensified 
and re-opened these problems but it 
would be a despicable yielding to re- 
action and cowardice to give up democ- 
racy in the public schools because of 
the very disadvantages which lack of 
democracy and opportunity have fast- 
ened upon the Negro population of the 
South. 

In the face of these problems many 
like Pechstein, narrow in reasoning 
and ignorant of all the facts are al- 
ways rushing to find the easiest way 
out of the difficulty. With them work 
the Pecksniffs—the hypocrites who use 
any excuse to degrade and beat back 
the Negro. It is peculiarly Pecksnif- 
fian to raise the fact that most prom- 
inent Negroes have been educated in 
separate schools, as an argument for 
separate schools. Most Negroes had to 
be educated in separate schools or not 
be educated at all since for a hundred 
years more than 9/10 of them were 
offered “Jim-crow”’ schools or nothing. 
It is obvious that the well-known and 
magnificent Negro high schools of Bal- 
timore and Washington send out a 
much larger proportion of well-trained 
Negro graduates than the Negro-bait- 
ing mixed high schools of a hundred 
different Northern cities. But Mer- 
ciful God! is this an argument for 
segregation, or against discrimination, 
cruelty, cheating and hate on the part 
of white pupils, teachers and officials? 
If the success of the Dunbar High 
School is to be built on the lawless 
snobbery of Gary, what is American 
democracy headed for? The success 
of some separate Negro schools is a 
crushing indictment of hatred and prej- 
udice and not a demand for further 
segregation. 

If Negroes have done well in certain 
separate Negro schools, two specula- 


313 


tions arise: how much more might 
Negroes have done if all their sep- 
arate schools had been adequately 
equipped and taught; and further what 
might not the Negro pupil have done 
if without hurt or hindrance the whole 
educational opportunity of America 
had been open to him, without dis- 
crimination. 
The “Jim-Crow” School 

The well-equipped “Jim Crow” 
school is a rare exception. For the 
most part, such schools have been run 
on wretchedly inadequate resources; 
taught by ignorant teachers; housed in 
huts and dumps; and given just as lit- 
tle attention and supervision as the 
authorities dared give them. The dis- 
crimination against the separate Negro 
public schools in the United States is 
one of the most despicable and dis- 
gusting of the discriminations against 
this enslaved race and if Pechstein does 
not know this he is far more ignorant 
than we suspect. 

If he does know it and still advocates 
separate schools, he may believe that 
funds can be had to make Negro 
schools decent and that segregation 
really settles the problem of Negro 
pupils. But how can a man of even 
elementary mentality argue this? 
Segregation if logical would double the 
cost of schools in the South and it 
distinctly increases it in  Cincin- 
nati. Any proposal for separate 
Negro schools is in effect a demand for 
schools less well housed, less well sup- 
ported, less well-equipped and less well- 
supervised than the average public 
school. How can segregation by color 
settle the problem of the retardation 
of stupid pupils? Not even the wild- 
est Nordic claims that all Negroes are 
morons. If South Carolina spends 
$1.00 a year to educate.a colored 
child, when that child appears in the 
Cincinnati schools, he is bound to be 
backward. Mr. Pechstein proposes 
properly to give such children the spe- 
cial training which they need; but he 
does not stop here. He also proposes 
that into this special school shall go 
all colored children whether they are 
stupid or not! Now what is there that 
a purely Negro school can give back- 
ward Negro children which any school 
for the retarded cannot give them? 
And what can normal Negro children 
get in a Negro school that they cannot 
get in a mixed school? Everybody 
knows: everybody knows that a Cath- 
olic school differs from other schools 
by teaching catholicism in addition to 
the school curriculum; that a Young 
Ladies Finishing School teaches _re- 
fined snobbery and that a Negro school 
teaches race solidarity and race pride 
and (whether consciously or uncon- 
sciously) distrust of all white folks. 
Cf course the Negro school and the 


314 





Catholic school and the schools for the 
rich will have teachers more sympa- 
thetic to their propaganda but this is 
the damnation of democracy and the 
shame of the teaching profession and 
not the goal and ideal of the public 
schools. Have we come to the day 
when only cripples can teach cripples 
and when the only hope of the Chinese 
is to protect them from white teachers? 
Hypocrisy 

Naturally little or nothing of this 
is in the Pechstein mind. Here, delib- 
erately or gropingly, this mind goes 
Pecksnifian: Negroes can be best kept 
from too great and fast advance by 
segregating them into cheaper facili- 
ties and opportunities. They can be 
induced thus to commit hari-kari by 
subtle appeals to pride and poverty. 
After all black folk are no less stupid 
and avaricious than whites. Give 
them one extra fine public school such 
as the people of Cincinnati gave them, 
and the majority of Negroes will jump 
to receive it. It gives them their one 
opportunity to teach at home at good 
salaries; it gives them some chance to 
direct their own children’s education. 
The children themselves discover a 
school that welcomes and encourages 
them instead of sneering at them and 
kicking them out. But is this all? O, 
no! The Negro who comes through 
the Negro college and studies Negro 
history under black professors; the 
child who comes through the Negro 
school with Negro teachers, is going 
to grow up as a Negro and not as an 
American. He is going to hate and 
despise the civilization that enslaved 
him, and now insults him. He is go- 
ing to believe that the world of white 
folk is armed against the world of 
black folk, and that one of these days 
they are going to fight it out to the 
bitter end. He is going to demand 
more and more the power to equip 
himself for this fight. Segregation 
breeds segregation. If Negroes must 
have separate schools, they should have 
separate school officials, a separate 
school budget, and a separate system 
of text books. They should push on to 
more separation and more self-govern- 
ment in every line of life. They will 
more and more resent the intervention 
of white folk in their life and suspect 
their every motive. 

The logical end of racial segregation 
is Caste, Hate and War. 

Twelve million Americans, separate 
self-contained, increasingly powerful, 
increasingly race patriotic and suspi- 
cious will grow and expand in this 
land. And this is the thing that the 
University of Cincinnati, in the per- 
son of one of its scientific leaders, sets 
before the world of 1929, as the solu- 
tion of the problem of the American 
citizens of Negro descent! 





MONEY FOR EDUCATION 
To the Honorable R. L. Wilbur, Sec- 


retary of the Interior: 
Sir: 

You are asking an advisory Commit- 
tee of Education to study the present 
relations of the Federal Government 
to education, and recommend a future 
program. One group will consider the 
educational activities of the United 
States Government, their administra- 
tion and future. A second group, will 
consider United States aid to colleges, 
and a third group, United States aid to 
primary and secondary education, Of 
the 45 persons appointed, not a single 
Negro appears, although in justice to 
their number and educational needs, at 
least 4 colored men and women ought 
to sit. The white South is liberally 
over-represented by at least 12 mem- 
bers of the Advisory Committee. 


It is, Sir, well-known that the Amer- 
ican Negro is openly, frankly and ruth- 
lessly discriminated against today: 

1. In the distribution of Land Grant 
Funds, 


2. In the distribution of the Smith- 
Lever and Smith- Hughes Funds, 


3. In all other Federal Government 
appropriations for education, 


4. In appropriations in numerous 
states, for public schools. 


In the name, therefore, of 12 mil- 
lion Americans, may we ask you to in- 
duce your Committee: 


1. To ascertain the exact figures as 
to the distribution of Federal Govern- 
ment funds among white and black 


children. 


2. To ascertain the exact distribution 
of state educational funds among black 
and white children. 

3. To make recommendations for 
further, more just distribution of 
United States Government funds to 
those states only which adopt methods 
of recording disbursements that are 
adapted clearly to reveal all allotments 
made by and within said states for the 
education of children of the races 
respectively ; thus permitting the whole 
people whose taxes make possible the 
educational work of this Republic, to 
know in future exactly where, in the 
field of education, that part of their 
money does in fact go. Under condi- 
tions as they now exist this question 
cannot be answered. 

We beg, Sir, that in such inquiries 
colored people be consulted and their 
advice followed. 


In behalf of the Education 
Committee of the Board of 
Directors of the National 
Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People.

(Continued from page 297) 


and gesticulating like mad the women 
passed, but she neither heard nor saw 
them. Over the high stone walls, Bou- 
gainville, jasmine and bois lette show- 
ered her with perfume but she was not 
conscious of it. Nude street urchins 
hurled vile epithets at her, calling her 
“chein Russiane,” but she did not hear 
them. A “high yellow” passed in his 
automobile, his driver honking loudly, 
but she was not aware of it; and he was 
obliged to drive around her. Up, up, 
up the steep, dusty street she climbed ; 
a greater horror in her heart than she 
had ever known. Her one thought, 
that she must convey the poison to her 
son and return. 

That gypsy king, the trade wind 
breathed softly through the white city 
by the dark blue Caribbean Sea, glit- 
tering and smooth under the afternoon 
sun. White-sailed fishing craft were 
wafted slowly over the silvery blue 
Gulf of Gonaives, to be seen in the dis- 
tance. A steamboat’s whistle sounded 
its hour of departure. Up, up, through 
the hot street she hurried, blind and 
deaf to it all. To the gods of the sea 
and the land and the sweeping winds 
that were talking to her, from far away 
they were talking to her of a veil in 
the meeting of winds; of leaf shadows 
through jungle dusk ; of cobweb threads 
of sound, subtly enchanting; of tree 
bells’ silvery tinkle, lovely, elusive. As 
a flash through the dark she saw only 
her son. 

She submitted mechanically to the 
search of the guards, scarcely conscious 
of it. At sight of her son, her courage 
almost failed her, but his relief when 
she whispered to him of the poison re- 
stored her confidence, and strengthened 
her will. Her weary eyes devoured his 
loved face. 

“It is better this way,” she told him, 
“we will cheat death of its greatest 
sting. We will be spared the greater 
shame and the terrible torture, for this 
death will be quick and painless.” 

“God bless you, little mother,” he 
whispered as she kissed goodby and 
passed him the tiny tube. She was 
fiercely tempted to tell him all and both 
swallow the poison immediately, but— 
she followed Soulouque’s instructions. 

A servant showed her into the beau- 
tiful room upon her return and served 
her a delicious dinner while she sat and 
waited. She did not taste of the food,

but sat as if turned into a lovely marble 
statue. Hour after hour passed. At 
times thoughts raced through her mind. 
Again time passed without registering 
on her numbed brain. Doubts of this 
mysterious Papaloi assailed her. What 
if he should betray her to the Govern- 
ment officials, who would take delight 
in shaming her, torturing both her and 
her son. But the hidious night finally 
passed. Soon the east began to glow 
softly pink. A sound came from an 
opening door but she did not glance up 
as foot-steps moved toward her. Some- 
one stood before her; she raised her 
eyes, then suddenly sprang to her feet. 

“Mother, mother, dearest mother,” 
her son exclaimed and caught her 
wavering form and held her to him. 

“Mother, mother, mother,” he 
crooned, half sung to her, “you are the 
most wonderful little mother in all the 
world.” 

“Yes,” said Soulouque, who now en- 
tered smiling, “and the most wonder- 
ful woman in all the world. Had you 
been tempted to take the other tube 
of poison after your promise to return, 
you both would have been buried alive 
and I would have left your son to die, 
but you I would have resuscitated.

You returned, and the drug which. does 
not kill but causes suspended anima- 
tion, has been the means of restoring 
‘our son to you.” 

The lady shuddered, horror fighting 
with the great joy in her heart as 
Soulouque continued : 

“I demanded his body in your name 
and restored him to life. You may 
both remain here until such time as you 
can be safely smuggled out of the coun- 
try. I wish you great happiness, 
Madame, very great happiness,” smiled 
Soulouque. 

“You have brought me the greatest 
possible happiness,” said the beautiful 
lady whom—Soulouque -no longer de- 
sired. 

A dagger of beauty, a dagger of pain 
had opened the seal of his soul— 
through the age long humming of the 
reef, through the swelling diapson of 
the surf; the sea drew down the beach 
with its fairy bells; the topaz fire of 
full sun blazoned the royal palms, 
chosen emblem of his country, standing 
on the rim of the sun-jeweled sea, 
swaying and whispering a little song 
when the winds held them and caressed 
them with breaths in which is balm. 
Through the red-flowered branches of 
the coral trees life smiled and beckoned, 
beckoned and smiled in witchery and 
wonder.

TUSKEGEE INSTITUTE, ALABAMA 








The Knickerbocker Press of Albany 
says “that Mrs. Hoover has behaved 
with a calm dignity that might have 
been expected of her. She has refused 
to pay any attention to telegrams of 
protest.” 

The Bristol, Ct., Press says: “The 
sight of Texas and Florida disciplining 
Mrs. Herbert Hoover for her cop. 
sideration shown the attractive wife of 
the only Negro member of Congress jg 
enough to arouse contempt and other 
emotions.” 


The Woonsocket, R. I., Call: “The 
color line is drawn too often and too 
easily. It is high time that the South, 
as well as other sections of the country, 
got away from this un-American atti- 
tude which, after all, is nothing more 
or less than a state of mind. We trust 
that Mrs. Hoover will again invite 
Mrs. DePriest to a White House tea 
if she sees fit and we hope that the lady 
will do just as she did before: accept 
the invitation. Mrs. Hoover, always 
a charming hostess, has done nothing 
of which she need feel ashamed or noth- 
ing for which she is called upon to 
offer any excuse or apology, the hot- 
headed South to the contrary.” 

Foreign papers like the English 
Manchester Guardian are mystified: 

“What was Mrs. Hoover to do 
about Mrs. DePriest? It would seem 
pretty obvious that she could not make 
an exception of this lady. So she was 
invited to tea with the rest. This 
simple, inevitable social courtesy has 
shocked a great many people in the 
States. The South, we are told, is 
thrown into a tumult about it, and 
State Legislatures are passing resolu- 
tions condemning Mrs. Hoover’s con- 
duct.” 


There is naturally a great deal of 
discussion of “Social Equality”. The 
Toccoa, Ga., Record: ‘What the 
Southern white people oppose is the 
intermingling of the white and black 
people in purely social life. This they 
object to however successful in_politi- 
cal and business life certain colored peo- 
ple may be and the number who will be 
thus successful will no doubt increase 
and if the principle that political or 
financial status determines social status 
is admitted and applied widely, what 
Mrs. Hoover has begun at the White 
House will soon be frequently seen. In 
fact the DePriest incident may easily 
become the incipiency and partly the 
cause of a social revolution as to this 
matter the results of which cannot be 
regarded with complacency by the 
Southern white people.” 

The Palm Beach, Fla., Independent 
is flat-footed. 

“T am going to settle this Nigger So- 
cial Equality Business right now.

. September, 


Here is the UNANSWERABLE 
and IRREFUTABLE argument. 

It was never intended that the Negro 
should be the social equal of the white 


an. 
"IT NEVER HAS, IS NOT NOW, 
AND NEVER WILL BE. THAT 
MASTER AND SERVANT WILL 
BE EQUAL ON A _ SOCIAL 
PLANE. THAT’S THAT. 

In Holy Writ the ninth chapter of 
Genesis and the twenty-fifth to twenty- 
seventh verses inclusive, one will read: 

“AND HE SAID? CURSED BE 
CANAAN A SERVANT OF 
SERVANTS SHALL HE BE UN- 
TO HIS BRETHREN. 

“AND HE SAID, BLESSED BE 
THE LORD GOD OF SHEM; 
AND CANAAN SHALL BE HIS 
SERVANT. 

“GOD SHALL ENLARGE JA- 
PHETH, AND HE SHALL 
DWELL IN THE TENTS OF 
SHEM; AND CANAAN SHALL 
BE HIS SERVANT.” 

“This may be CONFUSING to the 
average reader but when it is under- 
stood that Canaan was Ham’s son it’s 
easy to figure out why the curse was 
put on HAM’S BAD BOY and his 
progeny. 

“Tt is also easy to figure that, on 
down through the world’s history, the 
Negroes of today are direct descendants 
of Ham and Canaan.” 


The Bristol, Va., Herald-Courier 
strikes a different note: 

“DePriest is a Negro and one can 
scarcely blame him for resenting the 
criticism of Mrs. Hoover’s action in 
entertaining his wife at a White House 
tea. But, while characterizing these 
Southern critics as cowards, he should 
not overlook the hypocrisy of his white 
Republican friends in the North, who 
are his friends for political purposes 
only, and while professing much con- 
cern over the alleged wrongs suffered 
by his race in the South, are no more 
ready to recognize him as their social 
equal than are his white Democratic 
friends on this side of the Mason Dixon 
Line. And how much sincerity is there 
in the Republican talk of equal political 
rights for the Negro?” 

The liberal South is up a tree and 
almost silent. For instance the Eliza- 
beth City, N. C., Independent, takes 
cheap refuge in anger because Mr. De- 
Priest did not “maintain a dignified 
and respectful silence,” and breaks its 
own silence by calling him an “ugly 
gorilla!” 

The High Point, N. C., Enterprise 
lets in one interesting gleam of light. 

“The equality of citizenship, repre- 
sented by a fuller participation in gov- 
ernment, will arrive with the educa-

wherein he will not endanger the white

guard those institutions in the future as 
it has in the past but ultimately it will 
insinuate into the decision a term more

‘social equality’.” 


The August Parliaments 
(Continued from page 300) 


1928 and a second meeting this year. 
The temporary officers are: Charles S. 
Duke of Chicago, President; and E. 
R. Welsh of Howard University, Sec- 
retary. 

The fifth annual session of the Na- 
tional Bar Association entertained 
August | and 2 in the city of Detroit, 
Michigan, by the Harlan Law Club 
of that city was most interesting and 
informative. 

Able addresses were made by C. 
Francis. Stratford, of the Chicago 
Bar who was president of the Asso- 
ciation and Judge James A. Cobb, of 
Washington, D. C. These addresses 
aiong with those of William H. 
Haynes of the Chicago Bar, Raymond 
Pace Alexander of the Philadelphia 
Bar, would have done honor to the 
American Bar Association—and by 
the way, the National Bar Association 
came into existence because the latter 
organization for sometime past has 
usually refused to admit Negro at- 
torneys to membership. 
mass meeting was held at the Second 
Baptist Church, Rev. R. L. Bradby 
pastor, and was addressed by Judge 
Albert B. George, of Chicago. 

The sixth annual session will be 
held at Washington, D. C. The of- 
ficers for the ensuing year will be: 
Raymond Pace Alexander, President, 
Philadelphia Bar; Irvin C. Mollison, 
Secretary, Chicago Bar; Percival R. 
Piper, Treasurer, Detroit Bar. 


The Restaurant 
(Continued from page 301) 

“Why do you raise so many gui- 
neas?” I asked. “They are very cheap 
and very fast layers,” and then, with a 
twinkle in ‘her eye, Mrs. Howard 
added, “and breast of guinea when 
properly prepared can scarcely be dis- 
tinguished from chicken.” 

“How many chickens do you kill

and serve a month?” was my next que. 
tion. “The demand changes with the 
season, but we total for the year an 
average of one hundred twenty chickens 
a week for our restaurant.” 

When we had returned to the res. 
taurant to resume our conversation, | 
asked Mrs. Howard about her white 
customers. At first she hesitated to re. 
ply, but finally, she said, “We do not 
solicit white customers, but they come, 
At first we were not sure about serving 
them here in the restaurant, but my 
lawyer looked up the matter at my re. 
quest and found that I could. Hovw- 
ever, they create a problem here in the 
South, and we have decided to screen 
them off when they come in_ because 
our colored customers object to eating 
with them.” 

On Thursday evening, May 17, the 
Howard Restaurant, Number Two, 
was formally opened. This place 
which is closer in, will take care of the 
box lunches, short orders, and quick 
lunches for students; while the regu- 
lar customers and special dinner par- 
ties will continue to be served at the 
place “‘too far out.” 

The something “plus” which has 
made this business a success in spite of 
its location are, in my opinion: 

(a) Mrs. Howard’s superior knowl- 
edge of and experience in her business, 
and her willingness to make any reason- 
able sacrifice to please and satisfy her 
customers. 

(b) Captain Howard’s fine team 
work with his wife in producing the 
raw materials at minimum cost. 

Some men may walk a mile for a 
Camel cigarette, but any man would 
“walk a mile” for one of Mrs. How- 
ard’s chicken dinners in April or for 
one of her ’possum dinners in Novem-

Wooden beads that weighed him down, 
his long 

Thin fingers touching sacredly at last 

The crucifix. He slept to dream it filled 
his hearth 

Even as it had filled his empty life. 

The ebon shone like rose wood in the 
flame, 

The silver nails like suns that pierced his 


eyes 

Streaking the hollows in his face with 
light 

And as he watched he saw the silver

Drip, drip, drip, like falling stars 

And thorns like rush lights kindle on the

His soul too big to live, as fettered 

To his chair by ecstacy he thought 

Himself a waxen figure shaped by priest-

Melting to make a candle that would 
burn 

Forever on the mountain, lighting the 
world, 

The world that never would remember 
him. 

He smiled, wracked by the death of his 
one dream, 

As creeping by the door it had pushed

The hissing wind slipped under red gold

To sleep, as ashes slept around the brand 

That fell to kiss the hem of the monk’s

The Present South 
(Continued from page 303) 


fine colored women, one a_ school 
teacher, were held up on the road be- 
tween Murfreesboro and Nashville and 
raped. A white man acted as witness 
for them and our branch in Nashville 
prosecuted. But Tennessee has no in- 
termediate punishment for rape—it’s 
death or acquittal. And it would not 
do for a jury to send a white man to 
the electric chair for raping Negro 
women. So the jury acquitted them. 
They were then rearrested and charged 
with having liquor in their car and sen- 
tenced to the chain gang. Thus the 
conscience of white justice in Tennessee 
was salved. 

Up in Rome, Ga., a little colored 
boy of eight and a little white girl of 
seven were playing together. It began 
to rain and the children ran into an 
open church for shelter. A timid and 
suspicious Negro janitor saw them and 
called a policeman. This guardian of 
the law knew things criminal must be 
going on when a black boy dared to 
play with a white girl. He arrested the 
boy and charged him with rape. There 
Was no evidence of anything wrong— 
but nevertheless the colored boy was 


September, 1929 


sentenced to the reformatory until he 
shall be twenty-one years of age. 


This is a black picture but there is 
another side. Here and there white 
citizens are protesting and acting 
against these injustices. In the coun- 
try side countless atrocities occur of 
which the world never hears. Negroes 
dare not speak. But now and then as 
in the case at Eros, La., white men both 
speak and act. Their numbers steadily 
increase. Added to these are the new 
whites of the South we find occupying 
some of the chairs in the universities 
and colleges and the great number of 
southern white college students who 
have come to the light as the result of 
the interracial conferences in colleges. 
Many of these have thrown on the 
scrap heap the traditional views of the 
white south as to race relations. Down 
in a college center in Tennessee white 
and colored college students met regu- 
larly, ate, drank, discussed and played 
together—even to the extent of dancing 
until a nasty newspaper article fright- 
ened the authorities in their schools. I 
know Southern whites who are as much 
at home teaching in Negro schools as 
any of their colored colleagues and just 
as free in their relations. I know south- 
ern whites who have given up father, 
mother, home and hopes of inheritance, 
in order to cling to their beliefs, that 
men and women are to be made com- 
rades on the basis of congeniality re- 
gardless of color, ‘“My father died in 
my arms without forgiving me,” said 
one of these to me, “‘because of my posi- 
tion on race matters but I am happy, 


for I have found something worthwhile 


in life.” 


And the number of these is increas- 
ing in geometrical ratio. The Uni- 
versity of Georgia admits colored stu- 
dents to its summer school now and’ 
gives them full credit towards a degree 
for the work done. In certain places 
one finds anomalies that astonish. I 
stopped with a Negro physician in a 
town in central Georgia whose prac- 
tice was sixty per cent white. He was 
called into white homes to deliver chil- 
dren without any fear of public opinion 
or any hesi.ancy. Yet his brown face 
clearly evidenced his race to the most 
casual observer. In this same town, I 
was told of a remarkably queer situa- 
tion. On its outskirts a Negro trusty 
ran a store for both races. The only 
objection his white neighbors had to 
him was that this convict trusty dressed 
in the height of fashion and wore spats! 

The most hopeful thing in the South, 
however, is the growing realization of 
colored people that without organiza- 
tion destined to mould public opinion, 
to modify laws and to gain justice in 
courts and safety of life, limb and prop- 
erty, Negroes can have no freedom nor

ending of danger. If they get wealth 
they will be only rich serfs. 

Along with this is the rapidly spread- 
ing conviction that a voteless people 
must be a powerless people. Birming- 
ham has nearly eighty thousand Ne- 
groes. Not 300 vote. Registrars crossly 
refuse them. Few persist in their at- 
tempts to register or insist. 

Mobile has thirty thousand Negroes 
and only one hundred fifty-five vote. 
And this is indicative of the entire 
South with the exception of a few 
places. Nowhere in the South can be 
found a place where Negroes vote in 
representative numbers. Hence the 
judge whose office is not at all affected 
by the Negro vote often gives a colored 
boy ten years for an offense for which 
a white boy receives a sentence of one 
year. School boards whose tenure of 
office is not affected by Negro votes; 
police commissioners, sheriffs, town 
councils forget the rights and needs of 
Negroes because Negroes can do noth- 
ing towards putting them in or casting 
them out. Segregation ordinances would 
seldom have to be fought in courts at 
large costs if Negroes voted and could 
defeat ‘councilmen who favored such 
ordinances. Where Negroes vote in 
any ftiumbers, paving, lighting and 
sewerage in their districts improve, 
schools become better, justice more fre- 
quent. The South would be trans- 
formed if Negroes would organize to 
secure the ballot and use it to vote for 
friends of the race and against it ene- 
mies. They would have to fight for a 
while in courts. In some instances they 
would at times have to run certain 
physical risks. But if freedom is worth- 
while, what are risks? And here is one 
way to freedom for the Negro in the 


South. 


In the past, the dyed-in-the-wool Re- 
publican Negro leaders, often profes- 
sional politicians, have guided them into 
a morass. The Republican party has 
been the party of blacks and the Demo- 
cratic, that of whites. Hence whites 
have had corruption, robbery, and 
demagoguery and the blacks have been 
holding to a shadow. When Negroes 
in the South vote for friends without 
regard to party, the South will become 
normal in its political status—a two 
party region. When a sufficient num- 
ber of Negroes are Democrats, it will 


become respectable for whites to be Re- 
publicans, for both parties will contain 
both races. The obvious reason why, in 
municipal and state politics, Negroes in 
the South should vote in the Demo- 
cratic primary and election was well 
expressed by my friend who said to me: 
“No one can be elected here except a 
Democrat. A Republican has just as 
much chance to be elected here as a 
celluloid cat would have in an attempt 


322 


to catch an asbestos mouse in hell. We 
mean to support the most friendly 
Democrat, and if he fails us, we will do 
our best to put him out.”” When Ne- 
groes everywhere in the South realize 
this and act upon it a new day will 
come for whites and blacks in that 
region.

accounting, and educational guidance, 
which are supplementary to each other. 
Every step of intelligent educational 
guidance must be based on accurate and 
scientific personnel accounting; and un- 
less educational accounting eventuates 
in the proper guidance of students it is 
wasteful and useless. It is the purpose 
of the Deans and Registrars. Associa- 
tion to so correlate and coordinate their 
work that these larger aims may be re- 
alized. 


The last meeting of the Associa- 
tion was held at Prairie View State 
College, at which time a discussion of 
many of the studies begun and pre- 
sented at previous meetings was con- 
tinued. The following are some of 
the topics that were discussed at this 
meeting: Orientation of College Stu- 
dents; A Cooperative Testing Pro- 
gram; Supervision of College Teach- 
ing; Statistical Information in the 
Registrar’s office and suitable Forms; 
Teacher Training in Negro Colleges; 
Tendencies in College and _ Profes- 
fessional Education; Agricultural and 
Technical Curricula. 

The Association is desirous of 
cooperating with all existing educa- 
tional organizations; and to this end it 
plans to propose a cooperative program 
to the National Association of Teach- 
ers in Colored Schools; The Associa- 
tion of Colleges for Negro Youth; and 
to the various state educational associa- 
tions. 


Wisdom from Africa 
(Continued from page 307) 


before you can try him’.’ “Where 
death lives, there we take long life.” 
One must not be afraid to do something 
dangerous; a person must be willing to 
sacrifice, for is he not a human being, 
and does he not have all of the dignity 
of humanity? This is one of the fun- 
damental philosophical attitudes of the 
Kru, and that Mr. Tagbwe lived ac- 
cording to it is only another indication 
of his complete loyalty to his people in 
Africa. 

It might perhaps be well to end with 
a saying that shows the realistic posi- 


tion which these people hold toward 
life. To live too long, they feel, is not 
good. After all, a man who is too old 
is a burden, he must be cared for, he 
cannot help the community, and his 
wisdom is in a state of decay. Why 
does he wish to live? He is an “old 
broken pot by the fireside”,—why does 
he hang on? Is he looking for eternal 
life? For eternal goodness? Even if 
he finds it, will he not be too old to en- 
joy it? “When we see an old man who 
finds the world too good to leave, we 
say, ‘You will never find the eternally 
good world, for you will be an old 
broken pot by the fireside by then’.” 

Sie Tagbwe was about forty years 
of age when he died. And that he 
should leave these proverbs as a memo- 
rial to show us in America the fineness 
of his people’s thought and its philoso- 
phical depth is something that would 
have been in accord with his dearest 
wish.

@ In Sierra Leone, British West 
Africa, Alfred James Shorunkeh-Saw- 
yerr, O.B.E., J.P., is dead at Freetown. 
He was born in 1860, educated at Free- 
town and in England, and was called 
to the bar in 1889 where he was a lead- 
ing lawyer, becoming a Justice of the 
Peace and Visiting Justice. Since 1911, 
he has been a nominated member of the 
Legislative Council. He was a man of 
courage and wide influence. His 
brother, John, died 11 days later. He 
was educated in South Africa and in 
England and was a lawyer and book 
seller. He took little part in public 
life. 

@ The Natives of Durban, South 
Africa, have tried to boycott beer 
brewed by white men. One Native 
constable defied the boycott, and the re- 
sult was a riot in which one European 
and five Natives were killed, and fifty 
natives and several Europeans injured.
