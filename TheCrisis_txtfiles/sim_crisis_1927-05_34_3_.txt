Gentlemen : 


I have been practicing medicine for twenty-three years in the city of Peters- 
burg. My practice has been extensive, covering all of the adjacent counties, and I 
have yet to hear anything other than praise for the Southern Aid Society of Va.. 
Inc. 

It seems that the Society has adopted as its policy, “Service to its patrons”. I 
know of none that settles its claims more promptly. The Society is undoubtedly 


a tremendous force in the relief of distress within our group. 


Very truly yours, 
( Signed ) Ropert E. Burton, M.D.

THE Crisis 











HEN a colored boy starts to 
study, the possibilities before 
him seem rather limited. If 


he can study long enough, he can be a 
physician or a dentist and begin to 
make an income shortly after his sign 
is hung out. If he wants to take law, 
he must be able to wait longer for the 
starving period to pass. His chance in 
the ministry is peculiar: first, there i; 
the difficult question of what he believe 
and what he doesn’t believe; and of 
tle comparatively small salaries paid by 
most churches and the moving about. 
Business may attract him. But where 
is he going to get capital? There is a 
chance in farming, but there is the diff- 
culty also of Southern rural life and 
the lonesomeness of the farm, north 
and south. 

All these things the young man con- 
siders who has a chance for study. But 
suppose he has no chance to study? 
Suppose, like Paul E. Johnson of Chi- 
cago, he is thrown at the early age of 
fourteen into the midst of life. Us- 
ually it happens that such a boy land; 
in the kind of a job which leaves him 
stranded as he grows up. He is a jan- 
itor, errand boy, porter or bootblack 
and as he approaches manhood he finds 
nothing new opened up to him. Paul 
E. Johnson was born in Atlanta, 
Georgia, July 26th, 1892, and received 
a common ‘grade school education in 
that city. He came to Chicago at the 
aze of fourteen years. After coming 
to Chicago, he secured a position as 
office boy for the Charles H. Killough 
Company whose business it was to re- 
ceive the medical outfits in physicians’ 
offices in exchange for new ones. These 
worn-out outfits were brought to the 
office and repaired. Johnson swept the 
offices, cleaned them, carried in the old 
machines, stored them and took them 
apart. He watched while they were be- 
ing repaired. Finally, he did some of 
the repairing. Then he bean to learn 
so much about it that he did all of it; 
but he was still a porter at a porter’s 
wages. That was all that was offered 
him. There was no chance for promo- 
tion. Fhe firm was sorry. They ap- 
vreciated his work, but,—“you know 
how it is”, they said. Johnson was dis- 
satisfied. He got an idea that his 
knowledge of these medical outfits was 
a valuable thing. Also he learned 
something about electricity. He learned 
a great deal about skilled mechanical 
work of various sorts. 


INALLY HE left this firm, walked 
across the hall to the John Mc- 
Intosh Company and offered to renair

end of the deal. for two years, then 
tendered his resignation because the 
John Melntosh Company did not fill 
theirs. Instead of accepting his resig- 
nation a new proposition was made 
him. For this he was to receive a sal- 


Paul E. Johnson 


medical outfits and to train people who 
could repair them, on condition that he 
be given a chance to act as salesman. 
Now the new firm recognized his skill 
and knowledge and they wanted to use 
it, but, of course, they didn’t want any 
colored salesman. Nevertheless it was 
worth while making an apparent deal. 
Mr. Johnson was taken. He filled his 


ary of $17.50 per week in wages and 
train repairers and do other work and 
to sell $175.00 worth of goods each 
week. If he got over this amount he 
was to get a commission. He took off 
his coat and sailed in and he sold more 
than $175.00 worth of goods each 
week. But complaints came in and the 
firm did not look with good will upon 


77 


the training of a colored man for this 
particular job and they took away his 
sales opportunity. About this time, due 
to race prejudice, his brother got into 
trouble. The National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People 
took up the case. Paul helped with his 
few savings to defend the brother. For 
a while it looked as though his chance 
for rising and promotion was gone. But 
realizing that his brother’s fight would 
be a long one he started out again, got 
a position with his former employer, 
Charles H. Killough, who created an 
Electric Therapy Department and 
made Paul head of it. At this time 
he began to study and read, particu- 
larly about the application of electricity 
in medicine. He became intensely in- 
terested in the work that was being 
done with electric light for the cure 
of disease. After Paul had been with 
Mr. Killough for a while, he left due 


te a little disagreement about the meth- * 


ods Paul was to use in the management 
of his department. After leaving Mr. 
Killough’s, Paul went into business for 
himself along the Electric Therapy line. 


OING A general business in new 

and second hand equipment at first, 
Paul eventually got the Chicago repre- 
sentation for a German Therapeutic 
Lamp (using the mail in his negotia- 
tions as letters don’t tell one’s color). 
After two years as their Mid-Western 
Manager, knowing if he didn’t present 
himself someone would very likely make 
his racial identity known, feeling he 
would rather do it and face the music 
than remain under the strain of the 
possibility of sudden discharge, Paul 
went to the American office of this 
concern at Newark, N. J. He wasn’t 
discharged, neither was he given the 
contract that his record entitled him 
to, so he resolved to build a lamp of 
his own. An investigation revealed a 
Mercury Arc in Quartz used for water 
sterilization made by the General Elec- 
tric Company which could with modi- 
fications be used in the Therapeutic 
Lamp that Johnson was building. He 
approached the General Electric Com- 
pany with a proposition. He told them 
that he had found a new use for their 
Quartz burner and if they would give 
him the exclusive right of buying and 
using it, in that way, he would in- 
corporate it in his lamp. The manager 
whom he consulted w:s agreeable and 
told him to go ahead. Paul John- 
scn went ahead. He developed his 
lamp and when the General Electric 
Company investigated and found out 
how much money could be made off of 
this particular lamp, thev refused to fill 
his orders for Quartz burners. He 
went to talk with them and to find out 
just why they would not fill his orders. 
This conference was participated in by 
the Sales Manager, the Director of Re- 


78 


search, his first and second assistants, 
the firm attorney, two branch managers 
and the President, Mr. Evans. Mr. 
Evans said that the manager who had 
given him the exclusive contract had 
gone beyond his power. They had 
Johnson there, as he had no written 
contract. They had made a verbal con- 
tract, only. “Very well,” said Mr. 
Johnson, “will you allow me to keep 
on buying the burners on the same 
terms as you allow other people?” ‘““We 
will,” said Mr. Evans. Notwithstand- 
ing this, a little while later an order 
for Quartz Burners which he sent in 
was turned down. He secured the in- 
terest of Dr. I. A. Gardner who offered 
to back him to the extent of $50,000 


Mrs. Paul Johnson, Granddaughter of the 
Hon. Walter Cohen 


to be used in buying Quartz Burners 
and other equipment. Even after 
hearing that he had the backing of this 
man the General Electric Company re- 
fused to sell to him. He then secured 
the interest of Mr. E. J. Rose who 
called on the General Electric Com- 
pany, the Chicago Office, offering to 
back Tohnson up to the amount of 
$500,000. Still they refused to sell 
Johnson on any terms. 

Most people under such circumstan- 
ces would have thrown up their hands 
and said that when a tremendous trust 
like the General Electric Company 
worth $2,000,000,000 and at that time 
controlling the making of Quartz 
Burners in the United States, when 
they started in to fight one poor col- 
ored man, there is nothing for that 
man to do but go out of business. But 


not so with Paul Johnson. He 
jumped on a boat and went to Ger- 
many. He secured there the right to 
use certain patents and lamps which 
he needed. He came back to the Unit- 
ed States and proceeded to equip a 
manufacturing plant and again he was 
in trouble. The Trade Unions in the 
business of Electricity and other lines, 
did not recognize him and would not 
admit him into their Unions. If he 
wanted to hire men, he had to hire 
white men and they would refuse to 
take any colored apprentices or admit 
them into the Union. Johnson, him- 
self, could not be the only workman. 
Again Mr. Johnson got into the fray. 
By various methods he secured foreign 
working men for the various processes 
of making the lamp, of making the 
standards, of putting the finish of japan 
and nickel upon them, of casting the 
iron; all of the various kinds of me- 
chanical work that go into the making 
of his many “Universal” Lamps, 
which he is now manufacturing. Mr. 
Johnson now has colored and white 
men working in his shop and they are 
all on amicable terms. To-day, if you 
are curious, you may go to 1824-30 
South Albert Street, Chicago, and see 
these men at work and the Lamps be- 
ing manufactured. There is scarcely 
a city in the United States where you 
cannot see one of Paul E. Johnson’s 
Lamps in use. 


E IS manufacturing to-day forty- 

five different articles, ranging in 
price from $1.25 for a blue bulb to over 
$1,000 for the Spectro-Sun Solarum. 
He manufactures protective screens, 
generators, bulbs, beauty lamps, 
chromo-therapy lamps, nurse’s lamps, 
deep therapy lamps, Spectro Sun Car- 
bon Arc Lamps, mercury quartz com- 
bination lamps, nasal applicators and 
incandescent lamps, etc. To-day his 
lamps are being used in the Cook 
County Hospital, The Augustana Hos- 
pital, Northwestern University Medi- 
cal School, Rush Medical College, 
Illinois Charitable Eye and Ear In- 
firmary, North Chicago Hospital, Wes-

are in India, China, Australia, South 
America, Mexico, France and Canada. 
Not only that, but Mr. Johnson is

avy. His advertisements say:

N the September and December, 
| 1926, numbers of THE Crisis we 

published reports on the Negro 
common schools of Georgia and Missis- 
sippi. As stated in those reports, the 
investigation upon which they were 
based was paid for by a five thousand 
dollar appropriation from the Amer- 
ican Fund for Public Service. Four 
thousand dollars of this Fund was ex- 
pended in the work of investigation and 
one thousand went to pay the extra 
expense of publishing these reports in 
enlarged numbers of THe Crisis. The 
publication of further studies has no 
financial support and therefore the 
studies must be issued in curtailed form 
without an exhaustive presentation of 
facts and figures. On the other hand, 
in this shorter form they will be per- 
haps more readable. 


NORTH CAROLINA 


HE present study covers the state © 


of North Carolina and is much 
more pleasant reading than the two 
former reports. Georgia, Mississippi 
and Alabama reach probably the nadir 
of public school education of Negroes. 
On the other hand, for the Southern 
states, North Carolina is without 
doubt the best. ‘This condition of the 
public schools in North Carolina is due 
to a slow but certain change of atti- 
tude in the public opinion of the state 
induced by the missionary work of a 
series. of far-sighted and public-spirited 
men. The change is not complete. 
The average North Carolina citizen 
does not yet thoroughly believe in edu- 
cation for Negroes. But perhaps the 
degree of change that has aireaay taken 
place can be best indicated by two 
quotations, In his biennial report of 
the public schools of North Carolina 
for 1908-09 and 1909-10, Superinten- 
dent J. Y. Joyner, a protagonist for 
education in the state, spoke of Negro 
schools as follows: 

“Tt would be easier and more pleas- 
ant for me to close this report without 
undertaking to discuss this most per- 
plexing problem of the education of 
the Negro, about which there are so 
many conflicting and divergent views 
among my people. This is a part, 
however, of the educational problem 
of the state and, in some respects, the 
most difficult part. It is, therefore, 
my duty to study it and to give to you 
and through you to the general as- 
sembly and to the people my honest 
views about it. He is a coward that 
basely runs away from a manifest duty.

Qe 





»- 


....« The Negro is here among us 
through no fault of his own and is 
likely to remain here. There are but 
two roads open to him. One is eleva- 
tion through the right sort of educa- 
tion; the other is deterioration and 
degradation through ignorance and 
miseducation, inevitably leading to ex- 
pulsion or extermination. We must 
help him into the first if we can. If 
we do not our race will pay the heavi- 
est penalty for the failure. 


cs . There is another phase of 
this problem of Negro education wor- 
thy of the serious consideration of our 
people. It is manifest to me that if 
the Negroes become convinced that 
they are to be deprived of their schools 
and of the opportunities of an educa- 
tion, most of the wisest and most self- 
respecting Negroes will leave the state 
and eventually there will be left here 
only the indolent, worthless and crim- 
inal part of the Negro population.” 

Joyner was *friend of Negro edu- 
cation, but in advocating it he had to 
be distinctly apologetic and base his 
advocacy upon the economic needs of 
the white men and not upon the Ne- 
groes’ needs per se. 


OURTEEN years later we have 

the report of A. T. Allen, State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
saying: 

“Negro education in North Caro- 
lina has been greatly stimulated with- 
in the last five years. The Division 
of Negro Education in the State De- 
partment has been able to give this ex- 
pansion wise direction and greatly to 
encourage our Negro population. It 
has also been instrumental in bringing 
about more amicable relations between 
the races and in restoring the confi- 
dence in each race in the good inten- 
tions of the other. There seems to be 
a disposition on the part of the people 
of the State to concede to the Negro 
an educational opportunity far more 
adequate than any he has heretofore 
enjoyed. The Negroes are accepting 
the privilege of going to school in good 
faith and are availing themselves of 
the opportunity in a most commend- 
able manner. The opportunity for the 


colored child to get an education is no- 
where equal to the opportunity offered 
to the white child, but the dividing 
gap between their opportunities is 
gradually being narrowed as the col- 
ored schools are improved.” 

Here the education of the Negro is 
assumed as an established policy and 
the Superintendent is even able to 
state that the difference between the 
educational opportunity of white chil- 
dren and Negro children is growing 
smaller and to hint that the goal is 
equal educational opportunity for all 
children regardless. of race. Not a 
single state Superintendent of Schools 
of any other former slave state, with 
the possible exception of Missouri, has 
ever cared to make a statement as lib- 
eral as this. But this is not all; there 
are people in North Carolina, and 
people of prominence, who go further 
than this. They do not dare yet to 
say openly all they believe, but one 
prominent North Carolinian writes to 
a colored man in December, 1926, ad- 
dressing him as “Mister” and in com- 
menting on a recently published study 
of Negro education says: 

“I read part of the study of Negro 
education by Mr. Huff last night. It 
was sad stuff, another case of half lit- 
erate whites working on the ‘Negro 
problem’. Mr. Huff’s thesis is that 
the Negro should be given education 
—always the attitude of ‘giving’—in 
order to make him a more efficient cog 
in the economic wheel. I think Mr. 
Huff's attitude is more or less repre- 
sentative of the so-called liberal white. 
There are not many—but there are 
some—who hold the view that every 
individual is or should be an end unto 
himself, that every individual regard- 
less of color, race, point of origin, 
should be given every opportunity to 
develop his powers of mind and body 
and take his place in society accord- 
ingly. When such work as this ‘study’ 
is approved and the author receives an 
A.M. on the basis of it—and this sort 
of work is not unusual—I wonder if 
we of the white race really have any- 
thing to boast about. Certainly, it 
will be no great strain on you people, 
once you can get the money, to form 
an educational system equal to ours. 
My humble advice to you would be to 
study some other pattern—ours, I 
think, is a rather crazy one.” 

All this does not mean that North 
Carolina is wholly in the light. It is 
only by contrast with the unrecon- 
structed South that she shines. There 
is still lawlessness; 14 Negroes have 


79 





been lynched in the last ten years; 
there is still a discouraging amount of 
ignorance and prejudice among the 
mass of the whites. One colored man, 
a tall, well-built Negro engaged in 
farming and social uplift, told me of 
his experiences in Columbus County in 
1922. He had tried to have a Negro 
school in the Chadbourne District 
where they had had no Negro public 
school for 57 years: The Negroes 
were required to give outside of their 
taxation two hundred fifty dollars for 
a schoolhouse. This amount was raised 
gradually until at last they actually 
paid one thousand six hundred and 
thirty dollars. He became a marked 
man for his persistence. And in addi- 
tion he successfully stopped a white 
man from profiteering to the extent of 
seven dollars a ton in selling lime to 
Negro farmers. Neighbors complained 
because his wife did not “take in wash- 
ing” and the Ku Klux Klan began to 
pay him attention. A mob took him 
one night out into the woods and 
horsewhipped him. Certainly, North 
Carolina is not out of the shadows, 
but she is one hundred years ahead of 
Georgia. 


POPULATION AND ENROLL- 
MENT 
HE Negro school population, en- 
rollment and the average daily 
attendance is shown in the following 
diagram. (Page 96) 

One sees not only how steadily these 
lines tend upward, but also that the 
daily attendance is becoming a larger 
and larger part of the enrollment and 
that the enrollment is approximating 
the school population. In the last ‘re- 
port available, 1923-24, out of a school 
population 5-20 years of age of 293,- 
183, 248,904 were enrolled in school 
and 164,698 were in daily attendance. 
Or, if we take the school population 
7-13 (compulsory school age) for the 
same year, we have 162,542, of which 
161,786 are enrolled in schools and of 
them 113,704 are in daily attendance.

THe Crisis 












S I boarded the train in the little 
A town of “X’’, going into a new 
field of labor, I found that 
there were no colored passengers except 
myself. After riding the distance of six 
miles | reached the junction where I 
had to change trains. * While waiting 
at the junction for the arrival of the 
late Virginian train, I was drawn into 
conversation by a white woman. She 
was of that type who proceeds without 
inducement to tell you just how many 
chickens she has raised, how many hogs 
she has to kill, how long she has ‘been 
married to “Bill”, how many children 
she has reared and how well they have 
married. The concluding remarks were 
abruptly hushed by the sound of the 
whistle of the approaching train heard 
in the distance. 


When the train arrived there were 
no passengers for this stop and we im- 
mediately got on. “The coaches were 
crowded. I found space in two seats. 
One held a foreigner, the other, a 
white American. The American said, 
“Share my seat”. I thanked him and 
sat down. As the train rolled on we 
noticed that the fruit trees were not 
heavy laden. He discussed the apple 
crops, saying they were plentiful in the 
State of Ohio. We then talked on and 
compared the States of Ohio and West 
Virginia. 

My garrulous co-traveler looked at 
us with anxious eyes and listened with 
eager ears. We now had reached sta- 
tion “L”’, the destination of the white 
American, who bowed politely saying, 
“Good-bye” and got off. 

The garrulous traveler asked if she 
might share the seat. I nodded yes, 
but my conversation with her was in 
monotones until we came to station 
“M”, where we again changed trains. 
From this station we walked down a 
long flight of steps, then crossed over 
tc a smaller station, where we waited 
for our next train on a short line. 

When the window of the ticket office 
opened and I purchased my ticket, I 
discovered that I had left my baggage 
at the station up the long flight of 
steps. The ‘co-traveler said, “You jest 
git my ticket fer me, and I’ll git yer 
grip.” She was much older than I, 
but I remembered days before ’63 and 
thought “Yes, let her carry it, since she 
had suggested it.” And she did. Thus 
time passed until the short line train 
came and we got on. 


FOUND a seat and she insisted on 
sitting with me again. Two other 
colored ladies took the seat just in 
front of us. My co-traveler whispered

“How Fair and White You Air!” 


to me, “I like to ride in Virginy where 
you are not bothered with niggers. | 
jest can’t stan’ ’em. Kin you?” 
Quickly I thought how much worse it 
would hurt her to ride with me and 
find her mistake farther on the journey. 
So I pleasantly replied. “Yes, I can 
stand them, in fact I am very fond 
of them.” With a horrified look she 


exclaimed, “You air!” “Well,” said 


she, “if they ride in separate cyars it 
will be more better for them and more 
better for us.” Seemingly this cruci- 
fying of the King’s English gave me an 
appetite and I guess she already had 
one, for we both opened our lunches 
and began to eat. 


She insisted on my eating some of 
her lunch and | purposely did. I gave 
her some of mine in exchange... We 
chatted about the wind and the weather 
until our lunches were exhausted. 
Then I asked if my face looked dirty 
from the long dusty ride. She said, 
“No indeedy. I was jest noticin’ how 
fair and white you air. I'd give most 
anything to be as white.” We were 
now at the end of the line, where we 
would change for the last time to the 
N. and W. main line. Here we 
would wait from 4:00 P. M. until 
7:00 P. M. We and a drummer 
constituted the waiting passengers. 

As we looked out of the station win- 
dow we saw an east-bound train com- 
ing in. Three distinguished Negroes 
descended the steps to the platform. 
Later they proved to be an Editor, a 
Lawyer and a Hotel Proprietor. It 
seemed that I knew one but I said 
nothing to her. They entered the sta- 
tion. 


HE Editor walked up to me and 

said courteously, “Good afternoon. 
Are you Miss ‘A’?” “Yes,” I an- 
swered, “I am she.” He took from his 
pocket a, photograph and continued. 
“Do you recognize this picture?” 
“Yes, it is myself,” I replied. The 
Editor then introduced the Lawyer and 
said, ““Your sister, Mrs. ‘W’, sent At- 
torney ‘C’ to meet you.”

HAT is believed to be a rec- 
\W ord was recently established 
by the N. A. A. C. P. in 


winning two important cases in the 
United States Supreme Court within 
a period of seven days. The first of 
these handed down on March 7th was 
a unanimous opinion in the Texas 
White Primary Case, Nixon v. Hern- 
don and Porras. ‘The other decision 
was gained in the New Orleans and 
Louisiana Residential Segregation 
Case, Tyler v. Harmon. 

The White Primary Case has re- 
ceived so much publicity in the edito- 
rial and news columns of the white 
and colored papers throughout the 
country that there is no need of enter- 
ing into a lengthy recital of the facts. 
Briefly, there was passed by the Texas 
State Legislature in 1923 an act bar- 
ring Negroes from voting in primaries 
of the Democratic Party. A reputable 
Negro physician of E] Paso, Dr. L. A. 
Nixon, a regularly enrolled member 
of the Democratic Party, attempted to 
vote at the primary election of July 
26, 1924, and was refused a ballot by 
the election judges, C. C. Herndon 
and Charles Porras. 

Suit for damages was filed against 
the election judges by Dr. Nixon, the 
El Paso Branch of the N. A. A. C. P. 
retaining attorneys for that purpose. 
The United States District Court of 
the Western District of Texas upheld 
the action of the election judges and 
appeal from that decision was immedi- 
ately taken to the United States Su- 
preme Court. The case was argued 
on January 5, 1927, in the Supreme 
Court by Fred C. Knollenberg of El 
Paso and Arthur B. Spingarn of New 
York, Chairman of the National Le- 
gal Committee of the N. A. A. C. P. 
Associated with these attorneys in the 
preparation of the brief were Moor- 
field Storey and James A. Cobb of 
Washington. ‘Later a reply brief was 
filed by the N. A. A. C. P. attorneys 
answering the brief of the State of 
Texas. In the preparation of this lat- 
ter brief Louis Marshall, eminent au- 
thority on constitutional law, member 
of the National Board and of the Na- 
tional Legal Committee of the N. A. 
A. C. P., was added to the formidable 
array of attorneys appearing for Dr. 
Nixon. 


N Monday, March 7, 1927, the 
United States Supreme Court 
was crowded, a large number of col- 
ored people being present expecting to

hear the argument of the Louisiana 
Segregation Case. Mr. Justice 
Holmes, on the eve of his eighty-sixth 
birthday, delivered the decision of the 
Court. Concise, straightforward and 
unequivocal were his words in declar- 
ing unconstitutional the attempt of the 
State of Texas to disfranchise Negro 
voters. Because of its importance not 
only in its effect upon the question of 
disfranchisement of Negroes but also 
because of its ruling that the primary 
is an integral part of the election proc- 
ess (thus affecting profoundly such is- 
sues as the Vare case in Pennsylvania 
and the Smith case in Illinois) the de- 
cision is reprinted here in its entirety: 

“Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the 
opinion of the Court. 

“This is an action against the Judges 
of Elections for refusing to permit the 
plaintiff to vote at a primary election 
in Texas. It lays the damages at five 
thousand dollars. The petition al- 
leges that the plaintiff is a Negro, a 
citizen of the United States and of 
Texas and a resident of El Paso and 
in every way qualified to vote, as set 
forth in detail, except that the statute 
to be mentioned interferes with his 
right; that on July 26, 1924, a pri- 
mary election was held at El Paso for 


the nomination of candidates for a sen- 


ator and representatives in Congress 
and State and other offices, upon the 
Democratic ticket; that the plaintiff, 
being a member of the Democratic 
party, sought to vote but was denied 
the right by defendants; that the de- 
nial was based upon a Statute of Texas 
enacted in May, 1923, and designated 
Article 3093a, by the words of which 
‘in no event shall a Negro be eligible 
to participate in a Democratic party 
primary election held in the State of 
Texas,’ etc., and that this statute is 
contrary to the Fourteenth and Fif- 
teenth Amendments to the Constitu- 
tion of the United States. The de- 
fendants moved to dismiss upon the 
ground that the subject matter of the 
suit was: political and not within the 
jurisdiction of the Court and that no 
violation of the Amendments was 
shown. The suit was dismissed and a 
writ of error was taken directly to this 
Court. Here no argument was made 









on behalf of the defendants but a brief 
was allowed to be filed by the Attor- 
ney General of the State. 

“The objection that the subject mat- 
ter of the suit is political is littie more 
than a play upon words. Of course 
the petition concerns political action 
but it alleges and seeks to recover for 
private damage. ‘That private damage 
may be caused by such political action 
and may be recovered for in a suit at 
law hardly has been doubted for over 
two hundred years, since Ashby v. 
White, 2 Ld. Raym. 938, 3id. 320, 
and has been recognized by this Court. 
Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U.S. 58, 64, 65. 
Giles v. Harris, 189 U. S. 475, 485. 
See also Judicial Code, section 24 
(11), (14). Act of March 3, 1911, 
c. 231; 36 Stat. 1087, 1092. If the 
defendants’ conduct was a wrong to 
the plaintiff the same reasons that al- 
low a recovery for denying the plain- 
tiff a vote at a final election allow it 
for denying a vote at the primary elec- 
tion that may determine the final re- 
sult. 

“The important question is whether 
the statute can be sustained. But al- 
though we state it as a question the 
answer does not seem to us open to a 
doubt. We find it unnecessary to con- 
sider the Fifteenth Amendment, be- 
cause it seems to us hard to imagine a 
more direct and obvious infringement 
of the Fourteenth. That Amendment, 
while it applies to all, was passed, as 
we know, with a special intent to pro- 
tect the blacks from discrimination 
against them. Slaughter House Cases, 
16 Wall. 36. Strauder v. West Vir- 
ginia, 100 U. S. 303. That Amend- 
ment ‘not only gave citizenship and the 
privileges of citizenship to persons of 
color, but it denied to any State the 
power to withhold from them the equal 
protection of the laws. .. . What is this 
but declaring that the law in the 
States shall be the same for the black 
as for the white; that all persons, 
whether colored or white, shall stand 
equal before the laws of the States 
and, in regard to the colored race, for 
whose protection the amendment was 
primarily designed, that no discrimina- 
tion shall be made against them by law 
because of their color?’ Quoted from 
the last case in Buchanan v. Warley, 
245 U. S. 60, 77. See Yick Wo v. 
Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 374. The 
statute of Texas in the teeth of the 
prohibitions referred to assumes to for- 
bid Negroes to take part in a primary 
election the importance of which we

have indicated discriminating against them by the 
distinction of color alone. States may do a good 
deal of classifying that it is difficult to believe 
rational, but there are limits, and it is too clear 
for extended argument that color cannot be made 
the basis of a statutory classification affecting the 
right set up in this case. 
Judgment reversed.” 
This epoch making decision emphasizes again that 
while the N. A. A. C. P. primarily directs its 
efforts towards combatting oppressive conditions 
affecting Negroes, its work at the same time is for 
all minority groups and both directly and indirectly 
is serving the vast interest of all American citizens. 
For example, if legislation designed for residential 
segregation of Negroes or if private property i:olders’ 
agreements limiting the right of purchase and occu- 
pancy by Negroes should have the stamp of Court 
approval put upon them it would be only a matter 
of time before the same kind of legislation and 
agreements would be used against Jews, Catholics, 
persons of foreign birth and other minority groups. 
So in the White Primary Case the decision gained 
by the N. A. A. C. P. in ending this form of dis- 
franchisement affects directly the questions of Con- 
gressional control of primaries and of whether or 
not public offices in America shall go only to those 
who either have great wealth or for whom offices 
can be purchased by persons of wealth. It is im- 
possible to estimate hqw far reaching the effects of 
this decision will be. ye BP 


THE NEW ORLEANS SEGREGATION 
CASE 

N the day following the handing down of the 

above decision there was argued in the United 
States Supreme Court another case carried there 
by the N. A. A. C. P. It will be remembered 
that in 1917 in the famous case of Buchanan v. 
Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 77, the United States Su- 
preme Court ruled that city ordinances or State 
laws designed to segregate Negroes were unconsti- 
tutional. Within the last two years several cities, 
apparently unaware of the Louisville Case and its 
decision thereon, passed segregation ordinances, 
among them being Indianapolis, Indiana; Norfolk, 
Virginia; and New Orleans, Louisiana. It is felt 
that one of two things was hoped for by the pro- 
ponents of these ordinances in these places—either 
that Negroes would submit without protest to this 
illegal legislation or that the United States Supreme 
Court might reverse itself on the Louisville Case 
decision. 

Both of these hopes were proved to be ill founded. 
In Indianapolis, colored citizens aided by a few 
fair minded white people raised approximately five 
thousand dollars within ten days, retained the ablest 
counsel obtainable and defeated the Indianapolis 
ordinance in the lower courts. 

In Norfolk, through the splendid work of the 
Norfolk Branch of the N. A. A. C. P. and its 
president, Attorney David H. Edwards, the local 
ordinance was defeated easily. 


N New Orleans, however, the situation was more 
difficult. The framers of the ordinance there 
imagined that they had found a way to evade the 
ruling of the Supreme Court. The Louisville ordi- 
nance expressly forbade a Negro occupying a house 
in a so-called white block. In New Orleans the 
ordinance stipulated that a Negro was forbidden to 
occupy a house in a white block or a white person

ae to me your heart all bleed- 


When ad I been known to mock men’s

To scoff at men because their hearts 
were full, 

Despise them in their grief? 

I am the Comforter. 

I make the lilies. 

I am the merciful. 

Hope in me. 

Bring unto me the wounds that throb, 

The sorrows of which you would not

The Town 


LIVED with my aunt in a small 
town. There were lots of colored 
people there. It was a nice town with 
trees in it and at the end of our street a 
river and a little house where a colored 
man sold whisky and sometimes beer 
,o My aunt liked our town. She 
said she always lived there. My uncle 
liked our town, too . He washed 
his overalls in the backyard on Sundays 
There were two churches in. our 

town. 


The School 


There were colored children in the 
town school. All the little colored chil- 
dren were in one room and the teacher 
was colored, too. I don’t think she liked 
the school When I was in the 
third grade I went into another room 
with the white children and the teacher 
was white, too. I don’t think she liked 
the school either. She said we were all 
bad children Sometimes they 
slapped me in the school. 


The Difference 


You’re a nigger. You ain’t as good 
as I am ‘cause you're a nigger 
Paul said that to me but he didn’t mean 
to hurt me when he said it. He was my 
friend. We played games together all 
the time and we went to the woods on 
Saturdays to look for May. apples and 
birds . . . He said you ain’t as good 
as Iam. You're a nigger, but he didn’t 
mean to hurt me I asked my 
aunt what I should say when Paul said 
you're a nigger. I liked Paul so I asked 
my aunt what I should say.

Red blood and white and black combine— 
Can you dissever yours from mine? 
Such motifs are not thus undone, 

Like prowess might command the sun.

*Tis now too hard and passing late 
To disentwine the threads of Fate!

Josephine Baker 
— BAKER, the slim 


autumn-brown girl who has been 
the premiere artiste of Paris now for 
over a year was born in St. Louis, Mis- 
souri, not much over nineteen years 
ago. Now she is the star of the Folies 
Bergere and hailed as the greatest at- 
traction Paris has known since Mis- 
tinguett. 

To Wilsie Caldwell, an original 
“Shuffle Along” girl, goes the credit 
of “discovering” Josephine. Together 
they played in local colored shows in 
St. Louis until finally Josephine had 
the opportunity of joining the “Shuf- 
file Along” company number two. 
When this company disbanded, she 
worked with the number one group 
until the show finally closed. . Her 
eccentric and abandoned dancing and 
her ludicrous facial contortions gained 
her her first recognition when she was 
playing as the “girl on the end” in 
“Chocolate Dandies”. 

Josephine discovered Broadway and 
Paris via hard work, Daly’s Sixty- 
third Street theater and the Charles- 
ton. She was working at the Planta- 
tion cabaret on Broadway with Ethel 
Waters when her company went to 

. Paris to fill an engagement at the

Champs Elysees Music Hall. Paris 
was soon charmed with her joyous per- 
sonality, her dusky beauty and the 
wild grace of her dancing. Following 
immediately upon the close of “La 
Revue Negre” at the Champs Elysees 
came Josephine’s one year contract 
with the management of the Folies 
Bergere. Her name was placarded all 
over Paris. The leading scenic artists 
designed her settings. No money was 
spared to make her a success. And

she was. Paris clamored for her and 
Paris is still clamoring for her. 

Josephine is truly a Cinderella child. 
The poverty and struggle of her first 
few years have been changed into 
riches and success by the wands of am- 
bition and work. Her gowns are de- 
signed by Paul Poiret, the celebrated 
dressmaker and art connoisseur; she 
owns a beautiful Voisin limousine and 
occupies a palatial apartment in the 
Champs Elysees designed by Poiret 
and others. Her hats, her shoes, her 
delicate perfumes, her fans, almost 
everything she owns, are the products 
of the greatest artists of Paris. And 
the money still comes rolling in. She 
has made a new contract with the 
Folies Bergere and she now has a con- 
tract with a night club, where all she 
has to do is to put in her appearance 
after theater hours. Josephine Baker 
is nearing the top of the ladder of 
Success. 

And the beauty of it all is that this 
slender brown girl, who has become 
the most talked of person in Paris, 
has retained the simplicity of youth 
which is the secret of her charm.

Calendar Chat 


AY is Veery’s time. Shy bird! He 
hides so much that were it not 
for his song we might forget there is a 
Veery. 
“Up the airy mountain, 
Down the leafy glen 
We daren’t go a-fishing 
For fear of little men.” 


Veery is just as mysterious but not 
so mischievous as these “‘little men” of 
the glens who stole the lovely child 
away, though Veery also loves glens. 
He likes the deep shadowy woods with 
its ravines of white pebbles and purple 
runs and velvet mosses. 

You and I like the woods pretty 
well in the daytime when we can find 
red Solomon’s seal berries. But not at 
night when trees are so strange and 
shadowy and leaves rustle warningly. 
I don’t know how Veery can sing out 
there at night. But he does sing. His 
song doesn’t sound uneasy but is gentle, 
clear and sweet. It says “Veer-ie, veer- 
ie’. And again, “Veer-ie” over and 
over. 

Do you remember how he looks, 
shy Veery? He is about the length of 
Bluebird and wears a neat brown cut- 
away, a white collar and a brown spot- 
ted vest. 

He is above all a voice. I believe 
that Veery is more anxious for you to 
hear his song than look upon his simple 
dress. 

A more pretentious bird in appear- 
ance that also hides a great deal, dodg- 
ing about on the earth, seldom mount- 
ing to trees because of his funny little 
wings is Towhee in splendid black coat, 
red sweater and white vest. He has 

‘not the sweet voice of Veery. His 
notes are harsh. Yet, when in May 
you start hunting for the owner of 
Veery’s voice, you will hear as well the 
notes of Ground Robin or Towhee or 
Chewink, all the same bird. 

Oh, Veery’s come back with the May- 
time. 

I'm happy to hear his sweet song. 

And Veery will stay here till autumn. 

I hope summer’l! be so long! 

That I may just listen to Veery 

At twilight half hidden away. 

If all summer through 

He whistles to you, 

You wish that the summer would stay.

Stripo 

HOOTING along the old rail 

fence he-went, sliding with blind- 
ing speed and then down into the name- 
less mass of small weeds and vines at 
the foot of the stake-and-rider fence. 
He was gone, Stripo the little acorn- 
colored chipmunk with the dark and 
light streaking dewn his back. 

I had watched a chipmunk disappear 
along this same fence one bright windy 
March day and lose himself in dry 
brush and bleached foliage. But this 
May day Stripo had been singing as 
only chipmunks can. He had been 
leading a chipmunk chorus in which 
all the others from chipmunks along 
the fences to those back in the thin 
bright grove had joined. It is strange 
how these little animals sing. They 
are happy and brisk of movement. 

In cold weather they lie snugly 
sleeping under the earth in burrows 
that they have stored with nuts carried 
there in their cheeks in the fall. Stripo

they murder baby birds!

HE Vanguard Press is publishing 

a series of most excellent little 
books, including ‘““Fhe New Tactics in 
Social Conflicts” by Laidler and 
Thomas, for the League for Industrial 
Democracy and “Negro Labor in the 
United States” by C. H. Wesley. They 
are also republishing “Economic Clas- 
sics” by Ruskin, Tolstoi, Lenin and 
Wells, radical fiction and educational 
outlines. The books sell for only fifty 
cents each and should be in the hands 
of all who dare think. 

We shall review Wesley’s excellent 
study later and also “Black April” by 
Julia Peterkin, the author of “Green 
Thursday”, published by the Bobbs- 
Merrill Company. 

Andre Siegfried’s “Les E’tats-Unis 
D’Aujourd’hui (anglice “America 
Comes of Age’, Harcourt, Brace and 
Company) forms in its English edition 
a book of 358 pages, of which the first 
chapter on “Origins of American Peo- 
ple”; the 6th, on the “Color Problem” ; 
the 7th, on ‘Race Consciousness and 
Eugenics”; the 19th on the “Ku Klux 
Klan” and the 25th on “America and 
the Yellow Races’ will be of special 
interest to our readers. Chapter 6 is 
not accurate in detail but on the whole 
it gets the spirit of the Negro prob- 
lem. He says: 

“The South is unable to shake off 
this shirt of Nessus and it pays a ter- 
rible price for its régime of violence and 
hatred. Materially the disastrous ef- 
fects of the Civil War are over and 
forgotten with the return of prosperity, 
but intellectually and morally how 
barren! Everything is poisoned, even 
religion ess 

“In the great cities of the North the 
Negroes are no longer the ‘good nig- 
gers’ of legend, for they are neither 
humble nor deferential. In the eco- 
nomic struggle they have not fared so 
badly. In the factories they get good 
wages, they have their own newspapers, 
banks and theaters and among their 
élite are to be found lawyers, doctors, 
writers and artists—a living proof of 
the fact that the race is able to rise.” 

His final word is: 

“An unprejudiced observer is forced 
to a painful conclusion. In the old 
days the whites may have been able to 
keen ten million men of another race 
under their yoke, but it is now very 
dificult and will probably be impos- 
sible in the future. What then are the 
avenues of escape? A return to Africa? 
The idea cannot be seriously enter-

tained. ‘The destruction of the Race? 
Equally impossible. Fusion? This is 
occurring to a certain extent, but one 
hardly dares suggest it as a solution.” 
Unfortunately M. Siegfried and his 


sro’! 


publishers spell it “negro”! 
IN THE MAGAZINES 
THE CHARACTER of the numer- 


ous African problem articles is evidence 
of the growing knowledge that at bot- 
tom, the race problem is in truth an eco- 
nomic problem. The Right Honorable 
Lord Olivier exposes ““The Five Fears 
of South Africa” in The Contemporary 
Review for February. The fear of the 
increasing competition of natives with 
Europeans in the wage-labor market ; 
the fear of the rapid increase in num- 
bers of the natives; the fear that the 
white man may adopt Kaffir habits; 
the fear of inter-racial unions and mis- 
cegenation; and the fear that the rap- 
idly increasing numbers of natives will 
force equal rights. All this is con- 
science balm to the European in South 
Africa in attempting to legislate the 
natives back into virtual slavery. 

The Italian-German struggle for 
colonial possessions in Africa is dis- 
cussed by Evans Lewin in Foreign Af- 
fairs for April under the title of “Ger- 
man and Italian Interests in Africa’. 
Germany is demanding African pos- 
sessions to produce raw materials and 
foodstuffs needed by the industrial 
population and to provide markets for 
her manufactured goods; and to free 
herself from the stigma of incompe- 
tency. Italy demands that Germany 
shall not be given a colonial grant be- 
fore Italy receives the imperial loot 
promised her openly by the Treaty of 
London and inferentially by the Trea- 
ty of Versailles. 

The recent agreement between the 


. South African Government and a dele- 


gation of Indians described in The 
New Statesman for March 5, under 
the title of “Indians in South Africa” 
does not approach the heart of the In- 
dian problem, but it arrests for the 
time being the need for drastic legis- 
lation. A vague agreement, which is 
capable of self-interpretation by In- 
dians as well as by South Africans, 
declares that Indians canable of main- 
taining western civilization standards 


should be allowed to do so. 

After ten years of continuous con- 
troversy, the United States has taken 
“A Forward Step” in granting to the 
Virgin Islands, nine-tenths of whose 
population is Negro, full rights of citi- 
zenship, says The Nation for March 
30. 

Relative to the recent Supreme 
Court decision, making void the bar- 
ring of Negroes from Texas Demo- 
cratic primaries, The Literary Digest 
for March 19 discusses “The Negro’s 
Right to be a Democrat” by means of 
a series of newspaper clippings from 
various parts of the country. 

In the same magazine, March 26, 
the Supreme Court decision that “No 
Laws May Part White and Black” 
is interpreted as invalidating all segre- 
gation laws passed in recent years. 

Jim Tully tells of “Famous Negroes 
of the Ring” in J’anity Fair for April. 
A brief history of pugilism from the 
battles of the Gladiators before the 
birth of Christ down to the present 
time and the histories of Negro fight- 
ers from Bill Richmond, who was 
born in 1763, through Jack Johnson 
and Tiger Flowers, make an entertain- 
ing half hour’s reading. 

If anybody is as gullible as Lyle 
Saxon shows himself in the New Re- 
public for March 23, he can discover 
in New Orleans or New York as much 
“voodooism” and bootleg whiskey as 
his pocket can pay for. 

In the monthly Review of Nations 
published at Geneva by Felix Valyi 
much space is devoted to race prob- 
lems in articles published both in 
French and English. In the March 
number, Herbert Miller has an excel- 
lent article on “Changing Conceptions 
of Race”. : 

The American Mercury for April 
publishes James Weldon Johnson’s 
beautiful poem, “Go down, Death’, 
another of his paraphrases of Negro 
sermons. We quote one stanza of the 


. dying of Sister Caroline in Yamacraw : 


“And Death took her up like a baby, 
And she lay in his icy arms, 

But she didn’t feel no chill. 

And Death began to ride again— 

lp bevond the evening star, 

Out beyond the morning star, 

Into the glittering light of glory, 
On to the great white throne. 

And there he laid Sister Caroline 

On the loving breast of Jesus.”

THE Crisis 








— es ee Ul 





For almost three years and immedi- 
ately after my father’s death, I have 
been desperately fighting against great 

odds to retain my 
Mound Bayou father’s estate, which 

is the town of Mound 
Bayou, founded and left by him for 
the Negroes of this state and the U. S. 
But the law of the white man in deal- 
ing with the Negro is the law of in- 
timidation. The real truth is, that we 
are afraid to make a complaint, al- 
though we are ground to dust. .. . 


We have been intimidated by being 
put in a common jail, there to remain 
all night with lice, filth and the in- 
sults of common white men; released 
without any charges against us, locked 
up without a warrant. Every man or 
woman who tries to help me is like- 
wise dealt with, white or colored; and 
soon are silent and remain away from 
ie... osaia 
1 have had some of the best lawyers 
in this part of the state without any 
results, for soon an impossible condi- 
tion is created by the designing and 
they give up the case, always advising 
me to sign mortgages, suit claim 
deed, or anything in the thieves’ favor. 
For almost two years I have filed with 
the court petitions for the removal of 
the Administrator but they were taken 
from the files and never reached the 
court. Now the situation has become 
desperate. : 


Our home, 8 years old, built at a 
cost of $35,000 is being advertised for 
sale for $5,000. Although free of all 
incumberances when father died, a 
mysterious note rose up and. was 
placed on the home. This is the home 
only “fit for white men” to live in, 
and must be taken away from us... . 

——— has sold the Negroes of this 
state back into slavery, he has used 
every ounce of his energy to deliver 
the landowners back into peonage, by 
deceiving them into the trap set to get 
their farms into the hands of the white 
man. I also find that even some of our 
newspaper men with the largest cir- 
culation are afraid to expose this 
Judas who is undoing the work of my 
father, and of his forty years of hard 
labor.

THE OUTER POCKET 


2 


rr, 





About two years ago, Rev. I. H. 
Kelley, pastor of a local Baptist 
Church (Colored), accused even by his 
own members of be- 
ing under the influ- 
ence to a marked de- 
gree of white persons, made an un- 
successful attempt to organize here a 
society to be dominated by whites. 
About two months ago Williams, of 
Ft. Worth, Tex., formerly secretary 
of a Baptist Church there with the 
moral support and the assistance of lo- 
cal solicitors interested a number of 
persons in the organization which Kel- 
ley failed to succeed with and which 
is known to the public as “The Star 
of Columbia.” 

“The Star of Columbia” is repre- 
sented as not being antagonistic to the 
N. A. A. C. P. but as an interracial 
organization of Southern People ‘“‘with 
whom we must live, while the N. A. 
A. C. P. is dominated by Northern 
white people”. ‘The Star of Colum- 
bia” attempts to settle race differences 
through understandings, sympathetic 
bonds, etc., and from this point, if 
there is failure, or need of strife, the 
N. A. A. C. P. operates. From the 
outside “The Star of Columbia”’ is or- 
ganized (it appears) on similar lines 
to the K. K. K.; it is a secret, oath 
bound organization with degrees ; based 
on the Bible. The graphic representa- 
tion is an arch; one side composed of 
a black membership, the other a 
white; the top represents the highest 
degree as where the two races meet; 
the rank and file of the membership 
are not allowed to know what in- 
dividuals compose the white member- 
ship. Solicitors and other representa- 
tives are paid; some salaries, some 
commissions; judging from the num- 
ber who claim they have been offered 
good salaries for their services and the 
activities of those who are working, 
there is plenty of money for propa- 
ganda; though many express them- 
selves as suspicious of the organization. 

Sutton Griggs, of Tennessee, lec- 
tured here last month and not long 
ago, I am told, at Houston and Ft. 
Worth in the interest of the Star and 
will lecture here again this week. 


of San Antonio, Texas. 


Black KK K 





I enclose several clippings of the 
Port au Prince dailies about a case of 
rape by an officer of the Constabulary, 





Lieutenant O’Don- 
nell, of the Marine 
Corps, on a girl of 


Helpless Haiti 


eleven years. 

The semi-official paper, /’Essor, has 
published all the facts about the case, 
September 13, and also, the nationalist 
organ, the Courrier Haitien. 

The American Occupation is trying 
to hide the facts and to whitewash 
Lieutenant O’Donnell. 

The editor of the semi-official pa- 
per was forced by the American au- 
thorities to give a sort of denial in- 
tended to whitewash the guilty officer 
and the Chief of Constabulary, Gen- 
eral Turrill, promoted O’Donnell in 
sending him as District Commander 
in the town of Petit Goave. 

Mr. Luc Dorsinville, who is the edi- 
tor of l’Essor, has just been dismissed 
as head of the Passport Service in the 
Department of Interior as .a punish- 
ment for divulging the felonious as- 
sault of O’Donnell on the poor child. 

I have, personally, made an inquiry 
about the case and reliable persons 
have assured me that all the facts pub- 
lished in the Port au Prince dailies 
are perfectly true. 


There have been numerous cases of 
rapes by marines, particularly, in the 
inland, but the families, either by 
shame or fear of reprisals, have always 
avoided making complaint or publish- 
ing the facts in the papers. 

The tropical sun, the Haitian rum, 
the Occupation’s big stick, the Amer- 
ican dollar, make of the men of the 
Marine Corps the most undesirable 
kind of people in the unfortunate land 
of Haiti. 
of Port au Prince.

I like immensely the new form in

This is a real step forward and I con-

Song for a Dark Girl 
By LANGSTON HUGHES 
From “Fine Clothes to the Jew’, Knopf. 


AY Down South in Dixie 
(Break the heart of me) 
They hung my black young lover 
To a cross roads tree. 


Way Down South in Dixie 
(Bruised body high in air) 
I asked the white Lord Jesus 
What was the use of prayer. 


Way Down South in Dixie 
(Break the heart of me) 
Love is a naked shadow 

On a gnarled and naked tree. 


A BIT OF CONTRAST 


A WASHINGTON colored woman, 
A COOK, 60 years old, found 
HER INNER clothing afire, and 
BECAUSE of her modesty, refused 
TO TEAR off or permit the 
CLOTHING to be torn off to 
EXTINGUISH the fire, policemen 
AND FIREMEN having to disrobe 
HER BY force to keep her from 
BURNING TO death; and, in 
CONTRAST TO her conduct, we 
RECALL THE white girl who 
STRIPPED OFF everything and 
TOOK A bath in a tub filled 
WITH WINE, for the delectation 
OF WHITE men and women in 
NEW YORK under the direction of 
EARL CARROLL, who is not likely 
TO EVER forget the affair. 

The Washington, D. C., Times. 


PORTLAND STANDS FAST 


Portland’s public schools are demo- 
cratic and for that reason the adminis- 
tration today expressed regret over the 
action of the management of the Imperial 
rink, No. 387 East Madison Street, in 
excluding a member of the eighth grade 
of Fernwood school from a graduation 
skating party Thursday night because of 
a ruling against colored races. 

C. A. Rice, superintendent of schools, 
expressed approval of the members of 
the class for abandoning the party when 
George Edward Cannady, 13-year-old 
son of Mr. and Mrs. E. D. Cannady, 
editors of the Advocate and well known 
workers for the welfare of the colored 
people, was refused admittance to the 
rink. 

“The teacher and principal did not 
know the rink had a ruling against col- 
ored people, or the party would never 
have gone there,” Rice said. “If the party 
was held in the school gymnasium or au- 


94 


ditorium, the boy certainly would be in- 
cluded and the class did right to leave.” 

George Cannady is captain of the bas- 
ketball team, class treasurer and was a 
member of the committee which selected 
the class pin and also a member of the 
committee which arranged the enter’ 
ment.

ET TU TEXAS! 


Race “fanaticism”, which } Ow 
sweeping the country”, soon v wd fiave 
entered the legislature but for the deci- 
sion of the United States Supreme Court 
recently holding the Texas statute bar- 
ring Negroes from primaries is uncon- 
stitutional, former Governor James E. 
Ferguson said today. 

The former governor advised the Ne- 
groes to “begin at once to make them- 
selves worthy of this sacred voting 
right”. 

Ferguson declared it is “ridiculous to 
think of how strong the crowd, formerly 
led by ex-Governor Neff and now led 
by Governor Moody, were for the en- 
forcement of the eighteenth amendment 
ahd how strong they are for the viola- 
tion of the fifteenth amendment by the 
passage of a law that will take away the 
right guaranteed under the constitution”. 

He asserted that if a law can be passed 
to exclude the Negro voter, “it won’t be 
but a short time until they will pass a 
law excluding the Bohemian race and 
then it will be easy enough to pass a law 
excluding the Mexican race. And then 
to cap the climax, a lot of people who 
are still mad about the war will rise 
up and demand that the law be passed 
excluding the German race from the pri- 
mary elections, and then, in truth and in 
fact, the constitution will become a scrap 
of paper. Every good citizen should re- 
joice in the fact that the Supreme Court 
has stepped in and promptly declared for 
the perpetuation of the God-given right 
of suffrage”’.

attempting to gain a fvothold. 

Come out Friday Evening and hear 


what is in store for you, unless imme-

SACKCLOTH 

Mr. DuBois is quite right in his con- 
clusions about the white race. It hasn't 
played the game quite right. One has 
only to read the history of human 
slavery, once defended as a divine insti- 
tution, to understand that. At the time 
of the World War we preached glibly 
the doctrine of human equality knowing 
all the while that we were not quite sin- 
cere. We knew then that all men even 
though they may have been created 
equal are NOT equal in temperament, 
riches, training, breeding, culture, intel- 
ligence, imagination, color. We know 
that while we preach that all men are 
brothers we don’t all play golf together 
or sip tea on the front piazza. We know 
that racial lines exist as they have always 
existed, that caste separates men more 
widely than the lines of distance and that 
a snobbish attitude toward life and living 
still is potent to sway the hearts of men.

WELCOME, WEST INDIANS! 


The greatest.patriotic demonstration it 
has been my privilege to witness was that 
staged in this city on the first of this 
month when Captain Waldo Evans, U. 
S. N., retired, took the oath of office as 
Governor of the Virgin Islands and 
announced to the thousands gathered 
around that President Coolidge on the 
28th of February had signed the bill 
making the people of the Virgin Islands 
citizens of the United States. 

The inauguration took place in one 
of the historic parks of St. Thomas, 
known as “Emancipation Park”. It was 
in this park that the emancipation procla- 


- mation was read so many years ago and 


historians claim that the rejoicing and 
emotion of the people on this occasion 
far exceeded that of the slaves that were 
made free. It was at once made mani- 
fest to the Governor that the people of 
the Virgin Islands are a fine type of citi- 
zen, loyal to the United States and ap- 
preciative of every consideration given 
them by the mother country... . The 
granting of citizenship will add about 
26,000 new citizens to the population of 
the United States.

THE NEW AFRICAN INSTI- 
TUTE 


The governing body of this new In- 
stitute, which will be a clearing house 
for information on so many important 
aspects of the life of the people of Africa, 
will be international. It will number 
about 40 representatives from scientific 
societies from various countries in Eu- 
rope, America, Egypt and South Africa. 
It will also include missions of all sects, 
who have exceptional opportunities for 
studying the languages, beliefs, customs 
and traditions of Africa. The British 
and French Governments have expressed 
cordial approval. 

The object in view is to promote inter- 
national co-operation in the task which 
Western civilization has undertaken in 
its dealings with primitive African peo- 
ples, to form a bureau c° information 
where the work already done by different 
countries can be made available for edu- 
cational and other purposes. Its head- 
quarters will be in London. The Insti- 
tute will abstain from any interference 
whatever in matters of policy and ad- 
ministration and will be a link between 
scientific knowledge and practical work 
in Africa. The first task is to lay down 
principles for a practical orthography for 
African languages and to apply them to 
particular cases after full consultation 
with all those who have knowledge. 
Meanwhile it will collect its publications 
in African languages and also books in 
European languages dealing with African 
beliefs, tribal laws, languages, customs 
and music. Finally, it will publish a 
quarterly journal. 

The services of Professor Delafosse, of 
Paris, and of Professor Westermann, of 
Berlin, both of whom had acquired an 
international reputation in these subjects, 
were secured as directors of the Insti- 
tute, by whom, under the supervision of 
an Executive Council, the work will be 
carried out. We have suffered an irre- 
parable loss by the recent death of M. 
Delafosse, who has been succeeded by M. 
Labouret.

PREMPEH CONQUERS 


A historic event took place last Wed- 
nesday when the Kumase train slowly 
rolled into the Accra Station. It brought 
to Accra no less a personage than Nana 
Prempeh recently restored to the Head 
Chieftaincy of the Kumase tribes of 
Ashanti. The event is historic in that 
this is the first time that King of Ashanti 
has ever set foot within the confines of 
the Accra District. The primary pur- 
pose of the visit is to witness the open- 
ing of Achimota College. No doubt he 
will also make this an opportunity of 
making the acquaintance of the Ga Man- 
chemei. He is putting up during the visit 
at Bannerman’s Buildings in Christians- 
borg. We wish him a warm welcome to 
Accra. 

Hours before the arrival of the train, 
the Station Road and its approaches were 
packed full of people eager to get a 
glimpse of him and in this there was 


May, 1927 


much conjecture as to which end of the 
Station Road he would take to reach 
Christiansborg. The train came in at 
last and there was a rush by those who 
had got access to the Station Yard which 
the police did their best to stem. After 
the ceremony of greeting those who had 
come to meet him among whom was the 
Hon. T. Hutton-Mills who, by the way, 
has blood connection with the Ashanti 
Stool, Nana Prempeh was driven away 
in a car along Governor Rowe Road to 
Christiansborg. A loud cheer was raised 
by the crowd as he passed which he gra- 
ciously acknowledged. Single handed 
Nana Prempeh has accomplished what a 
predecessor of his, just a hundred years 
ago was unable to do with his legions of 
fighting men viz:—the cenquest of Accra. 
The story of his exile of over 27 years 
duration and his eventual restoration to 
the stool of his ancestors has served to 
gain him a warm place in the hearts of 
the people.

THE GREAT MULATTO 


For many years Dumas earned a very 
large income—and was always in debt. 
Yet he was without any personal ex- 
travagance. He was the most frugal 
eater and he neither smoked, drank nor 
gambled. He simply gave away money 
in handfuls and generally to the unde- 
serving. ‘My biographer,” he once said, 
“will not fail to point out that I was a 
basket with holes in it, neglecting as a 
matter of course to mention that as a 
rule it was not I who made the holes.” 

He was a very simple, human man, 
who, being a tremendous success, was 
naturally and properly exceedingly vain. 
When Queen Victoria and the Prince 
Consort went to Paris in 1855, the com- 
pany of the Comédie Frangaise gave, at 
the Queen’s request, a special perform- 
ance of Dumas’s play “Les Demoiselles 
de’ Saint Cyr”. A friend said to the 
dramatist: “You ought to be very proud 
since this is the second time that the Brit- 
ish Sovereign has seen your play.” “It 
is,” was the reply, “like its author, the 
better one knows it, the better one loves 
it. I know, however, what would have 
amused her more than to have seen my 
piece, that would have been to have seen 
me and frankly I should have been 
amused too.” “Then why do you not ask 
for an audience?” “I had thought of 
it,’ said Dumas; “the remarkable wo- 
man who will probably be regarded as 
the greatest woman of the century really 
ought to meet the greatest man in 
France.” 


Sidney Dark, in 
John O’London’s Weekly. 


A BLACK STATESMAN 


Captain C. T. Knox, in the “Morning 
Post”, pays a distinguished tribute to the 
late Sir Apolo Kagwa, the African Prime 
Minister of Uganda. I extract the fol- 
lowing: 

I was once asked by a lady whether it 
was not very dangerous living so much 
amongst cannibals. People visualize 


Uganda as a large country consisting of 
a great deal of sand, thickly peopled by 
black men who wear fig leaves and a 
ferocious expression. I was disbelieved 
when I remarked mildly that there was 
very little sand in Uganda and that the 
Natives wear considerably more clothes 
than the young woman of today. Let 
people with such ideas imagine a vain 
thing. But to those people who know, 
the passing of Apolo Kagwa will mean a 
good deal. It is a link with the past 
rudely broken. It is the loss of a great 
leader of men. It will conjure up memo- 
ries of a far seeing, loyal and most en- 
lightened gentleman. To be Prime Min- 
ister of a progressive country like Ugan- 
da is no light task and to rule over an 
enlightened Native Parliament calls for 
qualities and brains of no mean order. 
Apolo Kagwa paved the way for the oc- 
cupation by the British and braved every 
danger and terror to compass his object. 
He realized that through the British and 
only through them, could his unhappy 
and terrorized country drag itself out 
of the mire. Then the British came and 
Apolo Kagwa was content. He saw his 
country grow to prosperity and content 
under the wise counsel of the British. 
He saw created a Native Parliament 
with the King as its head and with him- 
self as its Prime Minister. He framed 
rules and procedure which enabled his 
countrymen to take a hand at governing 
themselves and which enabled them to 
dispense law and justice to their own 
people in their own Parliament with their 
awn Cabinet. The Native Parliament, or 
Lukike, of Uganda, is one of the most 
marvellous institutions in the world.

MISSISSIPPI APPLAUDS! 


Goodman, Miss.—The people of Good- 
man, with one accord, acclaim Dan 
James, a Negro man, about 50 years old, 
his nephew, Tom Smart, and Tom Lee 
Weir, real heroes. 

Five Negroes, Moses and Ada Graves 
and their three children, were caught in 
the flood waters of Big Black River last 
night and had a narrow escape. Trying 
to cross the swollen stream, which had 
overflowed the pike across the bottom to 
a depth of three to five feet, their team 
and wagon were washed off the dump 
into water about 15 feet deep. The cur- 
rent was swift and they managed to catch 
the limbs of trees and hold their heads 
above water. 

Troy McDaniel, who lives at Camden, 
attempted to drive across just behind the 
team and had to abandon his car when 
half way acros~ the pike and wade and 
swim to safety. He brought the story 
of the plight of the Negroes and sought 
aid for them. 

The rescue is a story of thrilling in- 
terest which is rarely found in the his- 
tory of a community and records an act 
of real courage. 

A boat was hastily made and parties 
set out to the rescue. Before going 50 
yards the boat filled with water and 
sunk. Night had come on. A safe boat

HE three colored State Normal 

Schools are: The Winston-Salem 
Teachers College with a 2-year Nor- 
mal course and a 4-year College 
course; the Fayetteville State Normal 
School with a 2-year Normal course; 
the Elizabeth City State Normal 
School with a 2-year Normal course. 
Normal courses in Agriculture are 
also offered at the A. and T. Col- 
lege, Greensboro, and courses for the 
training of high school teachers at 
the North Carolina College for Ne- 
groes at Durham. Recent appropria- 
tions have been made in the legisla- 
tion past which will raise the Durham 
school to a Grade A college. This is 
in fulfillment of the demand of the Su- 
perintendent of Public Instruction for 
1923-24: 

“At present there is no State insti- 
tution whose graduation merits a 
teacher’s certificate in Class A. This 
condition, in my opinion, should be 
speedily remedied. There should be 
a place where the normal school gradu- 
ates could go for further training. 
‘They must continue to study if they 
are ever to place the instruction of the 
Negro on an increasingly higher plane. 
This institution should - make ample 
provision for these graduates and train 
them for the supervision of instruction 
in the grades and for the best teaching 
positions. 

“Again, this college should admit 
high school graduates and offer them 
a four-year course leading to a high 
school teacher’s certificate in Class A.

very rapidly. The educational system 
for the white people was built from 
the top down. I am suggesting that 
we build for the Negroes from the bot- 
tom up. If it is to be a unified system, 
there must be a college to train high 
school teachers and elementary super- 
visors in order that the high school 
may be first, fed and second, properly 
supplied with instructors. If we do 
not have good high schools there will 
be indifferent normal school students 
and poor instruction in the elementary 
schools. A school system is a unit. Un- 
less all parts of it are properly de- 
veloped, all other parts will eventually 
suffer.” 

North Carolina has 26 private 
schools. Of these 24 are church 
schools; 13 supported by white 
churches and the remainder by Negro 
churches. There are in these schools 
2,594 high school students and 491 col- 
lege students. These with the Nor- 
mal Schools and the proposed A col- 
lege represent the facilities for teacher 
training and higher education.

cold; a biting wind was blowing from

gathered at the water’s edge. The Ne-

Finally Dan James stepped from the 
crowd and proposed to go to the rescue. 
Immediately he was joined by Tommy 
Smart, his nephew, and Tom Lee Weir. 
Rev. W. M. Huddle, pastor of the Lu-

for their success and safe return. After 
two hours of suspense Dan and his com-

of our determination to build the best 
instruments possible, together with con- 
stant investigation and research work 
which we are continually sponsoring. 
These have led to many improvements 
and refinements, so that to-day ‘Uni- 
versals’ are the unquestioned leaders in 
everything desirable in Therapeutic 
Lamps. 

“Believing the more progressive of 
the profession would appreciate better 
lamps, we have not only kept in con- 
stant touch with the clinical application 
and usages which have shown such re- 
markable results that they have already 
taken first rank as disease combatants, 
put have supplemented our nineteen 
years of experience by constantly draw- 
ing on all standard works of Physics 
and General Therapeutics and have 
freely consulted world famous Scien- 
tists, Electrical Engineers, Heads of 
and Professors in Departments of Phy- 
sics in such Institutions as the Uni- 
versity of Chicago, Armour Institute, 
United States Bureau of Standards, 
University of Illinois, research de- 
partments of the General and Westing- 
house Electric Companies. 

“Personal consultations, supplement- 
ed by reference to the works of such 
medical authorities as Finsen, Rollier, 
Babbitt, Kellogg, White, Eberhardt, 
Neiswanger, Grubbe, McMichael, 
Clark, McCaskey, Joslin, Donnelly, 
Snow, Plank and many others have 
been of inestimable value in shaping 
the basic principles on which ‘Uni- 
versal’ Lamps are constructed. 

“Thus the development of ‘Uni- 
versal’ Therapeutic Lamps has been 
more than the mere adhering to beaten 
paths and the assembling of stock elec- 
trical materials and mechanical de- 
vices. They embrace features and 
workmanship, adjustability, range, sim- 
plicity and an ease of operation unap- 
proached by any other make, placing 
them in quite a different and superior 
class. 

“The field of indications of Light 
Therapy is so large, the results so sat- 
isfactory and so easily obtained that 
its use is ideal for the General Prac- 
titioner as well as the Specialist.” 


LL THIS does not mean that Mr. 

Johnson is out of the woods by any 
means. In the first place, some phy- 
sicians are peeved just because a col- 
ored man is making these things. Once 
in a while he gets a letter on the sub- 
ject from the South. Also he is still in 
the shadow of the General Electric 
Company. He is working on com- 
paratively small capital. If he were a 
white man, the process, while in a 
sense unfair, would have its compensa- 
tions: he would be taken into the Gen-

eral Electric Company's organization 
and made a Manager or an Investi- 
gator at a large salary. But this can- 
not happen to Mr. Johnson. He is 
colored. Therefore, he is fighting 
alone and he is making a splendid and 
so far successful fight. 

Mr. Johnson writes of the develop- 
ments of the present year: 

“There have been two important de- 
velopments since you visited us. One 
is the introduction of the Lamp illus- 
trated and described in the enclosed 
circular. We are pleased to report that 
this Lamp has been well received by 
the profession and during the last four 
months of 1926 our business was so 
large that we found it necessary to 
work each night as well as the usual 
day period. That condition continued 
throughout the holidays and continues 
now. 

“Another is, we have acquired an 
Italian engineer who has perfected pro- 
cesses that will enable us to break the 
strangle hold on this industry now held 
by the General Electric Company. We 
do not want any mention of. details 
made of this latter development, at 
least not at this time.” 

Finally he ends with brave and de- 
fiant note: 

“Kipling said it when he wrote the 
following lines: 

“They asked me how I did it, 

And I gave ’em the Scripture text, 
‘Just keep your light so shinin’’ 

A little in front of the next. 


“They copied all they could follow, 
But they couldn’t copy my mind, 
And I left them sweatin’ and stealin’ 


A year and a half behind.” 


Mistaken Identity 
(Continued from page 81) 


My co-traveler ran to the drummer 
and exclaimed in dire distress, “Oh 
me! I’m plum upsot. I thought I was 
in company with a white woman an’ 
I’ve rid an et an been in company with 
a nigger all day,” and went out. 

I never saw my “beloved” companion 
any more. I spent the remainder of 
my wait in the wholesome company of 
the Attorney and today I am the happy 
wife of that most courteous Editor.

began to remodel the property intend- 
ing to make it a two-family house, 
half of which he was to occupy and 
the other part he intended to rent. 
Joseph Tyler, a white man, sought un- 
der the ordinance to restrain Harmon 
from carrying out his purposes. 

The New Orleans Branch of the N. 
A. A. C. P., under the leadership of 
Dr. G. W. Lucas, obtained attorneys 
and raised approximately twelve thou- 
sand dollars to see the case through 
to its conclusion. The case was won 
for Mr. Harmon in the lower courts 
but on appeal to the Louisiana State Su- 
preme Court the decision was reversed. 
The case then went to the United 
States Supreme Court where it was 
argued on March 8, 1927. Loys A. 
Charbonnet and F. B. Smith of New 
Orleans represented Mr. Harmon and 
the N. A. A. C. P., basing their case 
w nee upon the decision in Buchanan 

. Warley. Francis P. Burns, Assist- 
ant City Attorney of New Orleans and 
Walter Wright, attorney for Tyler, 
argued for the ordinance. 


ESSRS. Burns and Wright were 

asked by members of the Su- 
preme Court how the New Orleans 
ordinance could be constitutional in 
view of the Louisville decision. Among 
the arguments advanced by Messrs. 
Burns and Wright was the naive one 
that since conditions had changed in 
the ten years since the Louisville de- 
cision was rendered the Supreme Court 
ought to go back thirty-one years to its 
decision in Plessy v. Ferguson. This 
answer caused amusement to several 
members of the Supreme Court. 

On Monday, March 14, 1927, at 
the regular meeting of the Board of 
Directors of the N. A. A. C. P., the 
story was being told of the argument 
in this case when Mr. J. E. Spingarn 
dramatically brought the news he had 
just read in an afternoon paper that 
the Supreme Court had rendered its 
decision that very day throwing out 
the New Orleans ordinance on the ba- 
sis of Buchanan v. Warley. 

It is felt that this decisive defeat of 
the ordinance will forestall any fur- 
ther attempts along this line in other 
cities. Thus the N. A. A. C. P. has 
struck two powerful blows at funda- 
mental evils in American life, 
that not only will affect Negroes 
and their constitutional rights but 
which will be of immeasurable benefit 
to all of America.

ing that the meeting -just closed had 
reached so high a peak of enthusiasm 
and genuine worth no succeeding meet- 
ing could surpass it. And each fol- 
lowing year the conference went be- 
yond the one before it. It is apparent 
that this same experience must come at 
the Indianapolis Conference which be- 
gins on Wednesdey, June 22nd, and ex- 
tends through the meeting at which the 
Spingarn Medal. is to be awarded on 
Tuesday, June 28th. 

One reason. for such optimism is the 
fact that since the Chicago Conference 
in 1926 the Association has gained a 
greater number cf notable victories 
than in any preceding year. There are 
the United States Supreme Court de- 
cisions in the Texas ““White Primary” 
and New Orleans Segregation Cases, 
the further reduction of the sentences 
of the members of the 24th Infantry 
yet remaining at Leavenworth, the ex- 
pose of the lynching of the three Low- 
mans last October at Aiken, South 
Carolina, and the world-wide publicity 
attendant upon that case and many in- 
dividual cases° where injustice was 
checked. All these victories have es- 
tablished the name of the N. A. A. 
C. P. for efficient achievement more 
firmly than ever before and they give 
added importance to its deliberations. 

Each annual conference of the As- 
sociation held has been notable, too, in 
the calibre of the speakers who have ad- 
dressed it. At Indianapolis this high 
record will not only be maintained but 
from present indications there will ap- 
pear on the program an even larger 
number of distinguished men and wo- 
men. Two great legal figures, Louis 
Marshall and Clarence Darrow, have 
accepted invitations to speak. Countee 
Cullen, the poet; Bishop William T. 
Vernon of the A. M. E. Church; Dr. 
W. E. B. DuBois; Dr. Will W. Alex- 
ander of the Interracial Commission ; 
Governor Ed Jackson of Indiana; 
Arthur B. Spingarn, Chairman of the 
National Legal Committee of the 
N. A. A. C. P. have likewise agreed to 
speak; while a number of others have 
accepted tentatively whose names will 
be announced later when they have 
definitely accepted. 

Indianapolis is centrally located and 
many visitors will attend the Confer- 
ence in addition to those who attend 
as delegates. A very cordial invitation 
is extended to all persons, whether 
members of the N. A. A. C. P. or not, 
to meet with us at Indianapolis. As 
the attendance is expected to be very 
large and as we are anxious that all 
who attend may be comfortably and 
conveniently housed it is urged upon 
all who plan to attend that they notify 
the N. A. A. C. P. as soon as possible.

Mr. George S. Schuyler tells in 
The Nation of March 23 of his extra- 
ordinary sense of humor which leads 
him to enjoy race discrimination. 

In The Nation, March 16, Rayford 
Logan writes most interestingly on 
the “Haze in Haiti’: 

“Conclusive evidence of this policy 
of encroachment and blundering ap- 
pears in the history of the Medical 
School. Under Haitian supervision pro- 
fessors got $30 a month. The build- 
ing became so dilapidated that profes- 
sors and students had to use umbrellas 
while in class. Unable to resist the 
temptation of a much higher budget, 
the Haitians finally permitted this 
school to be supervised by an Ameri- 
can sanitary engineer. Immediately 
$60,000 appeared for a new building, 
an increase from $80 to $250 for the 
Haitian director and a corresponding 
increase for the professors. All of this 
in order to graduate doctors who will 
not be permitted to hold clinics in the 
Americanized Haitian General Hospi- 
tal. In the meanwhile the Law 
School, which is still under Haitian 
administration, remains in its old 
building, the professors continue to 
struggle along on their $30 a month 
and enjoy their moot court without 
American interference.”

that appeared some months ago in the

Negro cast. The play, which aroused 
much comment and played to larger 
audiences than any other in the history 
of the society, was a marked success. 
Preceding the play, a short recital by 
William A. Rhodes, who rendered a 
program of his own compositions and 
a series of dances interpretive of the 
poems of Langston Hughes, was 
ziven. The characters in the play it- 
self were portrayed by Alice Burg- 
hardt Crawford, Ralph M. Coleman, 
James E. Downs and Kenneth Tell. 

@ Under the auspices of the Dunbar 
Forum, two tragedies, “Silas Brown”’ 
and “Peter Stith”, both by S. Randolph 
Edmonds, were presented recently by 
a group of students of Oberlin Col- 
lege. “Peter Stith” received honorable 
mention in THE Crisis contest of 
1926. 

@ A “Greenwich Village Party” was 
ziven in Chicago recently by the “Fly- 
ing Squadron” of the N. A. A. C. P. 
The program consisted of a play, writ- 
ten by Carriebel Cole Plummer; a 
musical ensemble by the club members ; 
and interpretive dancing. Mrs. Geral- 
dine Glover is president of the club and 
Miss Audry Davis, secretary. 

@ The Theater Guild has announced 
that a dramatization of DuBose Hey- 
ward’s novel “Porgy” will be its first 
New York production next season. 

@ Krigwa, New York, announces 
April 20, 25 and 27 as its second sea- 
son for 1927. The players will pre- 
sent “Blue Blood” by Georgia Doug- 
las Johnson, “Fool’s Errand” by 
Eulalie Spence and a repetition of two 
plays given during the first season, 
1927: “Compromise” and “Her”. 

@ The Dixwell Players of New 
Haven, Connecticut, recently presented 
three one-act plays of Negro Life: 
“The Chip Woman’s Fortune”, by 
Willis Richardson and “The Rider of 
Dreams” and “Simon the Cyrenian”, 
both by Ridgely Torrence.

WEST AFRICA 


@ Nigeria, one of the British West 
African colonies, is more than seven 
times the size of England and is the 
most populous of all of the British de- 
pendencies outside of India. It con- 
tains peoples at every stage of develop- 
ment, from naked cannibals to highly 
organized Yorubas. and_ civilized 
Hausas and Fulas. 

@ There are today in Yorubaland, 
nine cities with more than 40,000 in- 
habitants. The people are not only 
farmers, but work in metal work, 
building and weaving. 

@ Between 1919 and 1927, the Gold 
Coast has built a new harbor, 233 
miles of railway, 3388 miles of motor 
roads, 1910 miles of telegraph lines 
and 1570 miles of trunk telephone 
lines. 


@ The City Council of Free Town, 
Sierra Leone, has been abolished and 
a town Municipal Board put in its 
place. 

@ E. O. Asufu Adjaye, who has re- 
cently been admitted to the bar in Eng- 
land, is now located on the Gold Coast. 


Mr. Adjaye, who is 23 years old, stud- ~ 


ied at University College and the In- 
ner Temple, receiving the degrees of 
B. A. and LL. B. and also winning 
several prizes for excellence in studies. 
He is the first Ashanti to become a 
member of the English bar. 

@ The revenue for trade during 1926 
is the highest on the Gold Coast rec- 
ord. Exports of cocoa exceeded 230,- 
000 tons and that of manganese, 360,- 
000 tons. 


@ The Gold Coast Certificate of 
Honor was awarded by King George 
recently to eighteen residents of the 
Gold Coast, in recognition of their 
services to African civilization. 

@ Achimota College was opened re- 
cently ik 60 pupils: 33 boys and 27 
girls for the kindergarten department. 
The college will accommodate 800 
students when it is completed.

The Diplomatic Service 


HE treatment which the United 

States is meting out to the colored 
men in the diplomatic and consular 
service is beneath contempt. Hunt 
and Yerby, with long and honorable 
records in the consular service, rated 
by every test as consuls of unusual 
ability, have been practically demoted 
and turned aside instead of being given 
their rightful chance to rise. Hunt 
has been sent from one of the most 
important manufacturing districts of 
central France to the little Island of 
Guadeloupe. Carter, who has already 
served twenty years in the tropics, has 
been asked to take his wife and young 
child to West Africa. Finally he has 
been allowed to go to Calais, France. 
The State Department is using every 
device to get rid of some of its best ser- 
vants, simply because they are men of 
Negro descent. 


Le Zoute 


E have refrained from comment- 

ing heretofore upon the confer- 
ence concerning Africa which took 
place in Le Zoute, Belgium, last sum- 
mer. There were present a great many 
well-meaning friends of black folk and 
much was done that has our entire ap- 
proval. Back of the whole move- 
ment, however, we seem to see the old 
determination to do things for Afri- 
cans and not to let them work for 
themselves in generous co-operation 
with their white friends. There is 
absolutely nothing in the program of 
Le Zoute which was not included in 
the program of the Pan African Con- 
gresses; and yet not only were these 
Congresses ignored in the assembling 
of this conference, but a determined 
attempt was made to discredit their 
work and to outlaw them by public 
resolutions. This attempt was de- 
feated but it shows the animus of Le 
Zoute. Instead of white missionaries 
and colonial officials being willing to 
let men of African blood take steps 
for their own emancipation, it is pro- 
posed to keep this matter closely in 
the hands of white people and to ask 
for the co-operation only of that kind 
of Negro which. this kind of white man 
can trust. This is a most unfortunate 
state of affairs.

Negro Crime 


HE Census report on prisoners for 

1923 gives us some chance, albeit a 
narrow one, of judging crime among 
American Negroes. It is senseless to 
regard crime as racial or characteristic 
of certain individuals. Crime is one 
of the best indices of social condition. 
When, for instance, we realize that 
American Negroes, having nine and 
three-tenths per cent of the population 
eighteen years of age and over, furnish 
23.3 per cent of the commitments to 
prisons and jails, this teaches us two 
things: first, that Negroes are more 
easily convicted of crime than whites, 
and secondly, that, allowing for this, 
nevertheless our poverty, our search 
for work, our crowded city popula- 
tion and our growing resentment at 
color caste, leads to a large amount 
of law-breaking. Despite this, crime 
among us is decreasing. For every 
100.000 of Negro population in 1910, 
1,822.7 were committed to prisons 
during the year, while in 1923 this 


proportion had fallen to 1,305.9, a de- 
crease of 28.4 per cent. 

The character of crime among us 
gives further light: nearly one-fifth of 
the commitments are for “disorderly 
conduct”, which covers everything 
from fighting to “‘sassing”’ a white man 
or glancing appraisingly at his wife. 
Other delinquencies follow: one-eighth 
of our crimes are for drunkenness; one- 
tenth for stealing; one-thirteenth for 
“‘vagrancy’’. 

While the Negro is responsible for 
nearly one-fourth of all the commit- 
ments he is charged with less than 18 
per cent of the commitments for rape, 
but with 42 per cent of the commit- 
ments for homicide and over half the 
commitments for - carrying’ concealed 
weapons. Of course, the latter repre- 
sents the efforts of whites to disarm 
black men. 

Here is a large job of social uplift, 
of which truly a large part is the fault 
of our neighbors. The rest is the bur- 
den of the dead and of us who live 
and strive. 


By Way of Escondido 


OUTHERN CALIFORNIA was 

afloat. It lay bedraggled beneath 
grey waters. Lovely little bungalows 
dripped slime. Palms wept. Rivers 
roared and plunged and tossed away 
their captive bridges. The mountains 
rained avalanches and streets floated 
beneath crawling cars. And I was 
in Los Angeles, with a lecture in San 
Diego, 132 miles away. The railroad 
hung looped like a ribbon with its giant 
girders cracked, broken and plunged 
into the sea. The roads looked quite 
impassible. Very well. I would go 
by the Pacific Ocean, for I was to lec- 
ture in San Diego. 

Then the boat balked. It was to 
sail at eleven and arrive at seven; it 
suddenly decided for sake of the 
stranded public to leave at two! 
“Very good,” said the Man, “we'll 
drive through!” ‘You can make it,” 
cried the Auto Club, “by way of Es- 
condido”; which being interpreted is 
“The Little City Hidden in the 
Hills!” 

So there was Man and Wife and 
Me and a staunch Chandler. None 
of us really believed we could do it

but it was ours to try for I had a lec- 
ture in San Diego that night. We 
started out and the golden sun started 
with us. Away we whirled through 
the wide crowded city out 9th Street 
to Mines Avenue. It was 11:15 in 
the morning and I was to lecture at 
eight. 

“No, not that way!—this! by La- 
guna Beach and by way of Escondido! 
You may win through!” 

On, 40, 50, 60 miles to San Juan 
Capistrano. Day darkened. The grey 
Pacific lay like lead upon our right, 
and left rose weeping rainswept moun- 
tains. “Which way is best to San 
Diego?” The first of three stone- 
faced men said: “You can’t get 
through!” Well, we knew we couldn’t 
but we wouldn’t admit it even to each 
other. Not much! “Sure we'll make 
it,” we said aloud and stoutly: “By 
way of Escondido!” 

Yonder aloft rose the ancient walls 
of the Mission. Down below lay the 
sullen, lazy water. We plunged and 
ran into the end of a line of cars. We 
peered ahead.. Sun and rain seethed 
above us. The cars beyond us hesi- 
tated; some turned back. Others 
turned aside. We went down to the 
brink of a grey-brown unbridged river 
whirling angrily. We looked at each 
other. “Let’s go!” we said, word- 
lessly. The Ford car ahead of us 
lurched in, toppled perilously, camped 
on a sand bar, swerved left across an 
island; dipped and plunged right and 
was out. Ours was a heavier car, but 
we followed. A hundred spectators 
grinned at us in cheerfu! anticipation. 
We dipped and turned, fell and ‘rose, 
swayed and churned, paused and were 
out on dry land, cutting and running 
for Escondido. The engine sighed and 
stopped. Our hearts did the same. 
We examined the carburetor and 
coaxed it dry. On again we flew. 

Aloft up in the hills, with a brown 
big mountain at one end of Main 
Street, lay Escondido. We turned to- 
ward it at Oceanside after missing the 
way. We were 90 miles from Los 
Angeles and again a stonefaced man 
said: “You can’t get through!” 

We believed him, but we said to 
each other: “Of course we can!” and 
on we ran forty more miles to Escon- 
dido up hill and down dale past the 
old Mission of San Luis Rey with its 
brown and withered walls; by orange 
groves with globules of sun-light, by 
lemons and avocados. While all about 
the ghostly mountains rode high in the 
ghostly sky. 

Into Escondido, out and then forty 
miles this side San Diego and one 
hundred fifty from Los. Angeles by 
our winding way, we saw a sign: 
“Ferry to San Diego closed until 6 
A. M.!” 


106 


A stone-faced man much more posi- 
tive than all the others said: ‘You 
can’t get through, unless you fly!” 
Yes, some had gone through earlier in 
the day by help of horses but now 
neither horses nor help were left; only 
waters and quicksands. We _ were 
dumb. Then we started up. “We'll 
phone to San Diego for help and ride 
to our side of the river and they to 
theirs and then, if need be, we will fly 
that river for I lecture in San Diego 
this night!” 

“T’ll stay and sleep in the car,” said 
the Wife waveringly; “Have you got 
an extra pair of shoes?” asked the 
Man. On we tore 18 miles to where 
the river, a black sea of churned mud, 
made a steep bank, a staked ford and 
a porous sponge of meadows for a far 
landing place. But, lo! two stout 
horses spelled hope! In we plunged, 
dropping ten good feet and then stuck; 
glory be! the big horses and the engine 
groaning in low pulled us slowly out. 

“There is another bridge washed out 
two miles on,” said the driver, cheer- 
fully pocketing the bills. We laughed 
back as cheerfully as possible and again 
flew south. The Man smoked furi- 
ously, pipe and cigar—Ah! That was 
a brave tobacco bill! I toyed with a 
dozen quite tasteless cigarettes. The 
Wife ate red apples. Here at last 
was the third hole in the ground and 
no horses! A frail foot bridge re- 
mained and the Wife and I walked 
across ; baggage and Man dropped into 
the flood and floated. “Safe at last,” 
I said. “I lecture tonight in San 
Diego.” Then we looked for the 
meeting friends. Not there! We 
searched for our car and, the Saints 
preserve us, but with the help of a big 
truck that backed back in, it had won 
through. We clambered gaily in and 
on we rolled to San Diego.—10 last 
miles and 10 of the longest, darkest, 
hardest miles; and then the silver and 
gold of the city streamed below and 
Charles with the other car swung in 
sight. 

I lectured at 8:30 in San Diego on 
“The Future of Africa” to them that 
sat very still and looked and listened ; 
and with baptismal music of the Sor- 
row Songs from Piney woods. 

And next day, Ah! The jewelled 
Pacific, the lordly snow mountains, the 
green hills and valleys and the silver 
walnuts carpeted with mustard gold! 
The callas and roses and palms; the 
lemons and the tall Eucalyptus, brown- 
green in the sun! Ho! the jolly 
friends and the good food and the dear 
lady who will write poetry and the 
long roll home under pale yellow aca- 
cias “by way of Escondido!” 

And the moral is: If you must talk 
in the Holy City of St. James, secure, 
first of all, intercession of Our Lady 


* battle of blood or blows. 





of the Angels, with her Man called 
of God whose name was John; and 
of his trusty car, Excalibur; and 
then, by Faith and Grit you can do it 
—“By way of Escondido!” 


Victories 


HERE is probably not a single or- 

ganization for social uplift in the 
United States that can point to such 
an astonishing and important series of 
victories before the highest court of 
the land as the N. A. A. C. P. When 
we began work seventeen years ago 
there was one gate posted “No Hope 
Beyond” and that was the Supreme 
Court of the United States. Before 
that tribunal the 13th Amendment 
had been barely enforced; the 14th, 
emasculated and the 15th ignored; the 
Civil Rights Bill had been killed; the 
“Grandfather Clause” evaded and 
“Jim Crow” legislation had not re- 
ceived a single setback. 

Nevertheless, the N. A. A. C. P. 
arrayed itself for battle and has today 
the following record of victories be- 
fore this court: 

1915, June 21st, the “Grandfather 
Clause”. 

In the case of Guinn and Beale vs. 
the United States, the court held that 
the “Grandfather Clauses” were mere 
evasions and affirmed the right of the 
Negro to vote under the 15th Amend- 
ment. 

1917, November 5, in the case of 
Buchanan vs. Warley, the court de- 
clared unanimously that a residential 
segregation ordinance is in direct vio- 
lation of the 14th Amendment. 

1923, February 19, in the case of 
Moore, Hicks, Knox et al vs. Dempsey 
the court declared that due process of 
law involved a fair trial unintimidated 
by the threat of mob violence. 

1927, March 7, in the case of Nixon 
vs. Herndon the court declared that 
the exclusion of Negroes as such from 
a political primary was unconstitu- 
tional. 

1927, March 14, in the case of Har- 
mon vs. J'yler the court declared that 
the New Orleans segregation ordi- 
nance is unconstitutional. 

There could be no more heartening 
set of victories. It means that the bat- 
tle of the color line need never be a 
It can be a 
battle of laws and justice. 

But such battles take money and it 
is astonishing, not that this Associa- 
tion was given $44,344 to spend last 
year, but that 12,000,000 people of 
even rudimentary intelligence should 
contribute such a pittance. Until the 
day comes when American Negroes 
can spend freely $500,000 a year in 
their defense, they will never be fully 
free.
