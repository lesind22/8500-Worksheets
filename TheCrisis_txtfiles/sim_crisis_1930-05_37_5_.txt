has through the liberal patronage 
of old policyholders and the in- 
suring public abundant evidence

Future Home Office ; °

—. 3-in-1 disability contracts. 





The amount of life insurance written since January |, 1930, 
under the Whole Life, Twenty Payment Life and Twenty Year 
Endowment Policies has been far in excess of the expectations of 
the officers of this company, and they likewise have been gratified 
at the persistency of the business written and the care which the 
field staff has exercised in selecting risks; that is, lapses on such 
business have been light and claims negligible. 





























The company is thus rendering at this time a far larger service 
to race people over its territory than at any other period of the 
thirty-eight continuous years of its operation. Claim payments under 
its 3-in-1 disability Policies have been a bulwark to tens of thou- 
sands of race people and homes during the winter period, and despite 
the general depression and lack of employment no policyholder of 
this company has had to look to or accept charity in the hour of 
Sickness, Accident or Death.

Tue Crisis 










ATHER is a peculiar man. To 

be peculiar is not unusual, but 
father’s peculiarity is, perhaps I should 
say was, so very unusual that we all 
hope it will not break out again, be- 
cause, while it was interesting and no 
harm came of it, it was rather wearing 
upon the family while it lasted, and 
it is easy to imagine a different and a 
tragic outcome. Suppose, for instance, 
father hadn’t waked up at all? 

The particular incident I refer to 
transpired more than ten years ago, 
just before and reaching over the end 
of the Great War. 

It was an evening about ten days 
before the armistice was signed, while 
the Mevse-Argonne drive was at its 
height. We were all in the living 
room after supper—father, mother, my 
elder sister Imogen, who is a high 
school teacher; her fiancé, Percival 
Biggs; my younger sister, Helen, who 
was taking a business course in Com- 
mercial High School, and my young 
brother Billy. Father was seated in 
a cushioned armchair by the table, on 
which stood the electric reading lamp. 
He had been reading aloud, from the 
Boston Evening Transcript, which is 
delivered in our town in the late after- 
noon, the latest news of the progress 
of the fighting, and the predictions of 
experts as to the probable duration 
of hostilities. Percival, who was a 
stenographer in a law office, and was 
studying law in a night law college, 
and who was regarded by father as a 
very intelligent young man, had made 
several comments. Imogene, who had 
been doing war relief work on several 
committees, had contributed to the 
discussion. Mother had _ expressed 
what turned out to be the vain hope 
that the end of the war might soon 
bring prices down, when father again 
took the floor. Father loves to talk, 
“ which respect he is not at all pecu- 
iar. 

“For my part,” he said, “the way 
Foch and Pershing have got them 
sewed up, the Huns can’t advance 
much farther. Their supplies are so 
nearly exhausted that they couldn’t do 
much fighting if they did, and their 
morale and their transportation system 
are so shot to pieces that they can’t re- 
treat rapidly, and, if they could, we’d 
follow ’em to Berlin, and then where'd 
they be?” 

He straightened himself up and 
leaned forward with both hands grasp- 
ing the arms of the chair. 


May, 1930 





~Concernin g Father 


A Story 


Mr. Charles W. Chesnutt, dean 
of American novelists of Negro 
descent, has kindly broken his long 


silence for THE Crisis and sent us 
this fascinating short story with its 
characteristic touch of color. 





“In my opinion,” he announced, 
“this war will come to an end on 
the’ — 

He stopped abruptly, and continued 
silent, while we waited for him to fin- 
ish his sentence. Finally, after several 
moments, Percival spoke up. 

“You were saying, sir?” 

There was no response. We waited, 
breathlessly at first, then with a vague 
feeling of uneasiness, but still there 
was no answering sound. We saw 
that father’s eyes were closed, and the 
natural assumption was that he had 
fallen asleep. But somehow this as- 
sumption was not convincing. His 
posture was not consistent with slum- 
ber. Had he fallen asleep he would 
have slumped back into the comfort- 
able depths of the chair. 

“For heaven’s sake!” exclaimed 
mother, “it isn’t at all like your pa 
to go to sleep that way, all of a sud- 
den. Sam,” she said, coming closer 
to him, “wake up, and go on upstairs 
if you’re sleepy. We'll excuse you.” 

She reached over, took him by the 
shoulder, and tried to shake him. 

“Well, I declare,” she exclaimed, 
“he’s as stiff as a board. I can’t move 
him alone. Maybe Percival ’Il help 
me get him upstairs.” 

Percival came over and took him by 
one arm and mother by the other, but 
they were not able to budge him. 

“Maybe he’s dead,” said Billy trem- 
ulously. “Teddy Wickham’s grandpa 
had a stroke last week and dropped 
dead out in the garden while he was 
pulling carrots.” 

“No,” said I,—I had attended some 
Red Cross first aid classes, and had 
read more or less about death and its 
attendant incidents,—‘‘if he were dead, 
rigor mortis wouldn’t set in for sev- 
eral hours, and, as mother says, he is 
stiff already.” 

“Hadn’t we better call a doctor?” 
suggested Percival. 

Mother had seated herself a short 
distance away, and was apparently 
deep in thought. 

“No, children,” she said, after a 


night. 






By CHARLES W .CHESNUTT 


moment, ‘“‘we won’t call a doctor, and 
we needn't be alarmed. Your pa 
slept a whole day and two nights once 
before, when Emma Jane was a baby. 
I couldn’t wake him up, and we sent 
for the doctor, and he said it was all 
right, at least for a day or two. And 
on the morning of the second day your 
pa woke up just as usual and went 
on about his business. And when I 
told him how scared I’d been, he told 
me never to bother about anything he 
did, that he had a peculiar streak in 
him that might crop out now and then, 
but it always came out right in the 
end, and that I wasn’t to say anything 
about it, because he was a_ business 
man, and any reputation for being pe- 
culiar would hurt his business. So 
we'll just leave him where he is—I’ll 
throw a blanket over him—and maybe 
he’ll wake up in the morning, and if 
he doesn’t within a day or two, we'll 
consider the matter further. So I guess 
we'd better calm ourselves and go to 
bed and get our night’s rest. Don’t 
say a word about this outside of the 
house, because I know that’s what 
your pa would wish.” 

So we separated for the evening. 
Imogene, who was to be married as 
soon as Percival was admitted to the 
bar and began to practice, went out 
into the hall with him to bid him good 
Mother brought a double 
blanket and tucked it around father, 
turned out the lights, and we all went 
upstairs to bed. 

Only mother and Billy slept well, 
and Imogene and I were the first ones 
up next morning. We woke mother 
and Billy, and then went somewhat 
fearfully downstairs to light the 
kitchen stove and get the breakfast 
started. We had given up our maid 
because of the war, and were doing 
our own housework, except the laun- 
dry work. On the way to the kitchen 
we peeped into the living room. 
Father was just as we had left him 
the night before. He had not moved 
a line, so far as we could perceive, and 
the blanket was still tucked around 
him as mother had arranged it. 

We had the breakfast started when 
mother came down, and then, before 
sitting down at the table, we all went 
into the living room. 

I took my courage in my hands and 
applied some of the theoretical knowl- 
edge I had acquired in my Red Cross 
course. I sent Billy upstairs to my 
bedroom for a hand mirror and held it 


153 


before father’s lips. There was a 
faint moisture upon the surface of the 
glass, very faint, but enough to prove 
that he was still breathing, however 
lightly. I felt his pulse. It was very 
feeble, almost imperceptible, but 
enough to show that his heart was 
still beating. His flesh wasn’t exactly 
warm, but it wasn’t cold. I had a 
clinical thermometer, which I man- 
aged to get into his mouth through the 
vacant space from which a loose tooth 
had been recently extracted, which he 
had meant to get replaced with a false 
one when he got around to it. His 
temperature was away below normal, 
but he still had a temperature. 

When I had announced these reas- 
suring conclusions, mother said: 

“Well, now, children, your father’s 
alive, and he'll come out of this trance, 
or whatever it is, when he gets good 
and ready, and we needn’t worry about 
it, as long as he doesn’t change from 
what he is now. In the meantime, 
keep your mouths shut. I know it’ll 
be easy for you girls, but I’m not so 
sure about Willie. If anybody asks 
about your pa, tell ’em he went away 
on a business trip. So he did, a week 
ago, but you needn’t tell "em he came 
back today. Now, Willie, if you 
breathe a word about your pa’s being 
home or about his condition, you'll 
have to deal with me, and with him 
later. But if you keep perfectly quiet, 
when your pa comes around I'll see 
that you get that new bicycle you’ve 
been pestering him about.” 

So we went in to breakfast. Per- 
cival called before we had scattered 
to our various daily pursuits, and we 
told him that father’s condition re- 
mained the same, and that he was to 
say nothing about it, but to come 
around that evening as usual. 

Percival came after supper. He had 
gone to the Public Library after leav- 
ing the office, and had been reading up 
on cataleptic trances, suspended con- 
sciousness and other abnormal physical 
conditions. He expected, he said, that 
his cousin, a distinguished nerve spe- 
cialist who had been in France for a 
year in the army service, would return 
to his home in Boston on leave within 
a week, and whether father had recov- 
ered or not by that time, that he would 
write him a letter, stating a hypotheti- 
cal case corresponding to father’s, and 
ask him for an opinion. 

A week or more passed without any 
apparent change in father’s condition. 
Of course so well known a man as he 
couldn’t disappear without evoking 
some curiosity among his friends and 
business associates, but we managed to 
stave off any discovery or suspicion. 
We received callers in the library and 
kept the door between it and the liv- 
ing room locked. We arranged a screen 


154 


to prevent any one from looking in the 
living room windows from the out- 
side and seeing father, and put the 
shades down at night. We indeed got 
so accustomed to the situation that we 
resumed our evening gatherings in the 
living room, and even got accustomed 
to father’s silence, which we had never 
had an opportunity to do before, be- 
cause father had rarely been silent 
when there was anything being said. 
I sometimes wondered, somewhat un- 
filially, I suspect, if nature were not 
taking this means of evening up things 
by giving him a long rest from speech. 
It might have seemed to an outsider a 
little uncanny, but we became accus- 
tomed to the situation, and mother, 
who was of course the person most 
concerned, did not seem to worry. 

“We'll wait a while yet,” she would 
say, “and give him a chance. He’s no 
worse than he was, and he'll come 
around all right. He told me not to 
worry if he did anything out of the 
common, and I’m not worrying. It 
won’t last much longer, because he’s 
got to be at the office on the fifteenth 
to attend the annual meeting. ‘The 
office called up today and asked where 
he was. I said he’d been called away 
on private business— as he certainly 
was—so that was no lie. They asked 
would I give them his address so that 
they could telephone or write him. I 
said no, he didn’t want anybody to 
know where he was, but I said he’d 
be back in time for the meeting, and 
if they wanted to write they could ad- 
dress the letter to the house and I’d 
forward it.” 

Two weeks had passed without any 
apparent change in father’s condition, 
and we were all becoming a little ner- 
vous and apprehensive. Even mother’s 
Olympian calm was beginning to 
crack, and she had about decided to 
call the doctor, when our troubles 
came to an end without any interven- 
tion on our part. 

On the thirteenth day of November, 
1918, we were all gathered in the liv- 
ing room—mother, Percival, Imogene, 
Helen, Billy and I, the same company 
that were present when father became 
unconscious. Father, still rigid and 
immovable, was leaning forward in 
his chair as usual. For two days the 
town had been a constant din of loud 
and strident noises. Cannon had been 
shot off, church bells rung, factory 
whistles sounded. On the night be- 
fore, the signing of the armistice had 
been celebrated by a procession which 
had passed by our house with a clamor 
sufficient to have awakened the dead, 
so to speak, but none of these noises 
had disturbed father. Percival, who 
had developed quite a flow of speech 
during father’s silence and had taken 
the lead in our evening discussions, was 


reading the details of the armistice 
from the Transcript, when a slight 
noise sounded from father’s direction 
as though he were clearing his throat 
Suddenly he spoke, in a somewhat dry 
and husky voice: 

—“On the eleventh day of Novem. 
ber, at eleven o’clock in the morning!” 

We were all too surprised to scream, 
and sat in a dead silence. Father 
stretched himself a moment and then 
went on. z 

“Good gracious, Susie” —which was 
the familiar form of my mother’s given 
name, “I feel mighty stiff in the joints. 
I guess I’ll go to bed. I never was 
so sleepy in my life.” 

He tried to rise, but mother and Per- 
cival caught him as he tottered. 

“I guess it’s a touch of rheumatism,” 
he said. “You let Lizzie take your 
place, ma, and help me upstairs, while 
you make me a good stiff toddy and 
bring it up.” 

I am named Elizabeth, after the 
Virgin Queen, as was one of my 
grandmothers before me, but I have 
never been able to train father and 
mother to use anything but the vulgar 
old diminutive in addressing me, which 
was sufficiently annoying before it was 
adapted as the pseudonym of a cheap 
tin motor car, after which it became 
utterly unspeakable. The persistence 
of elderly people in clinging to old and 
reprehensible habits of speech and so- 
cial conduct is one of the trials of the 
younger generation from which there 
seems no way of escape. 


We got father to bed, and asked. 


Percival to come to breakfast the next 
morning at seven-thirty. It was a 
holiday and Imogene and the younger 
children would not have to go to 
school, nor Percival to the office, so 
we would have plenty of time to talk 
things over. Then we all went to bed, 
and slept, I imagine, not much more 
than we did the first night we had left 
father sitting alone in the parlor. 

It had been agreed between us the 
night before to say nothing to father 
about his strange experience until we 
met at the breakfast table. In the 
surprise and confusion of the evening 
before we had not quite grasped the 
significance of what father had said, 
or drawn any implications from it, at 
least I had not; but in the still watches 
of the night it was borne in upon me 
that, connecting up the two ends of 
his broken sentence, and eliminating 
the period of lapsed consciousness 
which had intervened, he had predict- 
ed two weeks in advance the exact 
date and hour when the armistice was 
signed and the fighting ceased. How- 
ever, I did not try to solve the riddle, 
but tried to go to sleep, which I 
eventually succeeded in doing. 

We were all seated at table when

father came down. He greeted us 
cheerfully, and we responded in kind. 
He then, after his usual custom, picked 
up the morning paper. . 

“Well, by Godfrey!” he exclaimed, 
“that’s a funny mistake for the Bugle 
to make. This paper is dated Novem- 
ber fourteenth, when it should be Oc- 
tober thirty-first. And what's all this’, 
he went on, as he ran his eye along 
the headlines. “ “Germans retiring be- 
yond the Rhine. More details of 
terms of armistice. People of allied 
nations wild with joy at end of war.’ 
What in the world does this mean? 
All these things couldn’t have hap- 
pened over night!” 

Then mother explained, with occa- 
sional assistance from others of us, 
that they were the events of a fort- 
night, during which he had been un- 
conscious. 

“We didn’t call the doctor,” said 
mother, “because you’ll remember you 
told me, once before, not to worry if 
anything peculiar happened to you. 
And nobody outside of the family, ex- 
cept Percival, knows anything at all 
about it.” 

“We haven’t been able,” said Per- 
cival, “in the absence of expert opinion, 
to determine just what your condition 
was, or what was the cause of it; but 
we thought, in view of what you had 
said to Mrs. Beckett, that you might 
be able to enlighten us.” 

“Well,” replied father slowly, as he 
ate his cereal—father could do almost 
anything and talk at the same time, he 
even talked in his normal sleep—‘‘may- 
be what I’m going to tell you will ex- 
plain it and maybe it won’t; you can 
take it for what it’s worth. It begins 
with a bit of family history about the 
middle of the eighteenth century. I’ve 
never told any of you about it, not 
even you, ma, for reasons which will 
be apparent as I go along. 

“My ancestors, the Becketts, whose 
name we have inherited in the direct 
male line, were seafaring people. This 
town was the principal seaport for the 
Chinese and Indian trade. My great- 
great-grandfather, Jonadab Beckett, 
was not a vessel owner, but was cap- 
tain of a ship that traded in the eastern 
Waters, in silks and tea and ivory, ex- 
changing for them American trade 
goods which suited the Eastern mar- 
ket. On his return from one of his 
voyages he brought home with him an 
Indian wife. 

“Gee!” exclaimed Billy, “like Po- 
cahontas.” 

: “Be quiet, Willie,” said mother, 
and don’t interrupt your pa.” 
., No, Billy,” continued father, 

Pocahontas was an American Indian, 
and my great-great-grandmother was 


an East Indian, a Hindoo, I guess 
you'd call her,” 


May, 1930 


“Of what caste was she?” asked 
Imogene. 

“T don’t know,” said father. “I 
don’t even know what her Indian 
name was. They had been married 
on board another ship in Calcutta har- 
bor, by the captain, according to mari- 
time law, but when great-great-grand- 
father Jonadab brought her home, he 
was persuaded, in order to keep peace 
in the family, to have her baptized 
with a Christian name, and the min- 
ister of their church remarried them 
so as to cure any possible informality 
of the maritime rite. I gather that 
while they didn’t exactly like the mar- 
riage, they wanted to make sure, for 
the sake of possible children as well as 
on moral grounds, that it was an iron- 
bound, copper-riveted marriage. So 
they took no chances. You'll find her 
name in the old Beckett family Bible, 
at your Uncle Joe’s, in Plymouth; I 
think it was ‘Grace Abounding’—I 
don’t remember her Indian name, al- 
though I have heard it. 

“T doubt if she ever knew the mean- 
ing of her Christian name, and her 
new religion, I imagine, was never 
more than skin deep. My grand- 
father, Abel Beckett, who told me 
these things when he was a very old 
man, said that at home, in the privacy 
of her own house, she would some- 
times dress in a silk or satin gown 
which her husband had brought with 
her from India, put on a necklace of 
gold coins or green beads— 

“Rupees and jade!” murmured 
Imogene. 

“With silver bracelets,” father went 
on, “and sit motionless for hours star- 
ing into space or gazing at some little 
bronze or ivory image.” 

“She was homesick,” interjected 
mother, “like I was when your father 
brought me here from Portsmouth.” 

“She was undoubtedly,” suggested 
Percival, “a high-caste woman, a 
Brahmin, and of a fair complexion.” 

“Yes,” said Imogene dreamily, “I 
can see her now, reclining in a cush- 
ioned, silk-curtained palanquin, borne 
by two stalwart coolies, going to shop 
in the bazaars or to make a visit upon 
the women of the zenana of some 
friendly family. She had a complex- 
ion of creamy old ivory, with a rose- 
bud mouth and teeth like pearls.” 

“But pa says he don’t know,” in- 
terposed Billy, ‘and she may have 
been a black, low-caste dancing girl, 
like the one in my geography, with 
bracelets on her ankles and a ring in 
her nose.” 

“Now you shut right up, Willie 
Beckett,” said mother, severely, “and 
stop slandering your  great-great- 
great-grandmother!” 

“T never heard what she was,” said 
father, “or how he came to know her. 














I don’t know whether he bought her, 
or kidnapped her, or whether she 
came with him willingly. But he 
must have loved her, or he wouldn’t 
have brought her home, and she must 
have been respectable or he wouldn’t 
have married her.” 

“At any rate, New England didn’t 
agree with her. I understand she 
never learned much of the English 
language. She stood the climate and 
the Yankee ways about three years, 
and then died, one cold, raw spring, 
of pneumonia, leaving one child, my 
great-grandfather, and was given 
Christian _ burial. As I say, she 
couldn’t have been very dark, because 
none of my ancestors or relations ever 
showed any color, except her son, my 
great-grandfather, who had a slightly 
yellowish cast and very black hair and 
eyes. But he married a _ red-headed 
Garford, and all his descendants, so 
far as I know, have been fair-com- 
plexioned with light hair. I’ve never 
said anything about my East Indian 
ancestry, because, while I have no 
prejudice against color myself, and 
consider one man as good as another, 
other things being equal, yet I know 
how most people feel about such mat- 
ters, and it’s just as well not raise the 
question. 

“T never did take a great deal of 
stock in this heredity,” he went on. 
“T believe God makes each man by 
himself. But if there is such a thing 
as a hereditary throwback, it may be 
that I inherited from my great-great- 
grandmother some obscure faculty or 
tendency which has made me go off 
into a trance once or twice in my life.” 

At this point Billy butted into the 
conversation again. It was the only 
way he could get in. 

“T wonder,” he said, “if I inherited 
enough of her blood to learn to be a 
snake charmer, or a conjurer, and 
make a tree grow from a seed while 
you look at it?” 

“Didn’t I tell you to shut up, Wil- 
lie?” said mother. “Don’t let me 
have to tell you again. You've got 
entirely too much to say. You'll need 
all your time the next four or five 
years to learn your lessons in school.” 

“But,” interposed Percival, ‘even 
that doesn’t quite explain how you 
were able to predict to the hour the 
signing of the armistice, unless your 
ancestress’s power to go into a trance 
Was accompanied by the gift of 
prophecy.” 

“Well, now,” said father, “it was 
hardly a prediction, was it? It was 
spoken after the event.” 

“But without any consciousness on 
your part,” I suggested. 

“Perhaps,” resumed Percival, “while 
you were sitting quietly in the living

HERE is a charming and charac- 

teristic picture of the youthful 
Moorfield Storey in the Journal of 
Ralph Waldo Emerson. In July, 
1866, Emerson and Ellery Channing, 
together with four young ladies and 
three boys just graduating from Har- 
vard—Edward Emerson, Tom Ward 
and Moorfield Storey—went camping 
on Monadnock. They struck bad 
weather, with rain and a north wind; 
and the second evening was so cold 
that the boys, who had given most of 
their blankets to the ladies and to the 
elderly gentlemen, spent the night in 
keeping up the camp-fire, while Storey, 
so lately an ornament of the Harvard 
Glee Club, sang, with Edward Emer- 
son for chorus, a multitude of songs to 
the great delectation of the company. 
That boy who worked and sang in the 
dark and cold, so long ago—singing 
not to keep up his courage but simply 
because he had courage and gayety 
enough for the whole company—was 
the same Moorfield Storey whom many 
of us knew until the end; a slender 
upright figure, the handsome face 
clear-cut in the firelight, playful, la- 
borious, serene, invincible. 

He came of sound Boston and 
Newburyport stock. He had an- 
cestors who for five successive gen- 
erations died at sea. But the pas- 
sion for sea-faring had faded out 
of the Storey blood. Moorfield’s 
father was an easy-going Boston law- 
yer, fond of books and of general con- 
versation. The son, who was born in 
1845, went from the Boston Latin 
School to Harvard College in July, 
1862, at one of the darkest hours of 
the Civil War. In 1896, just thirty 
years after his graduation, he made an 
address in Cambridge about the boys 
of his own college generation. After 
discussing the simplicity of their life, 
their wholesome poverty, their close 
friendships, he turned to a point of 
prime significance for one who seeks 
to understand Mr. Storey’s own char- 
acter. The early sixties, he said, were 
a supreme moment in our country’s 
history. “A great movement for in- 
tellectual, religious and political free- 
dom was just culminating. . . . Lin- 
coln, Sumner, Seward and Chase in 
the political arena, Garrison and Phil- 
lips on the platform and in the press, 
Lowell, Whittier and Harriet Beecher 
Stowe from their studies, had stirred 
the consciences of men.” “It is hard”, 
Mr. Storey went on, “to make you 
young men of today realize what those 
years meant to us. .. . Our whole lives

Moorfield Storey As a Man 


By BLISS PERRY 


The Boston Branch of the N. A. 
A.C. P. recently held a memorial 
service in memory of Moorfield 
Storey. Addresses were delivered 
by Butler R. Wilson, who pre- 
sided; the Hon. James M. Morton, 
Jr., Judge of the U. 8S. Circuit 
Court; Manuel Briones and Mar- 


cial P. Lichauco, Filipinos; and 
Professor Bliss Perry of Harvard, 
formerly Editor of the Atlantic 


Monthly. Bishop Lawrence de- 
livered the invocation. We take 
pleasure in printing Professor 


Perry's striking address. 





before and while we were in college 
put us in tune with the great move- 
ments that were going on about us. 
All that to you is history, to be learned 
in your studies, was to us our daily 
life. It was our privilege to hear 
Phillips and Sumner when what they 
uttered was hot with the feeling of the 
day. They used a language which was 
understood without consulting books. 
Lincoln’s immortal speech at Gettys- 
burg, his matchless second inaugural 
address, were spoken to us. For us 
were written the stirring poems of 
Whittier. We were an instrument 
ready for the musician and the musi- 
cians were here.” 


Such was the young man who heard 
the news of Lincoln’s assassination on 
his way from chapel, ‘20 feet from 
the old Massachusetts pump;” who 
stood before Holworthy on the morn- 
ing of Lee’s surrender, when Harvard 
College declared a holiday; who sat 
under the great tent in the Yard and 
heard Lowell’s Commemoration Ode. 
He never got over it. “We knew”, 
he said, “under which banner to en- 
list. . . . To us the world’s questions 
seemed simple.” 


Genius has often been defined as a 
prolongation of adolescence. Cer- 
tainly a portion of Moorfield Storey’s 
genius lay in_ the prolongation 
throughout his life of this adolescent 
instinct for the difference between 
right and wrong. What Rufus 
Choate once called the “great mixed 
cases” of the world often seemed to 
Mr. Storey not mixed cases in the 
least, but a simple issue of right versus 
wrong. 

He was confirmed in this early habit 
of mind by his intimate association 
with Charles Sumner. Exactly how 
Sumner’s attention was first attracted 
to young Storey, no one seems to know. 





intentionally harsh 


But Storey had led his class in his 
Senior year, had been chosen class ora- 
tor, and at the end of what he always 
declared to be an indolent year at the 
then unreformed Harvard Law 
School, the famous Senator from Mas- 


sachusetts asked him to come to Wash- 


ington as his private secretary. 

I am aware that Charles Sumner’s 
fame has become somewhat dimmed, 
even in this his native city. That fig- 
ure of a great-hearted gentleman, lover 
of books and pictures and all noble 
things, as he appears in the diary of 
Longfellow and the Journal of Em- 
erson, is fading out of public memory. 
In Claude Bowers’s Tragic Era, just 
now so widely read, Sumner is simply 
ene of a sombre and acrid group of 
partisan conspirators, endeavoring to 
defeat that wiser policy of Reconstruc- 
tion initiated by Lincoln and contin- 
ued by Johnson. Their own policy, 
toward former 
slaveowners, and recklessly radical in 
conferring the ballot immediately upon 
former slaves, was for a time triumph- 
ant and then went down in ruin. 
Such in brief is the tale as told by Mr. 
Bowers. But Moorfield Storey, whose 
first year in Washington was the year 
of Johnson’s impeachment, and who 
lived in the closest intimacy with 
Sumner and his associates, always in- 
sisted that there was much to be said 
on the other side. In his Life of Sum- 
ner—which Mr. John T. Morse, who 
ought to know, has recently declared 
to be one of the best volumes of the 
“American Statesmen”  series—Mr. 
Storey remarks: “It is easy to point 
out the evils which Negro suffrage 
caused, but far greater evils would 
probably have occurred had Negro 
suffrage been refused.” Whether his 
judgment was biased by his attachment 
to his old chief I am not wise enough 
to pronounce, but all of Mr. Storey’s 
friends will bear me out in saying that 
his loyalty to Charles Sumner’s mem- 
ory was one of the most winning traits 
of his character. I could never get 
him to admit, in private conversation, 
that Sumner was even arrogant. 
When James Ford Rhodes, a dear 
friend of Storey, wrote that Sumner 
was vain, conceited, overbearing and 
wore a constant air of superiority, Mr. 
Storey made this admirable rejoinder: 
“T lived in his house for two yeafs. 
I sat in his library and saw him re 
ceive men of every rank, race and 
color. I was myself young, and at the 
time sensitive to any affectation of

superiority, and I was struck with the 
gracious courtesy 


with which Mr. 
Sumner uniformly received his numer- 
ous visitors. He was no respecter of 
persons, but his manners were natural 
and kind.” 

And yet, to appreciate adequately 
the vital influence of Sumner upon his 
young disciple, we must go beyond the 
mere affectionate loyalty of a secretary 
to his chief. We must realize that at 
this turning point of young Storey’s 
career, he accepted absolutely and for- 
ever Sumner’s doctrine that the main 
‘ssue in all political and social ques- 
tions is the issue right or wrong. Sum- 
ner taught him to repeat the Roman 
maxim: “Where Liberty is, there is 
my party.” I think that Storey had 
naturally a Roman mind rather than 
4 subtilizing Greek mind. He had a 
clear practical intelligence, an ethical 
rather than a religious or mystical tem- 
perament. He had an instinct for 
cardinal points of action, and he made 
his way straight to them, like a Roman 
road. And he learned from the pre- 
cepts and example of Charles Sumner 
that the one inevitable objective, for 
a high-minded American, was to aid 
his fellow citizens in securing and 
maintaining their rights. 

It is not my function to relate with 
any detail the story of our friend’s 
career; but rather to suggest a few of 
those personal qualities that endeared 
him to other men and gave him a 
peculiar place in public life. You will 
remember that those two crucial years 
in Washington were also years of so- 
cial gayety. It was there that he met 
the beatitiful and high-spirited woman 
who became his wife in 1870. Mr. 
Morse savs that they “waltzed into 
each other’s affections.” Storey now 
resigned his secretaryship, came back 
to Boston, was admitted to the bar, 
and began his long and fortunate pro- 
fessional career. He had precisely one 
thousand dollars, and his wife about 
as much more; but that was, after all, 
enough “to fetch the pump”, and 
thereafter the flow of prosperity was 
continuous. Mr. Storey always 
seemed to work easily and tirelessly. 
Even in middle and later life he could 
put in sixteen hours a day for months 
at a stretch, without apparently feel- 
ing it. His good looks, his wit, his 
courtesy, made him a social favorite. 

Yet all this might be said of many 
another Bostonian of his era. The 
qualities that gradually made Moor- 
field Storey a marked man, and ulti- 
mately gave him a unique position in 
the commonwealth, began to emerge 
in his independence of party lines in 
politics. Without a trace of political 
ambition for himself, he was already, 
in the eighteen-seventies, an organizer 
of an independent movement in Mas- 


May, 1930 


sachusetts. During the bitter Blaine- 
Cleveland campaign in 1884, he be- 
came, as everyone knows, a Mug- 
wump. It cost him many personal 
friendships. He used to chuckle in 
his old age over Senator Hoar’s de- 
scription of those Republicans who, 
like Mr. Storey, supported Cleveland 
as “the vilest set of political assassins 
that ever disgraced this or any other 
country.” He liked the Senator, nev- 
ertheless, as we all did. Fifteen years 
Jater, in the Anti-Imperialist campaign 
against the conquest of the Philippine 
Islands, Senator Hoar and Moorfield 
Storey stood side by side. Both men 
were now denounced as “‘political as- 
sassins”. I need not call the complete 
roll of the causes with which Moor- 
field Storey courageously identified 
himself. The spirit with which he 
fought was much the same, whether 
he was President of the Civil Service 
Reform League, of the Anti-Imperial- 
ist League, of the Indian Rights Asso- 
ciation, or President for twenty years 
of that organization in which many 


of you will think that he rendered _ 


the finest service of all, the National 
Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People. 

All of these causes were unpopular, 
in the sense that they did not com- 
mand, or have not yet succeeded in 
commanding, the general interest and 
support of the American people. Con- 
fident as Mr. Storey might be of the 
ultimate triumph of the principle at 
stake, he was usually in the minority 
at any given time. You were never 
surprised to see his name signed to a 
minority report, and sometimes his was 
the only signature. 

There was a phrase used long ago 
by Fanny Burney, in describing an 
English statesman. He was, she 
wrote, “a professed minority man.” 
We New Englanders recognize the 
tvpe. It is useful in any community. 
Intelligence is always in the minority. 
Dean Inge likes to remind us that 
among the great religions of the world, 
Christianity has always been a minor- 
ity religion. His Majesty’s Opposi- 
tion has often done as much for true 
progress as His Majesty’s Govern- 
ment. A motor car needs a brake as 
well as an accelerator. Nevertheless 
the professed minority men have cer- 
tain temptations to which reformers 
seem peculiarly susceptible. They 
are apt to become despondent. Like 
the prophet of old, they lie down un- 
der a juniper tree and inform the 
Lord that they, and they only, are left. 
They are apt to be cranky. Their 
courage often looks like mere balky 
obstinacy. The man who habitually 
“views with alarm” is almost as ob- 
noxious as the man who habitually 
“points with pride”. 





Now from such typical temptations 
of the minority man Moorfield Storey 
was singularly free. He never lost 
heart. He faced every adverse popu- 
lar verdict with a smile. “It is not 
success to be on the winning side,” he 
declared. “It is success to fight 
bravely for a principle even if one does 
not live to see it triumph.” He was 
absolutely _ fearless. He crossed 
swords, when he thought that the oc- 
casion called for it, with Mr. Root 
and Mr. Taft, Mr. Roosevelt .and 
Mr. Wilson. His spear knew no 
brother, when he believed that- his 
cause was just. He spoke with equal 
disrespect, at times, of the Republican 
party and the Democratic party; and 
I suspect, as Sidney Smith said of Jef- 
frey, that he would have spoken dis- 
respectfully of the equator, if he 
thought that the equator was wobbling 
from its true line. Even those of his 
fellow-citizens who could not agree 
with him found Moorfield Storey’s in- 
dependence refreshing. It was like 
a Boston east wind on an August day. 

The secret of his character, as I 
read it, was his love of justice. His 
Roman mind, his legal training, his 
sympathy for the oppressed, were all 
combined to give him power as an ad- 
vocate. Now you cannot love justice 
without hating injustice. I once heard 
a man say that he burned the caterpil- 
lars out of his apple-tree not because 
he hated the caterpillars but because 
he loved the tree. If Mr. Storey’s 
language ever seemed harsh or pitiless, 
it was because he was scorching a few 
caterpillars of the commonwealth in 
order to secure equal rights and op- 
portunities for all men. 

It would be absurd to claim that 
upon all the hundreds of topics which 
his friends have heard him discuss, Mr. 
Storey’s opinions were invariably cor- 
rect. He would have been a dull com- 
panion if they were. His old friend 
Henry Higginson used to say that 
down on State Street if you guessed 
right three times out of five you were 
considered a success; if you guessed 
right only two times out of five you 
were a failure. I am not mathema- 
tician enough to calculate Mr. Storey’s 
precise average, but I should call it 
distinctly better than three times out 
of five. Yet I have often heard him 
talk to a dozen intimate friends for 
a whole hour with learning, eloquence 
and superb dialectic skill, without con- 
vincing anybody. And the paradox is 
that we liked him none the less, and 
perhaps all the better, when he made 
no converts. There are always win- 
ners enough, but here was a good loser. 

What fascinated us in his old age 
was that same gayety of heart which 
he had shown as a boy when he fed the

Pushkin 


By A. V. LUNACHARSKY 


Formerly People’s Commissar for Education in the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic 





This article is translated from 
the Russian by the Paris Monde, 
edited by Henri Barbusse, and then 
into English by Elizabeth Prophet. 


The introductory note in the 
Monde follows: 
“Alexandre Pushkin, born in 


Moscow in 1799, killed in a duel 
at the age of thirty-seven years, is 
Russia’s greatest poet. Man and 
poet, he is one of those literary fig- 
ures that a tragic destiny has pro- 
foundly marked. 

“One should look at this strange 
visage, with traits recalling the 
Negro origin of the poet through 
his father; in the eyes, in the car- 
riage of the head, one can discern 
the enthusiasm, the suffering, the 
fire of a proud soul, the spirit of 
revolt broken. Pushkin was such a 
one, living in an epoch of darkness 
and blood. 

“Under the title of ‘Poems Revo- 
lutionaires’, V. Parnac has trans- 
latéd in ‘Les Revues’, a certain 
number of his poems of revolt and 
of despair which are of great in- 
terest. This is a collection which 
permits one to understand the soul 
of a great poet, tormented by life 
and by himself. 

“The Russia of today loves and 
reads Pushkin. One notes, how- 
ever, a turning of the Soviet youth 
towards the author of ‘Eugene 
Onieguine’. The editors of a great 
Russian review, Krasnaia Niva, 
are preparing for 1930 the publica- 
tion of the complete works of 
Pushkin, accompanied by com- 
mentaries and notes tending to a 
Marxist understanding of the great 
classic. A. V. Lunacharsky, in the 
preface, which we translate here 
explains the tragic greatness of the 
life and work of Pushkin, his role, 
his usefulness in revolutionary Rus- 
sia. It has seemed to us interest- 
ing to present to our readers this 
word of a Marxist critic of today, 
on the great poet of the past. It 
unites the Marxist precision with 
the delicate understanding of the 
charm and of the beauty of the 
work. As Lunacharsky says: ‘The 
critic ought not simply to press and 
classify his roses: he should also to 
inhale the perfume.” 






NE of our greatest writers; he 
was during his life, and he re- 


mains the same in our epoch. The 
fashion of appreciating him has varied, 
it is true, in the course of years, but we 
are beginning to study him now from 
a critical point of view. One recog- 


158 


nizes readily that from a purely esthetic 
point of view, he is an incomparable 
artist whom none have surpassed. A 
re-valuation does not apply then to the 
incontestable rank that the poet occu- 
pies, but it will be effective from the 
angle of a general revision of Art it- 
self and of the place and destination of 
Art in society. 

A beauty of form unsurpassed, vari- 
ety and depth assures his work a bril- 
liant perpetuity. His work never fails 
to pierce by its light the thick clouds 
which often menace it. 

It is not unusual to hear said: 
“Pushkin certainly is a great master of 
style; but as a thinker, in his concep- 
tion of the world, he is far inferior to 
the great poets of other peoples: Shakes- 
peare, Byron, Schiller, Goethe.”” With- 
out doubt the myth of Pushkin as mere- 
ly amusing himself and entertaining 
others by the “sweet chords of his lyre”’, 
has little by little defamed his reputa- 
tion. But it is incontestable that in 
Pushkin we possess a poet of extraordi- 
nary depth of thought and of feeling 
and one who in his domain does not fall 
below the greatest. 

The epoch in which we live is the 
great epoch in which one revises the 
values of the past. We enter into a 
period absolutely new, not only for the 
life of our country, but for all human- 
ity. We are firmly convinced that it 
is necessary to build upon the con- 
quests of the preceding generation, even 
though, from the class point of view, 
that generation is strange to us. We 
have no sympathy with detachment 
from everything that is old, and the 
glorification of futurism before every- 
thing is in serious opposition to Com- 
munist thought; but, on the other hand, 
we do not wish to kneel down before 
ancient values. We believe in a future 
more brilliant; we are sure to ap- 
proach a higher culture which will sur- 
pass all the summits that the ancient 
culture has given to the peoples. 

To arrive at this, let us abandon all 
reverence toward recognized authority. 
Let us revise, from a critical point of 
view, the treasure-house of human 
values, particularly our own judgments, 
and above all let us seize from this 
treasure that which is necessary for our 
forward march! It is thus, then, that 
our time understands Pushkin. 

Lenin, make note of this, loved 
Pushkin with a tenderness almost ex- 
alted. He eliminated evidently all that 
which is foreign to us in the poet and 
due to his epoch and his class; but 





he admired the beauty of Pushkin’s 
language; his music; his imagination; 
his palpitating sensitiveness and that 
tense thought which makes the richness 
of his work. 


Our Marxist literary critic is still 
young, especially in that which concerns 
Pushkin; at the same time one can af- 
firm that our epoch has already learned 
to project some light on the figure of 
the poet in his life and in his work. 


One can no longer now speak of a 
pretended “Hellenism” of Pushkin, of 
his “sunny serenity”, of his “felicity”, 
of his “happy nature”, etc. This was 
the thesis established by bourgeois 
thought and by education under the 
fist of the Czar, which was interested 
in making Pushkin the scholarly poet 
for children and young people, the fin- 
ished master of language and official 
Russian “Ornament” to put in the 
crown of governing Russia. 

One knows, however, that the 
Greeks themselves realized the tragedy 
of life, felt its weight, and recognized 
the terror of Fate. We discern then 
in Pushkin traits, sombre and even 
morbid, which let us understand his 
poignant cry: “Ah! Not to go mad!” 

Serenity? From his youth, Push- 
kin kept it, despite his troubled life, 
darkened by the trials he was put to 
and by political persecution. Towards 
the end of his life he was literally hunt- 
ed: a weight of debt on his neck; on 
his body, annoyances without number, 
literary, social, political; the dissatis-

faction with himself and his work ; the 
iron hand of absolutism “caressing the 
poet”, but cutting to the blood his 
dignity and his creative impulse. Push- 
kin fought against the innumerable 
“scandals” with which his enemies in- 
tentionally sowed his path; in his pow- 
erless fury, he hurled himself against 
the pack of hounds that tortured him; 
and finally he was physically destroyed 
by them. 

‘Official literary history likes to op- 
pose the “luminous Pushkin” to the 
“somber Lermontov”. Nothing is more 
false than this antithesis. Let us study 
more intimately the two poets: one will 
see with surprise the closeness of their 
natures, without speaking of the like- 
ness of their destinies. Their analogous 
social situation is clear: Pushkin, him- 
self belonged to that middle-class no- 
bility that regarded with anger and 
envy the arrogant and empty aristoc- 
racy of the great proprietors and high 
functionaries. Early this class so sur- 
rounded him that he could not help but 
look at it “sadly.” 

Early Pushkin spoke of “The evil 
of the century”, which tormented him 
and which Lermontov also would later 
strive to escape. ‘Thus this serenity ex- 


isted surely in Pushkin as in every rich 
nature which aspires to happiness; but 
it was nothing more than an attempt 
at consolation, at wide evasion of the 
sorrowful experiences to which he was 
subjected. 

The desire to avoid conflict with the 
government of Nicholas I., the desire to 
justify himself in some slight way in 
the face of stories of his conciliation 
with this nightmare régime; the desire 
to lose himself in abstract and peaceful 
imagination,—such desires lived always 
in the soul of the poet; they brought 
him calm at times, but in the long run, 
like a heavy burden, they broke the 
soul of Pushkin and this manifests it- 
self in every one of his works, often to 
the extent of disfiguring them. One 
understands then today that his life 
work called “Quiet Harmony”, is shot 
through with tragedy; as was true of 
Lermontov, of Gogol, (whom they 
wished, also, to make a stalking-horse) , 
of Dostoievsky and of others. 

One can only grasp the writer Push- 
kin by regarding him as a social phe- 
nomenon, by studying him according to 
the Marxist method. Marxism alone 
can discover the true meaning of the 
destinies of countries by studying the 





evolution and the decline of certain 
Know the economic and social 
evolution of the classes in our country, 
see its reflection in literature, this is 
truthfully to understand Pushkin, ap- 
preciate the place which he occupies, 
and penetrate. his work, each of his 
verses, each of his phrases. 

One ought to understand the contra- 
dictions of class which showed them- 
selves in the epoch of the poet; grasp 
the forces of the time and the position 
of Pushkin who always had a keen 
sense of the world in which he lived. 
He was the representative of one sec- 
tion of the nobility and of the move- 
ment that led this section to unite it- 
self little by little with the bourgeois. 
One can understand him best then by 
understanding the social significance of 
his works, and by getting the satisfac- 
tion of discovering a knowledge of that 
social sense in his work. 

Pushkin, once his work is estimated 
from a critical point of view, can and 
should become our contemporary, ‘our 
collaborator. Thus, .we lift from:him

given; thus, we permit him no longer

HE April edition of THE Crisis 
states that Muriel Draper wrote 
“Born To Be”. I am sorry that the 
seviewer is not sophisticated 
enough to understand more about life 
and its facts as they are from the in- 
side out. Perhaps then he can under- 
stand the interpreter of “Stand Still 
Jordan” better and know why I spoke 
of Nathaniel Dett’s work as I did in 
my book, Then he would not be so 
inclined to put a lot of blame on peo- 
ple who have nothing to do with the 
thoughts. Mr. Van Vechten and Mrs. 
raper are far more sympathetic to- 
ward the dark people of America than 
they are toward themselves. . Please 
correct the statement it was written by 
a white woman, Muriel Draper. Mrs. 
Draper simply edited the book and I 
earn that many great writer’s books 

are edited by someone else.

May, 1930 








Just a few lines in behalf of a col- 
ored young man who is detained in the 
criminal ward at St. Peter, Minnesota. 
I was just recently released or dumped 
from this asylum. I am of white par- 
ents, and I am not in any way biased 
against class, color or creed. You can 
do something for this young man. His 
name is William B. Bowens. He was 
sentenced to Stillwater Prison to serve 
five to forty years. He was trans- 
ferred to St. Peter a year ago this 
month. You can very easily get a com- 
mittee to investigate conditions, not 
only in the criminal ward but also the 
prisons, and you will find out that I 
am stating the truth. When I see con- 
ditions beyond human endurance, how 
I ever put up or existed is more than I 
can say. Life for the average prisoner 
is not very long. The food is not fit 
for any human being to eat. They re- 
duced me down to a skeleton from 195

pounds, so if they treated me in such 
a manner, what manner do you think 
they are treating some of those colored 
boys? 

This young man, Bowens, was good 
enough to fight for our country. Why 
not show him a little consideration of 
justice now? ‘There are more colored 
boys detained there beside Bowens. Of 
course, the majority are white but my 
white brothers did not show me no 
mercy. All I ask of you is don’t use

I have been a staunch supporter of 
Tue Crisis for 20 years. During the 
past 10 years, I have contributed $50 
per year to the N. A. A. C. P. I have 
been using copies of THe Crisis for 
class-room texts off and on for the 15 
years that I have been teaching in the 
local schools. My criticism, is there- 
fore, friendly. 

Please lighten up the tone of THE 
Crisis. It’s so heavy. So much eco- 
nomics and politics. Can’t you vary 
your make-up a little? Let us have a 
little more fiction—a little humor. 
“White Lilacs” was awful. Matney’s 
articles I suppose are good. But who 
reads them? The magazine that used 
to give us all so much pleasure here at 
school, has turned into a_ regular 
“blues” sheet. Other race publications 
are seizing your leadership. Liven up 
Tue Crisis, don’t keep it so heavy and 
dull. _

I have read and highly appreciate 
Professor W. C. Matney’s “Exploita- 
tion or Co-operation,” in the recent is- 
sues of our foremost magazine. I hope 
to see it in pamphlet form and wide 
distribution among us. We co-operate 
to build quarter - million dollar 
churches, fraternal homes and churches. 
All of which means all going out and 
nothing coming in. We are, therefore, 
exploited by our own religious, frater- 
nal and some financial leaders.

Although working but two days a 
week at the printing business and I 
have to make every penny count, I am 
sending in my renewal to THE Crisis 
which I have taken for some time. 

As a member of Typographical 
Union No. 6, I am sorry that the union 
label no longer appears in THE Crisis 
nor does it adorn any of your printed 
matter. Knowing your sympathy for 
the workers, organized and unor- 
ganized, I do feel disappointed. Of the 
many publications, I take yours is one 
of the few minus the label. 

I trust it will reappear in THE 
Crists. I naturally like to spend my 
union wages on the products of union 
labor where possible. 

Edward P. Clarke. 


I appreciate what you say concern- 
ing THe Crisis magazine and the 
union label. I regret to say that I 


160 


have entirely lost faith in the Ameri- 
can Federation of Labor and its atti- 
tude toward Negroes. For years, I 
have in the Crisis and on the platform, 
advocated the trade union movement, 
and while I berated the excluding of 
Negroes by trade unions, | tried to ex- 
plain it. The course of Green, how- 
ever, is indefensible, and until the trade 
union movement stands heartily and 
unequivocably at the side of Negro 
workers, I am through with it. I 
know that this attitude is a bit unfair 
to some unions who do admit the Ne- 
gro, but the attitude of most unions is 
such that I think I am justified. We 
print THe Crisis in a union shop, but 
it is almost impossible to get a black 
man into the Typographical Union. | 
know a few have been admitted but a 
very few. 

I trust you will understand this 
frank expression of opinion. 


The Editor 


After several days trial, it was my 
good fortune to secure from the public 
library here a copy of your “John 
Brown.” I have read it once and am 
about to read it again. Its eloquent 
tribute to John Brown transcends any- 
thing on the subject I have thus far 
read—and I have been fortunate in 
securing much good material. The in- 
terpretation of the Soul of John Brown 
—the thought behind the act—could 
come only from a man of the race with 
real understanding. I regret exceed- 
ingly that the book is out of print but 
if I can continue to arouse interest in 
it in the future as I have in the past 
few days since reading the book, I feel 
certain that the demands for copies will 
force the supply. I hope so anyway. 

| have for some time been convinced, 
Dr. Du Bois, that the Negro has not 
done justice to the memory of John 
Brown and whatever his excuses may 
have been in the past, they can no 
longer remain in the face of his boasted 
intellectual and cultural advancement. 

Fredericka D. Perry,

May a white girl subscribe to THE 
Crisis? I am an assistant in the Oak- 
land Free Library and for the last six 
months have been engaged in compiling 
a bibliography of material, in our li- 
brary, by Negroes. The list is almost 
finished now, but I feel that I shall 
need a Negro journal or two to keep 
me in touch with what Negroes are 
doing. 

I have worked with more earnestness 
at this list than anything I have ever 
done, because it has opened up an en- 
tirely new world for me: a world of 
men who have accomplished glorious 
deeds in the face of tremendous odds. 
Being personally free from prejudice 





against any other race, nationality or 
class, I had no idea that any people 
could be so blind and narrow and un. 
speakably cruel as my race has been to 
yours. I blush to say “my race” to yoy 
whose “Litany at Atlanta” moved me 
so deeply. I have been moved to many 
moods by the words of your race: ex. 
alted by the proud lines of Langston 
Hughes, who finds the faces of his peo- 
ple so beautiful, stirred immeasurably 
by the tender lines of Countée Cullen's 
“Brown Girl Dead,” and filled with 
disgust and bitterness against my race 
by Walter White’s “Rope and Faggot” 
and other such books that reveal our 
ugliness as it is. I wish I could atone, 
in some way, for being white “in a day 


like this.”

I am just now in receipt of a letter 
from Mrs. Todd, who is at our home 
in Michigan, informing me that in the 
March number of THE Crisis there 
is a paragraph stating, among other 
things, that I am a West African. | 
am an American—a native of Peters- 
burg, Virginia, and am so known by 
all here. I am not objecting so much 
to being called or known as a West 
African, but if there is any credit due 
our people in the States by reason of 
the fact that I was unanimously elected 
as Chairman of the Executive Commit- 
tee of the Panama Canal Bar Associa- 
tion, an Association composed mostly of 
white men, I certainly desire our people 
in the States to get that credit.

On page 120 of the April Crisis, 
Captain W. F. Lucas says: “The Fif- 
teenth Regiment, New York Guard, 
came into existence in 1915 by legis- 
lative act. . . . Colonel William Hay- 
ward organized the regiment in 1916 
and led it to France in 1917.” To this 
statement you append a footnote read- 
ing: “There was delay in organizing 
the regiment because Governor Smith 
refused to appoint a Negro colonel, 
(Editor)” 

Alfred E. Smith's first election to 
the Governorship of New York took 
place in November, 1918. He assumed 
office January 1, 1919. 

I know that you think Governor 
Smith hostile, or at any rate, com- 
pletely indifferent to Negro rights. But 
in this instance at least you have, 0 
course, through a mere slip of memory,

THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 


THE MACHINE STARTS 


MOVING 


T is a big machine. It extends over 
| an area of thousands of miles. It 
reaches into big cities and the smallest 
of backwoods towns. Its representa- 
tives enter the chief buildings of the 
United States Government, conferring 
there with the executives of the nation. 
They go into courts, they speak to gov- 
ernors, mayors and editors, they corre- 
spond with interested and influential 
persons in all parts of the world. It is 
a machine that is constantly at work. 
To keep it at work requires an immense 
correspondence, by letter, by travelling 
officers, by telegraph. 

It is the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People which 
I have reference to. It has almost 
100,000 members. Dean Pickens once 
remarked that you couldn’t ignore 100,- 
000 ants, let alone 100,000 people. But 
to get them, or even a fraction of them, 
to move in concert toward a common 
focus, is a huge job. 

That was the job confronting the 
National Office when it was proposed 
this year to conduct a_ nation-wide 
Moorfield Storey - Louis Marshall 
Memorial Campaign. The time was 
limited. The outside limit for results 
to be obtained and shown was the date 
of the opening of the Association’s 21st 
Annual Spring Conference in Spring- 
field, Massachusetts, on June 25. So 
concentrated labor was necessary, and 
still is. It is necessary in order that 
results may be shown worthy of the 
two dead leaders who so unselfishly and 
generously gave of their time, their 
outstanding ability, and their means to 
further the work for which the N. A. 
A. C. P. was founded and exists. 

Now the machine has actually 
started moving. From one city after 
another come the reports that memorial 
meetings have been undertaken, that 
the literature printed by the National 
Office is desired for distribution, that 
prominent citizens both white and col- 
ored are entering with enthusiasm into 
the work of commemorating the work 
done by Moorfield Storey and Louis 
Marshall in a way they would have 
wished it commemorated : by making it 
possible for that work to go on. 

Not least among the people who have 
put their shoulder to the wheel of this 
immense machine, are the colored edi- 
tors of the country. These editors are 
scattered all over the United States. 


May, 1930 








Spingarn Medal 


The 16th Spingarn Medal, pre- 
sented annually for most distin- 
guished achievement by an Ameri- 
can of African descent, will again 
be given at the 21st Annual Con- 
ference in Springfield, Mass., of 
the N. A. A. C. P. 

Do you know any colored 
man or woman who has done 


outstanding work in the arts, in 
science, in business, in military 


service, on land or sea. If so, you 
may nominate him or her for this 
year’s award. 

Send the name of your nominee, 
together with brief life history and 
a statement of the work or 
achievement meriting the award, 
to Bishop John Hurst, chairman 
Spingarn Award Committee, 69 
Fifth Avenue, New York, N. Y. 
The time is short so act at once, 
if you want your nomination to 
have ample consideration. 





Some of them preside over large week- 
ly newspapers with a circulation of 
hundreds of thousands. Some of them 
publish a tiny sheet in a small com- 
munity, to keep their readers in touch 
with what is going on of interest to 
all Negroes. The N. A. A. C. P. has 
often occasion to call upon these colored 
editors for help. And help they give, 
generously. I would like to show the 
kind of help that is being given to the 
Moorfield Storey-Louis Marshall Cam- 
paign by quoting in its entirety an edi- 
torial that was published in the New 
York Amsterdam News of March 26. 
That is not the only editorial that 
colored editors have written. There 
have been others and doubtless there 
will be more. But it well represents 
the spirit in which colored editors back 
up the N. A. A. C. P. So I will let 
the editor of the Amsterdam News 
have the floor for a moment as fol- 
lows: 
Storey and Marshall 


The National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People is about to 
start a campaign for a memorial to the 
late Moorfield Storey and Louis Mar- 
shall. There are no two men of recent 
times more deserving of grateful re- 
membrance by the Negro. Eminently 
successful in their own race and careers, 
they went out of their way to befriend 
a race to which they owed nothing, for 
the sole reason that they were big enough, 


me 


knightly enough, to wish to bring about 
Theodore Roosevelt’s famous ideal— 
“All men up and no men down”. 

The coming drive should have the sup- 
port of every Negro with a spark of 
gratitude in him. Moorfield Storey and 
Louis Marshall won five important vic- 


tories for the Negro in the United 
States Supreme Court. Mr. Storey 


fought successfully for the decision that 
ended Negro disfranchisement by the no- 
torious Grandfather Clause; he won the 
Louisville Segregation case; his argu- 
ment in the famous Arkansas case saved 
twelve innocent Negroes from death and 
sixty-seven from long prison terms. Mr. 
Marshall won the Texas White Primary 
case; he prepared and argued the case 
against the insertion of clauses in prop- 
erty deeds forbidding rental or sale to 
Negroes; at the time of his death he was 
preparing a case to test Southern legis- 
lation which sought to circumvent the 
Supreme Court’s decision in the Texas 
White Primary case. 

Let it not be forgotten that one of the 
best ways to honor such men is to help 
carry on the work from which they were 
taken by death. The National Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People is one organization that should 
never be allowed to suffer for lack of 
funds. 

An editorial like that is not only 
grease to the wheels but gasoline for 
the tank of the big machine that is the 
N. A. A. C. P. It shows that the 
editor who wrote it not only knows 
how to write good English but that 
he is a friend and participant in the 
Association’s work. That is true of 
many colored editors throughout the 
United States. Upon them devolves 
very largely the task of keeping col- 
ored people informed of what is hap- 
pening, so that they can act together. 

And now, with such help as the 
editors are constantly giving, the ma- 
chine is actually under way. In one 
city of New York State, Rochester, the 
branch was not content merely with a 
memorial meeting to honor the memory 
of Messrs. Storey and Marshall. At 
that meeting, in addition, the branch 
pledged itself, through its president, ex- 
Congressman Jacobstein, to seeks in- 
dustrial opportunities for colored men 
and women in that city, so that they 
would have equal opportunity with 
white people, on the job. That is con- 
crete action in the direction in which 
Messrs. Storey and Marshall were go- 
ing. 

Other branches have invited leading 
white and colored citizens to meet to-

“DRAMATIS PERSONAE” | 





| 


GREEN PASTURES 

Slowly but with unerring certainty 
the American public is being led to- 
ward the bitter but reviving waters of 
the life history of the American Negro. 
They have long refused to quaff this 
sour and shuddering draught. They 
have even denied its existence. They 
still shrink at the rush of its turbulent 
waters. They have clamored for broad 
tarce, and then compromised with 
rollicking comedy. And then grad- 
ually, very gradually, they have ap- 
proached the great and human stream. 

One easily may trace the footsteps 
from “nigger” minstrels up to “Ban- 
danna Land”; from “The Red Moon” 
to “Lulu Belle’; and then, the grad- 
ual climbing over “Deep River” to 
“Hallelujah”; and now to the broad 
and tenderly alluring .““Green Past- 
ures’, 

It is difficult for the Negro audience 
to judge a play for themselves. Most 
of us lack clear standards. What do 
we want in a play? A picture of our- 
selves as we would like to seem? A 
picture of ourselves as some of us are? 
Or a caricature of Negro life as today 
it is certainly not? Yet all these 
things can be portrayed upon the stage 
in an artistic way, and if the result is 
artistic, the play has a right to be 
given. 

All art is propaganda, and without 
propaganda there is no true art. But, 
on the other hand, all propaganda is 
not art. Indeed, most of it is not. 
Most complaints, curses, arguments 


and facts are not at all artistically done 
and are not meant to be, no matter 


i’ 








Richard Harrison 


how true they may be. But, on the 
other hand, if a person portrays ideal 
Negro life, the sole judgment of its 
success is whether the picture is a 
beautiful thing. He can not be criti- 
cized simply because white folk think 
the facts untrue or the ideal unde- 
sirable. Or, on the other hand, if he 
caricatures Negro life, and makes it 
sordid and despicable, the critic’s cri- 
terion is not whether the work is com- 
plete or true to life, but solely, Is the 
idea well presented? Is the comedy 
genial and satisfying? The artist can 
not be criticized simply because it is 
caricature, although the public and the 
press may certainly be criticized for 
saying, as many said of Porgy—‘this 






“Out of the land of Egypt; out of the House of Bondage” 


Ss 


is a picture of typical Negro life!” No 
it was not, but it was a beautiful play, 
Or, if the picture of Negro life while 
true enough is incomplete, neverthe- 
less, the measure of success is its artis- 
try and not its completeness. The 
black world does rightly complain that 
white folk insist on judging art as 
truth and then refusing to accept or 
see or read any artistic work which 
does not portray the truth as they 
want it. This cripples the souls of 
white folk, but it does not make “Hal- 
lelujah” one whit less a fine movie. 
The difficulty, of course, with the 
Negro on the American stage, is that 
the white audience, on the one hand, 
demands caricatures and farces, and 
the Negro, on the other hand, either 
cringes to the demand because he needs 
the pay, or bitterly condemns every 
Negro book or show what does not 
paint colored folk at their best. Their 
criticisms should be aimed at the in- 
completeness of art expression; at the 
embargo which white wealth lays on 
full Negro expression—and a full pic- 
turing of the Negro soul. On the 
other hand, the white audience right- 
ly protests by refusal to listen to 
things that are not artistic, even 
though they may be complete and true. 
All these difficulties are being slowly 
overcome. In “Green Pastures”, Marc 
Connelly has made an extraordinarily 
appealing and beautiful play based on 
the folk religion of Negroes. Some 
whites will not like it because it is 
too human and tragic with all its 
humor. But more Negroes will view

Ode to Unemployment 
By C. M. CUNNINGHAM 
EZEKIAH BROWN arose at early 


dawn 
To walk the streets in search of some 
employment. 
He plied his quest from factory to fact’ry 
And enquired at each one 
If they might have use for him. 


Night fell ; 
And still he had found nothing, 
But turned his leaden footsteps 
Homeward ; 

Not despairing, yet not hopeful. 


Next day he ‘rose 

And followed ’most the same procedure, 

Except that in the early afternoon 

He had decided that ’twould not be 
worth while 

To inquire any further. 

He’d wait until the morrow and begin 
afresh. 


The next day followed and the next, 

Each day becoming shorter than the 
former, 

While ’t seemed to him he 
slack’d his efforts 

But in reality he was just wandering 

In hope that Chance might place him in 
a way to find a job. 


had not 


Yet time elapsed 

And Chance has not been generous. 

Today you'll find him standing 

At Thirtieth and South State Streets, 

And you perhaps would think him just a 
loafer. 


However, if the truth were known, 

‘Twould seem that he’s still hoping 

That Chance has not deserted him en- 
tirely, 

But will some day procure him 

Some employment. 

And he’ll again become respectable.

By VIRGINIA HOUSTON 


AM so tired 
Waiting for my heart to break, 
Waiting for tears to heal my soul, 
For a blessed hand to melt away 
he agony within me. 


Aeons since you went from me 

Into an alien world. And still 

Stranger to beauty are all my days, 

My nights dark makings of libations 
here once the myrtle grew! 


May, 1930 





I could carry the weight of winter, 
The glory of autumn nights and days, 
But I cannot bear the spring. 

And I am ill, unto death, my Beloved! 
Sick with longing, sick with weeping, 
Waiting for my heart to break.’ 


To Mother 
By JOHN H. OWENS 
ISTEN, O brown, kind mother, 


I am weary and I would rest; 
Put your old, warm arms about me, 
Let me lie on your withered breast. 


I am very sick of cities— 

Of faces cold and strange— 

I long for your sun-washed spaces, 
Blue skies and wind-swept range. 


I am sick of the huddled houses, 
And the selfish hearts of men: 
Put your warm, kind arms about me, 
Let me lie on your heart again.

s6\VOU cannot hate the man you 
know”, 

You'll find this adage true, 

A certain sympathy is born 

When men draw close to you. 


You only hate the thing that’s strange, 
The man who dwells apart— 

But no one understands, and hates, 
Another human heart. 


For when you know his travail, 
Know his secret hopes and fears, 
He’s just another comrade 

To march with you down the years! 


Black Man 
By HEBA JANNATH 


HE has plowed and planted cotton 
Has picked it by the ton 

He has bred and slaughtered cattle 
Beneath a scorching sun. 


He has garnered in the rice fields 
And harvested the grain 
He has held the breaking levees 


Against the hurricane. 


He has laid the Southern highways 
Thru swamps and over hills 

He has mined for coal deposits 
To run the Southern mills. 





He has blasted in the subway 

And labored on the docks 

He has cooked in countless kitchens 
And builded city blocks. 


He has fought his country’s battles 
Has answered ev’ry call 

And has shed his blood that Freedom 
Might be the lot of All. 


He has fashioned gallant rhythms 
Of love and life and loss 

He has set the world to dancing 
And died upon a cross. 


And yet, they say he’s not a man 
Not equal to the rest 

What, we ask, is Manhood 

If this be not the test? 


Poems 
By BESSIE MAYLE 


IGHT is like an avalanche 
Sliding down the sky. 
It covers me with black and gold 
While other shades stand by. 


Blackest nights show up the 
Stars of yellow gold; 

Royal stars which prove to be 
Very, very old. 


stars— 


White against a sheen of black 
Shows the finest lines, 
Showing too the falser tones 
The finer ones entwine. 


Background shades are ruling shades, 
And for the world it’s black— 

You can find it in the east 

And on the jungle’s track. 


What does it matter if white lights 
Can boast their rays before— 
Brightest days burn out themselves, 
And night rules evermore. 


Skylines 
ARE marking me in today, 


Like huge arms 
The mountains hold my valley in, 
And many an age goes by. 


Huge things are jealous things— 
Like mountains— 

Locking me in 

And the world out. 


Huge things are silly things— 
Like mountains— 

Locking out the world’s eye, 

Forgetting all about the stars.

HE press reports regarding the 

shooting of women by the British 
Government in Opobo, Nigeria, West 
Africa, censored as they have been, 
still show a growing resentment of the 
native population against the colonial 
autocracy of Great Britain. The 
shooting of unarmed women in cold 
blood is certainly a form of barbarism. 
When a power like Great Britain per- 
mits such an exhibition of savagery, it 
merely demonstrates that talks of 
World Peace, of the Kellogg Pact and 
of the League of Nations are plati- 
tudes. 

The trouble with Nigeria arose over 
a poll tax, that is, a head tax which it 
was attempted to piace upon women 
as well as men. The poll tax in 
Africa is a method of forcing the na- 
tives to labor. The combination of 
confiscating the land and making the 
native pay $5 or $10 a year as a tax 
in cash will often reduce a tribe to 
virtual slavery. This is the case of 
Kenya. In Nigeria, on the other hand, 
the natives still retain title to their 
lands. The dominion of Great Britain 
over many tribes who for one thousand 
years have been their own masters and 
maintained great states is recent and 
by: no means complete. The so-called 
indirect method of government is in 
vogue. That is, the British rule 
through the chiefs, but the chiefs are 
either appointed by the British, or if 
they are elected, must be subservient 
to the District Commissioner or lose 
their office. Thus on the iron hand 
of British power is the velvet glove of 
a native chieftancy. 

When now the Resident of Owerri 
Province recently ordered a District 
Officer of Opobo District to collect 
taxes from the people trading in the 
markets, trouble arose. Most of these 
traders were women. For decades 
they had made use of these markets 
without paying taxes for their stalls— 
indeed, according to native law and 
custom, the market place was com- 
munal and could be used freely by 
those who wished. On the other hand, 
the British needed more revenue and 
ordered it collected. 

Representatives of the British Gov- 
ernment in the Nigerian Civil Ser- 
vice are not familiar usually with the 
native dialects, and must employ inter- 
preters. Few of these interpreters are 
educated and their knowledge of Eng- 
lish is usually poor. Nevertheless 
these interpreters stand between the 
British and the mass of natives. This 
gives them prestige and power. It en-

dinary massacre of Negro women 
in the British West African colony 
of Nigeria is not yet clear and may 
never be, despite the fact of at 
least two “official” investigations. 


The following article is written by 
a native of Nigeria, studying in the 
United States. The Editor has 
taken the liberty of correcting the 
author’s manuscript in certain re- 
spects and adding certain explana- 
tions. 





ables them to prey on the ignorance of 
the natives and to act as stool-pigeons 
and lackeys for the whites. On the 
other hand, the white cadets and assist- 
ant district officers are high school 
graduates, or appointed from army re- 
serves. Only a few of them are edu- 
cated men. They have usually not 
even rudimentary knowledge of politi- 
cal science, law, or social development. 
Thus, between the higher officials and 
and the mass of the natives stand two 
vitiating influences—the untrained 
white officials, and the interpreters. 

The natives of Opobo belong to the 
Ibo tribe and speak a variation of the 
Ibo language, called Kwa-Ibo. The 
original Ibo is spoken in Onitsha, the 
center of the Ibo country. The Ibo 
tribes, together with the Hausa and 
the Yoruba people are the largest 
tribes in Nigeria, and in the delta dis- 
tricts of Southern Nigeria, Ibo has be- 
come the lingua Franca. The Ibos 
themselves are a war-like tribe dating 
from the sixteenth century, but after 
civil war in Benin they migrated and 
settled on the east side of the river 
Niger. 

Missionaries and explorers invaded 
Southern Nigeria in the early nine- 
teenth century. Among them were 
Laird, Lander, Mungo ‘Park, and 
Barth. There were bloody expeditions 
and massacres for sixty years. Riots, 
insurrections, and risings took place 
until at last in 1900, Colonel Freder- 
ick Lugard, now Lord Lugard, was 
victorious and declared the 335,000 
square miles of Nigeria a colonial de- 
pendency of Great Britain. In 1914, 
Southern Nigeria, Northern Nigeria, 
and Lagos Colony were amalgamated 
to form the Colony and Protectorate 
of Nigeria. 

Since 1900, the British have tried 
to pacify the natives, and many of them 
are receiving some education and train- 
ing in Western economic ideas. Nev- 


ertheless they retain many of their 
ideals of personal liberty, and these, 
from time to time, have caused open 
ruptures with Great Britain. There 
were, for instance, the Ekumeku ris. 
ings, the Enugu rebellion, and the Ojl 
River expedition. While the chiefs 
retained their power, yet the people of 
Nigeria had no voice in British Admin- 
istration until 1923. By the incessant 
agitation of the leaders of the Na- 
tional Congress of British West 
Africa, limited franchise was granted 
to four West African colonies. Un- 
der this provision, the Negroes elect a 
minority of the Legislative Council, 
and Opobo is represented in the Coun- 
cil by two chiefs and the Honorable 
F. C. Obianwu. Naturally the na- 
tives are not satisfied with this, be- 
cause the British Official Majority can 
at any time over-ride the native minor- 
ity; moreover the chief must be sub- 
servient. 

The recent Opobo massacre was due 
to the poorly qualified political officers 
of the Civil Service, and the lack of 
any chance of conference and under- 
standing between the mass of people 
and the British rulers. In 1925 a simi- 
lar incident took place in Calabar, 
twenty-five miles from Opobo. The 
District Officer ruled there that the 
women of various tribes must pay poll 
tax. The chiefs did not understand 
the ruling and the women, therefore, 
went to their usual stalls the next day, 
and were driven out by the police. 
They held a mass meeting and sent a 
petition to the white British Resident 
of Calabar Province. The Resident 
Was away on tour and his assistant re- 
fused to receive the petition. He or- 
dered the chiefs to command the wom- 
en to obey the law and make com- 
plaint afterward. The chiefs ob- 
jected on the ground that the women 
had no right of suffrage and were not 
represented in the Town Council; also 
they insisted on the communal owner- 
ship of the markets. The District 
Officers drove them out of his office. 
The women became enraged, staged a 
demonstration and attacked the shops 
of the white merchants. Over 5000 
of them marched though the streets of 
Calabar. 

Immediately the District Officer or- 
dered the Commanding Officer of the 
Calabar Unit of the Nigerian Regt 
ment to quell the riot. The Officer 
refused to obey him saying that his 
Majesty’s soldiers were not trained to 
fight against women, and that he was

some time she was instructor at St. 
Augustine’s School, Raleigh, N. C. 
and at the Deaf, Dumb and Blind In- 
stitute. For the past fourteen years 
she has been organist at St. Phillip’s 


Church, Newark, N. J. She was a 
persistent, brilliant and — unselfish 
worker. 


@ It is easy to forget that the meth- 
ods of instruction at West Point in- 
clude a detachment from the Ninth 
U. S. Regiment which is composed of 
colored Cavalry. The first colored 
Regulars to be stationed at the Aca- 
demy came in 1907 and consisted of 
100 men. There are now 189 priv- 
ates. ‘The Superintendent of the Aca- 
demy says that “these men are most 
excellent soldiers and perform their 
duty with enthusiasm and_ pleasing 
cheerfulness.” Among them are 28 
non-commissioned officers. They have 
a polo team which regularly beats the 
cadets, besides basketball, football, 
baseball, track and field, and tug-of- 
war teams. They usually form an 
escort of honor for the President and 
members of the Cabinet, for foreign 
potentates, and recently for the Hon- 
orable Oscar DePriest, member of 
Congress from Illinois. 
@ Mrs. Frances Boyce has been Pres- 
ident of the Board of Directors of the 
Phyllis Wheatley Y. W. C. A., Wash- 
ington, D. C., for fifteen years. It 
was largely through her determined 
efforts that the building on 9th St. 
and Rhode Island Avenue N. W., was 
secured from the War Work Council 
She was with the Y. W. C. A. through 
all its early stages when it had a four 
room house on 414 St., S. W., and 
twelve-room place on “T”’ St. with 
just a housekeeper in charge. At that 
time Mrs. Boyce had to give most of 
her time to the Association day and 
night. 
When the new building was erected 
the biggest Campaign of the Y. W. 
A. was staged and the largest 
amount ever raised among our group 
for one organization was realized.

There were many predictions of course 
that the building was too large a prop- 
osition for the women in Washington 
to handle. With Mrs. Boyce at the 
helm, the Phyllis Wheatley has gone 
steadily on and today, although there 
have been larger and more modern 
buildings erected, none are regarded 
as more beautiful than Phyllis Wheat- 
ley of Washington, D. C. 

“Mrs. Boyce has always been first 
to contribute to every cause, both she 
and her husband having given thous- 
ands of dollars to this particular work. 
During the present Community Chest 
campaign, she solicited $3,975. Mrs. 
Bovce has studied the work and at- 
tended many conferences; she has been 
referred to by a National Y. W. C. A. 
secretary as one of the best presidents 
in Association work. On account of 
the illness of her husband, Mrs. Boyce 
has resigned as President of the Board 
of Directors, but will remain as a 
member. 
@ Thomas E. Miller of South Caro-

cation at Lincoln University and is a 
lawyer. He served in the Senate of 
South Carolina and afterward in the 
House. When elected to Congress his 
seat was contested by William Elliot, 
but he eventually won the contest. In 
the South Carolina Constitutional 
Convention of 1894, Miller was a 
prominent member and fought hard to 
keep the Negroes from being disfran- 
chised. He is at present living in 
Pennsylvania.

@ Dr. John M. T. Eagan is dead at 
Belize, British Honduras. He was 
born there in 1878 and trained at 
Chicago University, and-McGill. He 
was held in high esteem for his pro- 
fessional ability and his personal gifts. 
He was the only native Negro physi- 
cian in the country. 


WEST AFRICA 


@ The conviction of Dr. Benjamin 
Knowles who was charged with mur- 
der and tried without jury in British 
West Africa, has been quashed by the 
Privy Council in London. They give 
many legal reasons, but the real rea- 
son is that Knowles is a white man. 
Black men in Africa have been con- 
victed and hanged frequently without 
jury trial. 

@ During the year 1929 produce of 
Belgian Congo was landed at Ant- 
werp to the value of 884,977,000 Bel- 
gian francs. It consisted chiefly of 
copper, palm nuts, cotton, copal gum, 
and palm oil. 

@ It is reported that there is a com- 
mercial crisis in Liberia arising from 
a combination of European merchants 
to fix prices for raw materials. The 
Government owes these merchants a 
sum reported to be $147,000 and is 
not in a position to pay at present. 
@ Ephriam G. Taylor, African 
Assistant Treasurer of Sierra Leone is 
dead. He was born in 1877 and en- 


tered the Treasury Department in 
1902. 


EAST AFRICA 


@ Dr. Leo Frobenius is convinced

that the ruins of Zimbabwe date from 
a period 1000 or 4000 years before 
Christ. He has visited India and finds 
ruins there which parallel those in 
Africa. This with other evidence leads 
him to class the civilization of Zim- 
babwe as Sumerian. Frobenius did not 
add the fact that the Sumerians were 
undoubtedly black. 

@ A fine new railway station was 
dedicated with solemn pomp at the 
capital city of Ethiopia last December. 
In front of it stands a monument to 
the late Emperor Menelik which is 
surmounted by a lion and has medal- 
lions on the side representing the Em- 
peror and Empress, the present King 
Ras Tafari and his father. The depot 
represents the terminus of the French 
railway from Djibouti. 

@ Heretofore unknown ruins have 
been discovered in Portguguese East 
Africa. They are surrounded by stone 
walls and contain traces of circular

bronze implements were also found. 


SOUTH AFRICA 


@ A native demonstration against the 
Riotus Assembly Bill led the House 
of Parliament at Capetown to be 
guarded by squads of police with fixed 
bayonets and gas bombs. 


@ The Joint Session of the Parlia- 
ment of the Union of South Africa has 
shown that the problem of the native 
overshadows every other subject. 

@ Prime Minister Hertzog has in- 
troduced a bill to give white women 
suffrage throughout South Africa. This 
for the first time raises discrimination 
in the franchise requirements of 
Cape Province. There the present re- 
quirements for voting are $250 a year 
in wages or property of equal value; 
there is no discrimination between 
white and colored.

BOOKS 


OHN COTTON DANA has been 

at the head of the free public library 
of Newark, New Jersey, since 1902. 
His advice about books, published in 
1929, is worth the reading of all young 
people. We venture to extract a few 
paragraphs: 

“Everyone should buy books. By 
that I mean that every person of intel- 
ligence, able to read ordinary print 
withrsome ease, will find that the habit 
of owning looks and having them about 
him will give him more pleasure in the 
long run than any other habit he can 
form. Only a few buy and read 
books, to be sure; but then, only a few 
get out of life all the pleasure they are 
capable of getting. 

“But you may say you rarely read in 
books, and so why buy any? 

“Well, to this there are several an- 
swers. One is that books make fine 
furnishings. They do good to the room 
they stand in. They give your house 
an air, and you are obliged to breathe 
that air! Then, too, they are tempt- 
ing. Who knows when you will yield 
to the temptation to enjoy books if 
they are always at hand? 

“What books shall I buy? Buy 
what you like. It’s the same rule, you 
see, as the Great rule about Reading! 
Often one knows the kinds of books 
he likes, when he reads them; but does 
not know how to find more of that 
kind. 

“This trouble it is easy to get ’round 
by asking the public library. 

“Shall I get a big dictionary? When 
the time comes, yes. But first get 
books that you or your family or both 
like to read. If ther> are children 
about, you will find they use diction- 
aries in school, and you will wish to 
keep ahead of them by having a pretty 
good dictionary at home. If the fam- 
ily has the habit of talking about words 
and their exact meaning and how to 
pronounce, get a dictionary, surely! 

“But you can begin with quite a 
small one. Some of the small ones are

very good and vastly interesting to 
look into. 


“Shall I buy an encyclopaedia? If 
you are the encyclopaedia kind of a 
man, yes. And when the children be- 
gin to pass the ten-year mark you 
should have one for them to pull down 
and handle as they will. But it is easy 
to waste good book money on an en- 
cyclopaedia. There are many kinds 
and the best one for you is the one, 
that, among those you can afford, you 
will use most. 


“Shall I buy ‘Complete Works?’ 
No! Buy the books you want of any 
given author, and no more. You need 
not buy twenty volumes by one writer 
for the sake of getting the three that 
are all you care to read. The Com- 
plete Works Habit shows its effects on 
too many homes already. Rows of all 
that Brown, Jones, Robinson, Smith 
and other great authors ever wrote, not 
omitting what is worthless and includ- 
ing often his private and useless letters 
and a life by a commonplace friend— 
these glare through the glass doors of 
their cases in thousands of homes, and 
declare their unused uselessness by 
their bright and shiny look. In few 
homes are read the complete works of 
anybody. 

“What shall I say to book agents? 
A very good rule is to say that you buy 
all your boks at the stores. Another is 


to say that you don’t talk book buying 
at home. Another, that you never buy 
on first look or half looks, and that if 
he will send to you the complete thing 
he has to see and leave it with you for 
a week, you will give him a written de- 
cision. Another is that his book will 
soon be on sale, and much cheaper, sec- 
ond-hand, in the bookstores. This js 
true of 90 per cent of the book agent’s 
wares.” 


Would you kindly let me know 
if there is an organization or a 
foundation such as the Rockefeller 
Foundation that enables colored chil- 
dren to go to college. I want very 
very much to go to college. However, 
have not been able to do so because 
my parent is not able. 

I have heard that there was such 
an organization that helped children 
to go through college and allowed the 
children to pay them back after they 
had finished. I would even work in 
the summer time and pay back that 
way. 

Please, sir, let this letter be confi- 


dential. Thank you for all you do 
for this matter. Hoping to hear from 
you soon. 


I notice that a Junior section is 
running in the Crisis. 

Mr. A. O. Porter, of Hampton In- 
stitute, makes an interesting suggestion 
in re “The Hampton Tours” to Ev- 
rope: 

That we might get some one to put 
up the money to offer a “Scholarship” 
or tour to a Junior (about $440). 
This would stimulate Junior activity, 
both in THe Crisis and in Junior 
Divisions. 

The problem is, the money. But it 
would be a thing of great interest if 
some benevolent person could offer an 
N. A. A. C. P. Junior a trip to Europe 
and back with one of these tours,— 
for favorable competition of some 
kind over a given competitive period. 

Perhaps the Madam C. J. Walker 
Co. or the Poro Company might take 
to such a suggestion.

“MY PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE” 


“Our Birth is but a sleep and a for- 
getting: 

The Soul that rises with us, our life’s 
star 

Hath had elsewhere it’s setting 

And cometh from afar: 

Not in entire forgetfulness 

And not in utter nakedness 

But trailing clouds of glory do we come 

From God who is our home.” 


I have such a peculiar, muddled phi- 
losophy of life that it is almost impos- 
sible for me to put it into words. How- 
ever, the above poetry expresses part 
of it more beautifully than I can. 
Most of us believe in a life hereafter, 
and, if that is so, why should there not 
be a life before? I am convinced, as 
Wordsworth is, that as babes we still 
know the glory that was before; and to 
me it seems that that glory stays with 
us, though dimly interpreted in our 
Soul. Why else should we _ have 
dreams—always of perfection in one 
way or another? Why should we be 
overcome with an unutterable longing 
—a sense of tears—a need to bow 
down when something of exquisite 
beauty confronts us, if not because we 
remember the same beauty in the life 
that was; we desire it in the life to 
come. 

Our earthly existence is in more 
than a phase, in order that we may 
acquire the gift of tears and therefore 
know to a fuller extent the sweetness 
of the life before and the glory of the 
same life hereafter. 

What that ethereal realm, that was 
and shall be, is like I know not. But 
high upon the hills, while breathing 
the fragrance of green leaves and 
sleeping flowers, while gazing at the 
diamond-gleaming azure above me, 
there comes a whisper. 

_ Lam it.” Or if I let the wind play 
with my hair and the earth delight 
to feel the touch of my bare feet, if 
overcome with ecstasy I stretch my 


May, 1930 


hands to the caressing sun, then I hear 


the words, “I am it.” And again, 
when standing by the infinite ocean I 
let the waves splash high to kiss my 
lips, there comes the knowledge, “I 
am it.” 

Oh, grasping, seeking, foolish mortal 
that I am! Perhaps all this shall be 








there—perhaps none. At least this 
earthly life takes me to the lowest of 
all depths and allows me a glimpse 
of a few high pinnacles so that when I 
return to “God who is my Home” I 
shall know the infinite glories of His 
mountains.

ARCHIBALD H. GRIMKE 


HE Board of Directors of the Na- 

tional Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People records with 
profound regret the passing of the Hon- 
orable Archibald H. Grimké, who as 
President of the District of Columbia 
Branch of the N, A. A. C. P., as mem- 
ber of the National Board of Direc- 
tors, and as Vice-President of the Asso- 
ciation, aided so materially in the work 
of the N. A. A. C. P. to remove bar- 
riers from the path of the Negro. 
America and the Negro have suffered 
a grievous loss in the passing of this dis- 
tinguished citizen who served his coun- 
try and race so brilliantly and unsel- 
fishy. 

The Board of Directors instructs 
that this expression of regret and of 
condolence to Mr. Grimkeé’s family be 
spread upon its minutes and copies of it 
be transmitted to the family and to the 
press, and printed in THE Crisis. 


VIRGINIA 


T is with difficulty that one keeps 

from laughing over the plight of 
Virginia and its “race purity” legisla- 
tion. For something like 311 years, 
whites, Negroes and Indians have been 
inter-marrying and inter-mingling in 
this state. Recently, the Legislature 
has been trying to unscramble the races, 
and some papers, like the Times-Dis- 
patch, are getting quite hysterical about 
it. Essex County, for instance, has a 
number of “colored” children in the 
white schools—that is, children in 
whom experts may seem to see blood 
that is not pure “white”. ‘Mixed 
schools!” yells the Times-Dispatch in 
its frantic desire to keep these poor 
babies out of the best schools of the 
community. But some of the Indians 
object. It is a little hard to distin- 
guish between Negro and Indian blood, 
and these folks want the benefit of the 
doubt. But the Times-Dispatch 
gnashes its teeth and orders the Legis- 
lature to pass a law defining a colored 
person as one having “any ascertain- 
able amount of Negro blood.” But 
this surely is not enough. Does the 
Times-Dispatch want its sister to 
marry a man who has an unascertain- 
able amount of Negro blood? My 
God! What a loophole!

“INTER-MARRIAGE,” FINIS 


UR readers will remember that in 

the January, 1930, Crisis we 
published a letter from a young white 
man who sought advice on marrying a 
colored girl. We gave him our advice 
and asked our, readers to give him more. 
In the February and March numbers 
of THe Crisis our readers added to 
his burden of advice, thoughts and di- 
rections of all sorts. And now finally 
comes the end of the whole matter. He 
writes to us: 

“T have not read THe Crisis regu- 
larly for some time, so 1 was—it is 
rather difficult to say how I felt at first 
—embarrassed I think describes it best 
—when I looked into the February is- 
sue and discovered the discussion taking 
place over my case. I have been vari- 
ously amused and ruffled and pleased at 
the surmises as to what kind of folks 
we must be and the solutions offered. 
She is of a much more positive disposi- 
tion than I and, in my opinion, tired of 
my ‘to be or not to be’ state of mind 
these six or more years and recently 
married a fine young colored man.” 

And so they lived happily ever after! 


TAXICABS IN NEW YORK 


T is natural that most observers, even 

though they be colored, do not see 
the real animus of the taxicab fight in 
New York. In Chicago, the Yellow 
Taxicab Company has secured by vari- 
ous devices almost a monopoly of the 
taxicab business and no colored man 
can drive a Yellow Taxicab. In New 
York, on the other hand, where the 
monopoly has been broken, there are 
large numbers of Negro drivers earn- 
ing a decent living. There comes now 
continuous and energetic pressure to 
“improve” the taxicab service; to 
“drive out criminals”; to do anything 
which will put the taxicab business in- 
to the hands of a monopoly and give 
the monopoly large profits. Immedi- 
ately, the white drivers of this mon- 
opoly will organize a union and into 
that union no colored man may come. 
Gradually, colored drivers will be 
eliminated and several hundred men, 
who have earned a decent living, will 
be thrown into the ranks of the unem- 
ployed. They will sink to poverty and 


crime, and their delinquency will be 
credited to “the Negro race.” 


THE CAPITAL N. 
ECENTLY and with a certain 
suddenness, the periodical press of 
the United States has decided to capi- 
talize the word Negro. 

Much of the new resolve is due to 
Roscoe Conklin Bruce, who as editor 
of the bi-weekly sheet published by the 
Paul Laurence Dunbar Apartments, 
has recently carried on a vigorous cor- 
respondence, much like a similar effort 
made by Lester Walton some years 
ago. 

The N. A. A. C. P. also sent out 
over 700 letters with return postals to 
publishers all over the country. 

Mr. Bruce did not stress the logic 
of the situation so much as the cour- 
tesy. He said repeatedly to editors: 
the colored people of the United States 
desire to have the word Negro capital- 
ized, and their wishes ought to be re- 
spected. 

It was this argument that brought 
down the Atlantic Monthly and the 
New York Times. The Times says:“In 
our Style Book, Negro is now added 
to the list of words to be capitalized. 
It is not merely a typographical change, 
it is an act in recognition of racial 
self-respect for those who have been 
for generations in the ‘lower case’.” 

There remains scarcely a respectable 
periodical in the United States that 
refuses to capitalize Negro. In fact, 
the Government Printing Office in 
Washington and the Forum magazine 
stand almost alone. 


SOUTHERN REPUBLICANS 


E cannot refrain from having a 

quiet laugh at the expense of 
the President of the’ United States 
with regard to those Southern Repub- 
licans. The Senate Committee has rt 
galed us upon the venality of Southem 
politicians: they are taxing office: 
holders, selling offices, and pursuing 
the avocation of politics for all the 
traffic will bear. Moreover, it has 
been the silent assumption of all, and 
the blatant statement of papers like 
the Chicago Tribune, that all of this 
political rascality was the fault of Ne 
groes. And yet, despite this, the Sen-

ate Committee makes R. B. Creager, 
the white Republican National Com- 
mitteeman from Texas, target — for the 
Committee’s most scathing criticism”, 
and then, to cap this whole climax, 
Mr. Claudius H. Huston, Chairman 
of the Republican National Committee, 
Southern gentleman from Tennessee, 
appointed for the express purpose of 
cleansing these Augean stables for the 
benefit of Hoover nmajorities at the 
next presidential election, is suddenly 
discovered to have deposited some 
$36,000 which he received as lobby- 
ist, working for the sale of Muscles 
Shoales to private interests, to his own 
banking account in New York! Here, 
it was used to cover his gambling op- 
erations in Wall Street, and then, as 
he firmly asserts, it was “returned”. 
All of which convinces us of the spot- 
less purity of the white Republicans of 
the South and the unforgiveable per- 
verseness of Negroes in not following 
their able teachings and shining ex- 
ample. 


BACK TO THE FARM 


VERY once in a while there is a 

back-to-the-farm movement to in- 
duce Southern Negroes to leave the 
cities and go into the country. The ar- 
guments are that there is rich cheap 
land in the South; that the country is 
healthy; that the city is crowded and 
criminal; that the “natural” place for 
the Negro is on the soil. But Negroes 
do not respond, and unless they are 
natural born fools, they ought not to 
respond. 

Farming, the nation over, is in the 
grip of the industrial profiteers, sup- 
ported by an indefensible tariff system. 
Merchants and manufacturers are re- 
ceiving government subsidy by which 
they can beat down the price of the 
farmers’ raw material and raise the 
price of manufactured articles. The 
result is that the farming industry in 
the United States, as we have been 
repeatedly told, is sick unto death, and 
must be rescued. But remember that 
of the four million farms in the Unit- 
ed States, nearly one million are con- 
ducted by colored farmers. In other 
words, the colored farmers are a little 
less than a fourth of the farm popula- 
tion, and whatever applies to the dis- 
advantage of the farm population in 
general, falls with redoubled incidence 
on them. 

The Negro farmer is not only the 
victim of the general economic oppres- 
sion visited on all American farmers, 
but in addition to that, the country 
districts where he lives are nearest to 
slavery: there is no law and order; 
there is no decent education; there is 
no help toward social uplift. To ad- 


May, 1930 


vise a man to go into such an occu- 
pation and such a situation is to ad- 
vise him to commit suicide. 


MR. SADLER AND 
EDUCATION 


IR MICHAEL SADLER, an 

English educator, has been talking 
about democracy in education in the 
United States. He makes a very com- 
mon error. He says with perfect truth 
that there must be a trained élite in 
any group or nation to lead, to govern, 
to explore, to invent, to become scien- 
tists and artists. That this élite is and 
will ever be comparatively small in 
number, as compared with the mass of 
men. And then, he makes the old plea, 
for the special education of this élite, 
and decries the attempt to educate 
everybody as though they were a part 
of it. 

The mistake is subtle and from age 
to age few seem to see it. It consists 
in the assumption that the people who 
form the present élite are going to be 
the fathers and mothers of future mem- 
bers of this exclusive group, and that 
the only way to preserve civilization is 
to preserve the exclusive privileges and 
the closed circle of higher training of 
the present privileged classes. 


In fact, the truth is not here at all. 
The discovery of persons of talent and 
ability is a long and difficult process 
and most of the unusual ability of any 
modern country is submerged in the ig- 
norance and prejudice of the masses. 
Democracy and universal education do 
not mean that everybody can do every- 
thing or that all men should be edu- 
cated as though they were Sadlers. It 
does mean that there is a chance of dis- 
covering a Michael Sadler on the East 
Side and in Harlem, as well as in Park 
Lane and Tuxedo. And that the dis- 
covery calls for the widest opportunity 
for talent to express itself and show 
itself, no matter how poor and black 
and unlovely its parentage may be. And 
when it does show itself, no amount of 
injustice in the distribution of wealth 
or color prejudice or class discrimina- 
tion must stand in the way of a Har- 
vard education for the black and the 
poor, the Jew and the Italian, the 
Irishman or the Indian. 


The disheartening and _ invincible 
policy of modern educational methods 
is to ape England in limiting its high- 
er training mainly to the descendants 
of the privileged classes of last century. 





HAITI 
HE Report of the Hoover Com- 


mission to Haiti, while distinctly 
gratifying, is not clear. The Commis- 
sion recommends: 





1. That, on the inauguration of a 
duly elected permanent President of 
Haiti, the office of High Commissioner 
be abolished and that a United States 
Minister be appointed in his place as 
diplomatic representative. 

2. That there be a gradual with- 
drawal of Marines. 

3. That the United States shall 
thereafter intervene in Haitian affairs 
only in those cases where specific pro- 
vision is made by treaty between the 
two governments. 

4. That Haitians gradually replace 
United States officials, until by 1936, 
there will be a sufficient number of 
Haitian officials to take full charge of 
the government. 

5. That American physicians, en- 
gineers and police officials, shall be at 
the service of Haiti after the expira- 
tion of the treaty, in case Haiti desires 
them. 

6. That in retaining officers in the 
Haitian service or selecting new Amer- 
ican officials, the utmost care be taken 
that only those “free from strong ra- 
cial prejudice” be retained. 

7. That American Advisors be by 
treaty retained in the various depart- 
ments of the Haitian government to 
work under Haitian Cabinet Ministers. 

Thus, the Commission éxpects a 
temporary President, Eugene Roy, to 
take charge May 15, and in the fall of 
1930, a permanent President to assume 
office. From that time until 1936, there 
will be a gradual withdrawal of Amer- 
icans, and in 1936 Haiti is again to be- 
come a free country with of course pro- 
vision made that interest on a heavy 
debt be paid regularly to Wall Street, 
and probably some sort of “Platt 
Amendment” will be proposed. 


The judgment of the Commission 
on American intervention is naturally 
somewhat contradictory. There is the 
expected coat of whitewash, although 
it is very thin in places. The marines 
are praised. General Russell is found 
“whole-hearted and single-minded”’, 
and the Haitian Government is blamed 
for its condition in 1915. The Com- 
mission finds “great material progress 
in the past fifteen years,” and recites 
eight hundred miles of highways, a new 
and modern fiscal system, civil order, 
and a sanitary service. 


Nevertheless, the Commission frank- 
ly admits that the official heads acted as 
though they were in Haiti to stay; that 
there has. been no preparation of Hai- 
tians for political and administrative 
responsibilities. One of the extraordi- 
nary things is that the Commission 
finds that the Occupation made “a 
brusque attempt to build democracy.” 
It was indeed brusque! It meant the 
shooting down of over three thousand 
Haitians, and most of these the same 
poor peasants with whom we were sup- 


173 





posed to “try to broaden the basis of 
the articulate proletariat!” 


There is discreet silence on our 
work in education. 
In other words, the Report is 


muddled and not nearly as clear and 
straightforward as it ought to have 
been. Nevertheless, its specific recom- 
mendations are in the right direction. 
It is to the credit of Herbert Hoover 
that he has begun thus to retrieve the 
unforgivable error of Woodrow 
Wilson.

OUR PROGRAM 


HE National Association for the 

Advancement of Colored People 
stands for the full political, economic 
and social equality of white folk and 
Negroes. 

We have stood for this so long and 
fought for it so hard that it scarcely 
seems possible that anyone could mis- 
understand or successfully misrepre- 
sent our position. 

Our fight for political equality in- 
cludes a half-dozen cases taken up to 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States and our repeated urging of in- 
dependent voting. 

Our fight for economic equality has 
directed our attack upon discriminat- 
ing unions and unfair employers and 
our advocating of co-operation and so- 
cialization of wealth. 

Our fight for social equality has 
meant a long struggle against residen- 
tial segregation and anti inter-marriage 
bills. 

Beyond this, however, we recognize 
there are other and greater fields to 
conquer: there is the question of poli- 
tical rights for women, for the poor, 
for the unrepresented laboring millions 
throughout the world; there is the 
problem of economic justice in the dis- 
tribution of income and in the democ- 
ratization of the whole industrial 
process; and there is the question of 
caste and social class based on wealth 
and privilege. There is above all the 
question of Peace and the cessation of 
imperial aggression on weaker peoples. 

To this greater field the N. A. A. 
C. P. has given thought and attention. 
But its contention is that until the 
radical thought of the world recog- 
nizes the role of color discrimination, 
it can never properly gird itself to 
fight for political, economic and social 
rights for the majority of men. 

In other words, the color line today 
in hindering Democracy; is stopping 
economic justice; and is making real 
human contact impossible. It is doing 
this not simply by depriving colored 
folk of these advantages, but by the 
fact that through this color discrim- 
ination, the majority of white folk are 


174 


also kept from democracy in politics, 
industry and society. 

It is this point that radicals con- 
tinually forget. Not understanding 
the Negro problem, they assume that 
political rights for white folk mean 
political rights for black folk; that 
after obtaining industrial justice, white 
working men will extend this to col- 
ored workingmen; that social insult 
and ostracism practiced against Ne- 
groes is nothing more than white class 
feeling based on wealth. 

The N. A. A. C. P. has warned its 
radical friends and warns them now 
again: there is no magic in a radical 
program which is going to make the 
mass of people, rich and poor, forget 
their inborn prejudice against other 
races, especially if the races are darker 
hued. 

It is, therefore, the first job of the 
N. A. A. C, P. and of any colored or- 
ganization to get rid of this color com- 
plex; to fight color discrimination as 
such; to admit frankly that this is not 
the whole of the battle for human 
rights, but it is the first rampart to be 
taken; that until this battle is fought 
and won, there can be no racial politi- 
cal democracy in the world; there can 
be no complete economic justice; there 
can be no social equality. There can 
be no permanent Peace on Earth. 


AN ARCHITECTURAL LIE 


The following notice was printed in 
Architecture, January 1, 1930; the 


italics are ours: 


Two Fontainebleau scholarships of 
$500 each, offered by Mr. Whitney War- 
ren, will be awarded, by the jury selected 
for the judgment, for the two best des- 
signs submitted for the Class A IV 
Project in the school year 1929-1930, of 
the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, De- 
partment of Architecture. 

To be eligible for the scholarships the 
students must be registered in Class A 
and must be American citizens of the 
white race, a condition that is fixed by 
the regulations of the French government 
for the Fontainebleau school. The regu- 
lations in the circular of information gov- 
erning Class A competitions will apply, 
except that the scholarships will not be 
awarded to any student who has pre- 
viously won any other architectural 
scholarship for foreign travel or study or 
to any member of a school faculty. 


Tue Crisis immediately wrote 
Gratien Candace, deputy in the 
French Parliament, and H. O. Tanner 
the well-known painter. We print two 
replies to M. Candace and Mr. Tan- 
ner’s answer to us. 


Paris, February 27, 1930. 
From the Ministry of Public Instruc- 
tion and of Fine Arts. 
You have asked me to let you know 
if the rules of the American Schools 


of Art at Fontainebleau contain any 
special provisions concerning colored 
students. 

I have the honor to inform you that 
the rules approved in 1927 by the Min. 
istry of the Interior, upon advice from 
my office, do not contain any regula. 
tions of that kind. I may add that | 
have brought your question directly to 
the attention of the President of the 
Council of Administration of the 
Schools. 

The Director General of Fine Arts 

Member of the Institute. 

Paut Leon. 


Paris, March 13, 1930, 
From the Ministry of Public Instruc- 
tion and Fine Arts. 

You have asked me if the rules of the 
American Schools of Art at Fontaine. 
bleau contain any special provision on 
the subject of colored students. Fol- 
lowing my letter of February 27, | 
have the honor to inform you that | 
am in possession of an answer from the 
President of the Council of Adminis- 
tration and that he finds no provisions 
on that subject in the statutes nor in 
the school rules. 

The Under Secretary of State 
for Fine Arts. 
EuGENE LAUuTIER. 

The very day I received yours of 
January 28th—through friends I went 
at once and saw an officer of the Gov- 
ernment. He said—‘‘You can be sure 
there is no truth in such a statement.” 
The Government receives all, be they 
white or black or yellow or green or 
what not with equal pleasure. He 
went on to say how many black citi- 
zens France had, and that such a state- 
ment was not at all in line with their 
policy or thought on the matter. 

Henry O. TANNER. 


On receipt of these letters, THE 
Crisis wrote the editor of Architecture 
and received the following reply: 


The announcement regarding the Fon- 
tainebleau Scholarships was printed in 
Architecture from a typed announcement 
sent to us by The Beaux-Arts Institute 
of Design, 304 East 44th Street, New 
York City. 

The announcements of this kind are 
published just as we receive them from 
various organizations working with the 
architectural profession. Personally, I 
had not noticed the restriction you men- 
tion, and have never heard of it before. 
I would suggest that you get in touch 
with the Director of The Beaux-Arts 
Institute of Design in regard to the 
matter. 

(Signed) H. H. SAytor 

Immediately, letters were sent, 
March 31, to the Director of the 
Beaux-Arts Institute and to Mr. 
Whitney Warren. No replies or even 
acknowledgments have been received 
from either.

fire and sang through that long night 
on Monadnock. Children ran to him 
instinctively, as they did to Charles 
Sumner. They knew somehow that 
he was friendly. His very horses 
knew it, in his riding and driving 
days. For one or two summers I had 
his old guides on a salmon river in 
Cape Breton. They had not seen him 
for many years, but they adored him, 
and there are no better judges of a 
man. Whether you saw him at play 
or at work,—at the farm in Lincoln, 
the summer home on Cranberry Isl- 
and, in his library on the Fenway,— 
whether you talked about his favorite 
reading in history, biography and the 
older fiction and poetry, or simply the 
endless social gossip of earlier Boston 
days, you were in the presence of a 
friendly soul. And his friendliness 
was never more radiant than when one 
happened to touch upon those deeper 
questions of human rights and duties 
which were never long absent from 
his mind. I shall never forget, though 
it was twenty-five years ago, how his 
face glowed one night when I chanced 
to quote a sentence from a brilliant 
Irish lawyer, Lord Russell; I not 
knowing then that Russell was his dear 
friend and that the sentence was one 
of his own favorite quotations. I ven- 
ture to repeat it now, because it ex- 
presses the dominant passion of Moor- 
field Storey’s life. It is a definition 
of civilization: ‘Its true signs are 
thought for the poor and suffering, 
chivalrous regard and respect for wo- 
man, the frank recognition of human 
brotherhood, irrespective of race or 
color or nation or religion, the nar- 
rowing of the domain of mere force 
as a governing factor in the world, the 
Jeve of ordered freedom, abhorrence 
of what is mean and cruel and vile, 
ceaseless devotion to the claims of jus- 
tice.”

Officer ordered the Commissioner of 
Police to take action. Three white

Crisis, there was a similar attempt to 
lay a head tax on women and a similar 
protest on account of the communeal

the women did not have a right to

counter-charges as to what occurred, 
The English say that it was some of 
the chiefs who illegally tried to lay 
tax and keep the proceeds. At any 
rate there was misunderstanding and 
in the end, 10,000 natives destroyed 
$50,000 worth of property, raided the 
government offices and prisons, and 
drove out nearly all the whites. Troops 
were brought in with machine guns 
and killed twenty-nine women and one

LLOW me to thank you for print- 

ing the facts about Rabindranath 
Tagore’s treatment on the Pacific 
Coast. I had an intimation of this 
from something I saw, but it was very 
unsatisfactory and incomplete. The 
facts, I think, ought to be more general- 
ly known. If they had treated a coal 
heaver this way no harm would have 
been done, for a coal heaver is accus- 
tomed to that kind of treatment; but 
to treat as wonderful a soul as Tagore 
was treated in San Francisco shows a 
lack of manners, for which our entire 
government should be ashamed . 

Dr. Tagore’s message is a wonderful 
one and I hope that you will find oc- 
casion to insert it, as well as that of 
Mahatma Gandhi, in frequent num- 
bers of THE CRIsIs. 

Bolton Smith, Memphis, Tenn. 


I have not the time to write you as 
I would write on several matters which 
my now belated reading of the July 
Crisis impress upon me; but I now 
express to you my thought that your 
“Government by Graft” is one of the 
most effective brief statements of the 
case which I have read. 

I always find your opening summary 
unique in its power as well as grasp of 
situations. It makes me mourn again 
and again, as I said to you in my house 
. here ten years ago, that you did not 
use qualities so notable for constructive 
pulling together rather than for the dis- 
integrating criticisms you write over 
and again of Hampton and Tuskegee. 








Round Table Talks—Twentieth Year Program 


In November, 1910, the CRISIS began. 
we start the 20th year which we hope to finish with a 
larger circulation and a bigger and better magazine. This 
will be possible only through the co-operation of writers, 
advertisers, agents, subscribers and buyers of single copies. 


The recent incident of Mr. Abbott’s 
London hotel experiences makes it clear 
that the richness of the artistic endow- 
ments of the African can not be driven 
into the minds or hearts of the absurd- 
ly egotistic Nordics, but must be car- 
ried into the consciousness of minds 
opened by the practice of the extraordi- 
nary qualities of Patience and Gentle- 
ness which the greatest of the Prophets 
has shown to be more powerful than 
any Marxian types of antagonists. 


The Verse page is fine, I think. And 
in fact, the whole July number has 
too much richness of material to allow 
one to be merely passive in regretful 
thought that so many minds are kept 
from even reading one of the most bril- 
liant of current periodicals. 


George Foster Peabody, Saratoga. 


Permit me to congratulate you upon 
the distinctive improvement in THE 
Crisis. It is the one magazine for 
which I “crave” each month, and im- 
mediately upon its receipt, I read it in 
its entirety. 


G. D. Brantley, Missouri. 


1 want to compliment the mechanics, 
art work, etc., in reproducing Mrs. De 
Priest’s picture in a recent issue of THE 
Crisis. It was particularly fine—that 
was the general comment. 


Morris Lewis, Secretary 
to Congressman DePriest.

Each month I look forward to and 
read THE Crisis with a great deal of 
pleasure. But being a mere woman 
there is an article in the November is- 
sue that appeals to me particularly. 

I refer to “I am not Invited”. I 
think every woman should read and 
profit by it and.so I am going to repro- 
duce it—of course, giving credit to 
Tue Crists—on the Woman’s Page 
of the It is a whole 
sermon to women in a brief article. 


Allow me to thank you for “The 
Stroud Family” in July, and for “Clif- 
ford Blount” in August. This is the 
kind of stuff that I have longed to see 
in THe Crisis. Cannot tell you how 
these articles pepped me up, and there 
are many others who were helped 
thereby, I am sure. 


Sam B. Wallace, South Carolina. 


Just a line to express my apprecia- 
tion, as a reader of your valuable maga- 
zines, of the very great service THE 
Crisis is doing for our people along 
all lines. Just now I am attracted by 
your comprehensive reply to the young 
man who has chosen Journalism as a 
profession. 

Sam Williams, Massachusetts. 


Please note my new address as given

joys reading your magazine.
