UICKER than a flash, at times, joy is 
turned into sorrow. It is also at 
such times that the lack of insurance pro- 
tection proves most embarrassing to the 
injured person or the bereaved family. 


The following testimonial gives the 
bright side to one of these dark pictures. 
It shows conclusively that insurance is 
the silver lining when the dark clouds of 
disaster drop upon us.

Gentiemen: 

I am taking this opportunity to express my thanks for the prompt 
payment of the death claim of my daughter, Catherine Saunders, who, along 
with two other persons, was killed in an automobile accident March 2, 1929 
at Plainfield, New Jersey. Her death was a serious blow to me, but I was 


certainly relieved of much worry by the prompt manner in which you settled 
her claim. 


I am wishing you a wonderful success in New Jersey, like you have 
had in Old Virginia. 
Thanking you again, I am, 
Gratefully yours, 
(signed) Sallie Saunders 


The above testimonial illustrates only one part of the trinity of insurance pro- 
tection which One Small Premium provides when placed with the Southern Aid 
Society of Va., Inc. That one premium entitles the insured to Weekly Benefits dur- 
ing periods of Sickness or Accident, as well as a Death Benefit to his beneficiary.

HEN this Company began business, in 1898, one 

small room housed all its activities. Today, the 

branch offices of the National Benefit are spread 
over twenty-eight states; its Home Office at Washington 
occupies an entire office building; its agents cover half the 
Nation. 





















In 1898, the Company’s insurance in force amounted to a 
few thousand dollars. Today, it is verging on eighty millions. 
The original six dollars of cash assets have grown to more 
than six millions. The handful of policyholders of that early 
: day has become an army over three hundred thousand strong.

The one-room enterprise of thirty-one years ago is now the 
greatest Negro business institution in the world. 












This amazing growth has not come about by accident. There 

| is no magic about it. It is based, principally, upon giving 
you the policy of insurance that is best fitted to your needs, 
at fair and equitable rates. !

THE Crisis

Volume 36, No. 8 





HE United States is worried over 

Venezuela. We do so need another 
little country to pacify, and the Vene- 
zuela revolution is not coming on as 
fast as it should.—At Mrs. Hoover’s 
little colored tea-party, Texas hides its 
head in shame and New Jersey is 
proud.—Bishop Cannon dislikes liquor 
and Niggers, but is not adverse to a 
little gambling on the side.—And here 
come the black boxers again, in spite 
_of the gravest efforts of Dempsey and 
others to run away. It is terribly 
hard to keep this sport clean and 
Nordic.—Professor MacIntosh of Yale 
University will not be allowed to be- 
come an American citizen because he 
does not like to kill people without 
being morally satisfied that he ought 
to.—It looks as though the soldiers who 
are still fighting Germans on German 
territory might twelve years after the 
peace of Versailles be withdrawn. It is 
so much easier to start war than to end 
it—More persons followed General 
Booth to his grave than followed the 
Duke of Wellington to his.—Mr. 
Dawes before he went to conquer Eng- 
land found that Santa Domingo owes 
us $20,000,000, and that most of her 


income must go to pay interest on this

loan her more.—We are persecuting 
two terrible women, Mrs. Dennett 
and Margaret Sanger because we 
do not want children to know any- 
thing about sex, or mothers to 
have any choice in their arrival. 
Meantime, Texas Guinan flourishes. 
—And now the new Labor Gov- 
ernment in England is threatening 
to recognize Russia, which is a direct 
slap at the United States.—Again the 
collapse of Russia has been indefinitely 
postponed.—Peace and love between 
the Catholic hierarchy and the Musso- 
lini tyranny are being cemented by 
printed recriminations on education 
between the contestants.—Civil war 
in China is not coming on as fast as 
the West had hoped.—The South Af- 
rican elections were as indecisive as our 
election of 1928.—The Council of the 
League of Nations met in Spain and 
did a little less than nothing. The 
world cries Peace for armies and War 
for income, which is a contradiction in

to give up $100,000 a year for a 
measly $12,000. How can any real 
patriotic American live on $12,000 a 
year ?>—More money is being loaned to 
gamble in Wall Street than the whole 
country was worth before the World 
War. Gambling will soon be the great- 
est industry in England and America.— 
$100,000,000 have been refunded to 
millionaire men and corporations on 
the taxes which they paid. It looks now 
as though the Keith theatres, the Otis 
Elevator Company, the American Tele- 
phone and Telegraph Company, the 
New York Life Insurance Company, 
the United Fruit Company and a few 
other paupers might be able to live 
through the winter.—The South is 
fighting white union labor. White 
union labor disfranchised black labor. 
When white labor and black labor 
cease being stupid and resentful, the 
Solid South will crumble.—Soviet 
propaganda in England and America 
must cease. Capitalist propaganda in 
Russia, Europe, America, Asia, Africa, 
Hell and Heaven still goes merrily 
on.—What? Strikes in North Caro- 
lina, Tennessee and Louisiana? And 
among white laborers?

THE CrRrisIs 















HIS year it is easier than usual to 

survey the condition and prospects 
of Negro colleges because of the Re- 
port of the United States Bureau of 
Education. In 1917, the Bureau is- 
sued a Report done by Thomas Jesse 
Jones. It was incomplete and unfair 
and marked by a prejudice against 
Negro colleges. The Report of 1928 
was done in conjunction with the De- 
partments of Education of nineteen 
states, with the co-operation of 79 Ne- 
gro colleges, and also of the Associa- 
tions of Colleges for Negro Youth, the 
Phelps-Stokes Fund, and various edu- 
cational boards and foundations. ‘The 
resulting Report is distinctly favorable 
to real Negro education. 

The introduction says: “The record 
of achievement of the Negro during the 
past fifty years has been unparalleled.” 
And to this achievement “No single 
factor has contributed more than educa- 
tion.” 

The Report goes on to say: “The im- 
mediate need is more education, bet- 
ter education, and higher education.” 

There are 79 Negro universities and 
colleges studied in this survey, includ- 
ing 22 publicly supported institutions 
under state ownership and control, 9 
universities and colleges privately sup- 
ported by independent boards, 31 uni- 
versities and colleges supported by 
white dominational churches boards, 
and 17 colleges privately supported by 
Negro church organizations. 

The state colleges have an annual in- 
come of $3,201,575, or an average of 
$145,526. The private colleges have 
an annual income of $2,349,739, or an 
average of $261,082. The Negro 
church schools, excluding one which 
did not report, a total annual income of 
$1,761,636, or an average of $66,977. 
The colleges controlled by white 
church boards have an annual income 
of $1,893,333, or an average of 
$61,075. The 9 independent institu- 
tions represent a capital investment of 
$8,329,507, and total productive en- 
dowment funds of $16,394,328. The 
22 state institutions are supported by 
appropriations amounting to $3,201,- 
575, of which $1,909,161 are state ap- 
propriations and $259,120 are Federal 
appropriations, The students pay 
$438,035. The physical plants of these 
institutions are valued at $10,443,746. 

The 17 Negro church institutions 
have an annual income of $1,071,636, 
which comes chiefly from church ap- 
propriations $395,347; state appropri-

A Government Survey of Negro 


Colleges 


This is a brief summary of the 
“Survey of Negro Colleges and 
Universities”, made by the United 
States Department of the Interior. 


It is known as Bureau of Educa- 
tion Bulletin (1928)—No. 7. It 
consists of 964 pages and costs 


only $1.50. 





ations, $280,160; student fees, $272,- 
589. The state appropriations are 
chiefly for subsidizing teacher-training 
work. The capital investment of these 
schools amount to $6,369,174. They 
have small endowment, $183,748. 

The 11 schools of Methodist church 
boards have a total income which 
amounts to $527,795, of which $210,- 
509 comes from church appropriations, 
and $187,487 from student fees. The 
capital investment represents $4,403,- 
014. The productive endowment is 
$541,860. 

The 6 Northern Baptist church 
schools have a total income of $465,- 
897, of which $108,426 comes from 
students, and $71,440 from churches. 
Their equipment is worth $3,265,290. 
Their endowments amount to $1,226,- 
959. Under the American Missionary 
Society, there are 6 colleges; their an- 


nual income is $408,969, of which 


$216,653 comes from churches and 


$99,770 from student fees. The equip- 
ment is worth $2,867,538, and the en- 
dowments amount to $311,212. 

The Presbyterian Church has two 
colleges: 

Their annual revenues amount to 
$174,260, which will be increased 
when Barber College commences to re- 
ceive the yield on its endowment. The 
two institutions have a value of $1,- 
129,000. The endowment of these 
colleges amounts to over $2,000,000. 
The United Presbyterian Church sup- 
ports Knoxville College, which will 
soon have its own Board of Trustees 
and an endowment of $500,000. Its 
annual income is $68,600, and _ its 
property is worth $513,000. 

There are five other colleges sup- 
ported by Northern white churches. 


HE summary of the Report says: 

“The progress made in the de- 
velopment of Negro higher educational 
institutions in the United States dur- 
ing the last decade has been astonish- 
ing in its scope and almost incredible 
in its magnitude.” 


PROPERTY 


“Ten years ago the annual income of 
the universities and colleges included in 
this survey totaled $2,283,000. For 
1926-27, the annual income amounted 
to $8,560,000, an increase of 275 per 
cent. The financial support being ac- 
corded Negro higher education is near- 
ly four times what it was in 1917. 


“Total capital investment in the real 
properties of the institutions has also 
increased at a precipitate rate. The 
value of the physical plants of these 
institutions 10 years ago was fixed at 
$15,720,000. Their present value is 
$38,680,000, representing a gain of 146 
per cent, due principally to the con- 
struction of modern school buildings 
and other improvements in the-plants. 

“The most important advance made 
by the institutions, however, has been 
the large increase in their productive 
endowments, indicating the existence 
of a growing conviction that Negro 
higher education must be placed on a 
permanent basis through the provision 
of stable annual income. In 1917, the 
productive endowments of the univer- 
sities and colleges making up this sur- 
vey amounted to $7,225,000 with an 
annual yield of $361,250. Since then, 
additions have brought this total up to 
$20,713,000, the annual yield being 
$1,071,300. The gain over the period 
of 10 years in both endowment and an- 
nual yield, therefore, has been approxi- 
mately 185 per cent.”

STUDENTS IN COLLEGE 


It is estimated that in the United 
States for every ten thousand whites, 
90 white students are attending col- 
lege, and for every 10,000 Negroes, 15 
students are attending college.” 

In Mississippi, provision for higher 
education of the Negro is inadequate 
and in serious need of expansion . 

In Oklahoma, it has been “devel- 
oped only to an average extent.” 

North Carolina is making rapid 
strides in Negro higher education. 


There are 12 colleges and normal 
schools. 


261 


In South Carolina, “need exists for 
stimulus of Negro higher education.” 

Tennessee ranks high in Negro high- 
er education. 

Texas has made great progress in 
Negro higher education. 

The higher education of Negroes in 
Louisiana is below the average. 

In Virginia, Negro higher education 
is fairly served. 

The District of Columbia stands 
first in the higher education of Ne- 
groes due to the presence of Howard 
University. 

Negro higher institutions of learn- 
ing in Georgia are not well distributed 
throughout the state. 

Higher education in Florida is de- 
veloping slowly.

TEACHING 

“Altogether, there are 40 institutions 
with full-time college faculties of 8 or 
more teachers, 17 institutions with 
faculties numbering from 5 to 7 full- 
time college teachers, and 22 institu- 
tions with faculties of less than 5 full- 
time college teachers.” 

The Survey Committee was favor- 
ably impressed with the excellent prepa- 
ration of teachers. 

“On repeated occasions teaching of 
outstanding quality was observed in 
college classes in literature, modern 
language, mathematics, science, and in 
many other subjects. Notwithstanding 
notable defects in the teaching at cer- 
tain institutions, there is every reason 
to believe that proper encouragement 
and more adequate financial support 
will serve to develop the quality of 
teaching in Negro higher educational 
institutions to a high standard.” 

In nearly all the colleges, some 
teachers carry excessive loads, and the 
average teacher is getting a minimum 
compensation. 

“The average salary paid the upper 
third of teachers in all the institutions 
is $2,263 annually. The average sal- 
ary of the lower third is only $863.” 


EQUIPMENT 


A study of the libraries of the 79 col- 
leges included in the survey reveals 


262 


For Every 10,000 
ee Inhabitants 
n 


one of the most serious present deficien- 
cies. Of the 79 institutions, only 15 
have libraries of 10,000 or more vol- 
umes. While laboratories are begin- 
ning to be equipped, very few institu- 
tions have yet made the necessary 
preparation for teaching biology, chem- 
istry and physics. Biology is the worst 


off. The colleges have done outstand- 
ing service in their contribution into 
musical art. Nevertheless, many schools 
are handicapped by poor instruments. 


ENROLLMENT 


In the 79 schools, the total enroll- 
ment of college students in 1922-23 
was 6,684. In 1926-27, it was in- 
creased to 13,860. 

All the colleges, except seven receive 
both men and women students. Four 
receive only men, and three only wo- 
men. In 1926-27, of 12,090 students, 
6,146 were men and 5,944 were wo- 
men. 


ADVICE TO NEGRO 
COLLEGES 


HE estimates and criticisms passed 
on the work of certain colored 
colleges are worth quoting in part: 

Alcorn is “not up to the standard” 
set by other Negro Colleges. 

Jackson is inadequately supported 
and in a serious crisis. 

Tougaloo does not 
standards. 

Langston has undergone many vicis- 
situdes but is now developing rapidly 
in the right direction. 

Durham is in a position to be of 
greater service to the community than 
it has been in the past. 

Shaw needs a larger income. 

Livingston and Johnson C. Smith 
should concentrate on College work. 

Benedict needs higher standards in 
all its branches. 

Allen has too few graduates to war- 
rant a college department. 

Morris should cut off its college de- 
partment and Claflin should cut off its 
high school. 

Fisk should add graduate work. 

The Tennessee State Normal has 
a fine physical plant and should em- 
phasize its work as a teachers’ college. 

Knoxville should abolish its require- 
ments in ancient languages. 

Prairie View has good plant but 
loses too many students and its course 
of study needs revision. 

Wiley should discontinue its high 
school. 

Morehouse College should employ 
fewer ministers and fewer graduates of 
Morehouse. 

Spelman College has too small an en- 
rollment for its plant. 

Morris Brown University is a criti- 
cal state for lack of funds. 


meet modern 


Bishop should sell its valuable site 
and move to the country. 

Samuel Houston is handicapped by a 
deficit each year. 

Xavier should be moved to the coun- 
try and have space and modern build- 
ings. 

Southern University needs reorgaui- 
zation of its course of study. 

At Hampton “steps should be taken 
at once toward strengthening, enlarg- 
ing and liberalizing the college pro- 
gram and toward cultivating a tone of 
administration and of institutional re- 
lationship in harmony with the self- 
respect and personal responsibility of a 
collegiate student body.” 

Virginia Union University needs ade- 
quate endowment and should get rid 
of excessive requirements in languages 
and the Bible. 

Tuskegee is developing from an in- 
dustrial school to a teachers’ training 
school. ‘The development has raised 
a serious lack of classification of the 
courses offered in the different divi- 
sions. Levels of training and specific 
objectives are being generally ignored.” 
Revision and re-classification of the aca- 
demic program is recommended. The 
college should include mathematics, his- 
tory, economics, English and foreign 
languages, and should be separated 
from the high school. 

Philander Smith has a wholly inade- 
quate plant. 

Shorter College must either get more 
support or go out of existence. 

The Arkansas A. N. & M. College 
is unsightly and run-down but is being 
reorganized. 

Howard University needs permanent 
endowment and a school of graduate 
studies. It should have shops and 
laboratories, a college of applied sci- 
ence and a new administration building 
with space for a faculty club. Mor- 
tality of the student body should be 
looked into. 

Clark University has a tendency to 
extend its curriculum in too many di- 
rections. 

Florida A. & M. College falls below 
standards and should not give degrees 
for industrial work. 

Edward Waters College is attempt- 
ing a program too diversified and too 
scattered. 

Simmons College must either get 
money or be discontinued. 

Lincoln Institute, Ky., is a high 
school with only five college students. 
It should develop into a college. 

West Virginia State College should 
discontinue its high school. 

Wilberforce with increased appro- 
priations has fewer students. It has 
failed to revise its educational pro- 
gram and there is lack of coordination

THe Crisis 





The Year of Education, 1929 


enquéte, THE CRISIS estimates 
that there weer in American colleges 
in the year 1928-29, 19,253 students of 
Negro descent, of whom 2,160 received 
degrees. On account of the large num- 
ber of graduates, we have been unable 
this year to give the names except in 
the case of those who have made dis- 
tinguished records. A detailed report 
follows: 
The total enrollment in Negro col- 
leges according to the Bureau of Edu- 
cation Bulletin has been as follows: 


1922-23 6,684 
1923-24 7,782 
1924-25 9,506 
1925-26 11,698 
1926-27 13,860 
Crisis estimate, 1928-29. 16,982 


Professional Graduates 


In addition to the graduates of pro- 
fessional schools already noted, Me- 
harry Medical College had the follow- 
ing graduates: 

Enrollment: Medicine 214, Dentis- 
try 86, Pharmacv 63. 

Graduates: Medicine 48, Dentistry 
21, Pharmacy 16. 

Ranking Students: Medicine, L. J. 
Hicks; Dentistry, J. H. Bell; Phar- 
macy, W. A. Davis. 

Howard University had the follow- 
ing professional graduates: 

LL.B., 27; M.D., 44; D.D.S., 19; 
Graduates in Pharmacy, 12; Master 
of Arts, 5. 

Ranking Scholar in the Law School, 
Reginald O. Jackson. 

Ranking Scholar in Medicine, Graf- 
ton R. Brown. 

Ranking Scholar in Dentistry, Stan- 
ton H. Craig. 

Gammon Theological School has 88 
students in its Seminary and 24 in the 
School of Missions. It bestowed the 
degree of B.D. on eleven students and 
gave two honorary degrees. 


O N the strength of a nation-wide 


Total Enrollnrent 


If we leave out Liberia and add the 
college students at Negro colleges and 
Junior colleges not listed above, and 
professional students at Howard and 
Meharry, we have a total of 16,982, 
with 1,591 reported graduates with de- 
grees, 1929; and, it is estimated, 175 
unreported, making a total of 1,766. 


DISTINCTIONS 


ANY distinctions have been won 
by Negro students in northern 
institutions. 

At Bryn Mawr, Miss Cook, a un- 
dergraduate, has been awarded the 
James E. Rhodes Junior Scholarship 
of $400 for 1930-31.

Crisis 


Message to the American People 


HE N. A. A. C. P. has for twenty 

years worked to solve the most 
dificult social problem that faces 
America. When it was founded in 
1909, Negroes were being lynched at 
the rate of 78 a year; the Supreme 
Court had never passed on the 15th 
Amendment. ‘Tillman and Vardaman 
were the chief authorities on the race 
problem. Few reputable scientists 
dared to assert the equality of the races. 
We had only 1,100 Negro college stu- 
dents. Physicians and sociologists pre- 
dicted the inevitable extinction of 
American Negroes, and Negroes them- 
selves did not believe that an organi- 
zation like this could exist or function. 


The Negro problem is still with us 
after 20 years’ struggle. But it is not 
the same problem. We still lynch and 
burn at the stake, but now it’s 11 a 
year instead of 78. A series of court 
decisions has laid the foundation of our 
real citizenship as voters, householders, 
travellers and workers. No reputable 
scientist or public speaker today de- 
nies the essential equality of all races; 
the physical survival of the Negro is 
unquestioned, we have 19,253 col- 
lege students and our organization in- 
cluding THe Crisis has received and 
expended $1,567,330 since 1909. 

The N. A. A. C. P. did not alone 
and unaided bring all these results, but 
it was the initial and moving force, and 
it has proven three things: that white 
and black Americans can work efficient- 
ly together for human uplift; that 
America will furnish funds to fight 
race prejudice when it realizes that it 
is not instinctive but a deliberately 
fashioned weapon of hurt and gain; and 
thirdly and chiefly, that earnest hu- 
man beings can strive for a radical and 
even revolutionary ideal without blood- 
shed and without hate. 

We have still a tremendous fight be- 
fore us: we face today not simply a 
provincial and national problem of race 
and color, but one that belts the world 
and threatens its progress. We stand 
here in the greatest republic of the 
world on fatal and strategic ground: 
if we prove that the most diverse races 
can live together here in equality, dem- 
ocracy and self-respect, we can lead the 
world to Peace, Democracy in Industry 
and Freedom in Art. If we fail, we 
turn back toward War, Poverty and 
Slavery. 

During the past year we have suf- 
fered one grievous set-back: after our 
long and hitherto repeatedly successful 
fight against segregation, the Supreme 
Court has recently refused a second 
time to pass on the legality of private 


August, 1929 


The 20th Annual Meeting of 
the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People 
was held in Cleveland, Ohio, June 
26 to July 2, 1929. The following 
address to the country was adopt- 


ed. 


compacts to establish segregated dis- 
tricts, notwithstanding the fact that the 
court has denied this right to public 
law-making bodies. Against this hide- 
ous injustice, we shall find ways still 
to fight on. 

On the other hand, our fight against 
Negro disfranchisement proceeds suc- 
cessfully: last year we established by 
United States Supreme Court decision 
the illegality of state laws disfranchis- 
ing Negroes in primary elections; 
this year we have in Virginia a Federal 
District Court decision against the 
legality of such disfranchisement by 
party leaders. We have actually suc- 
ceeded with the help of Congressman 
Tinkham of Massachusetts in inducing 
the House of Representatives to vote 
for the reduction of Southern repre- 
sentation according to the 14th Amend- 
ment, and while the party whip re- 
versed this decision next day, the vote 
threw the fear of God for a day into 
Blease, Carraway and 40 or 50 illegally 
elected Southern representatives; and 
the end is not yet. 

We welcome President Hoover’s de- 
cision to clean up Southern politics and 
to investigate law enforcement, and we 
only hope that common honesty and 
logical consistency will not stop reform 
short of a full exposure of the rotten 
borough methods of the South, the sys- 
tematic and illegal disfranchisement, 
lynching, segregation, injustice toward 
Negroes in the courts, and barbarous 
punishment and convict lease systems. 

Especially is the crying shame of de- 
nial of common school training to Ne- 
gro children a matter calling for in- 
vestigation and remedy. A just share 
of educational funds of the United 
States government, of Land-Grant 
funds, of the Smith-Hughes and the 
Smith-Lever appropriations, and of 
other moneys, is regularly and delib- 
erately stolen from Negro children 
with the knowledge and connivance of 
United States and State officials, and 
the discrimination in state educational 
appropriations, especially in South 
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi 
and Alabama is notorious and often 
amounts to spending $16.00 for a white 
child and only $1.00 a year for a black 
child. 


We still suffer the insult of the 
“Jim Crow” car, the discrimination of 
bus lines and steamships and in places 
of public instruction, accommodation 
and amusement, even when these are 
supported by public charter and taxa- 
tion. 

We still face the discrimination and 
exclusion of trade unions, and we here- 
by repeat our invitation and warning 
of 1924 to the American Federation 
of Labor: 

“Is it not time that black and white 
labor get together? Is it not time for 
white unions to stop bluffing and for 
black laborers to stop cutting off their 
noses to spite their faces? 

“We propose that there be formed 
by the National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People, the 
American Federation of Labor, the 
Railway Brotherhoods and any other 
bodies agreed upon, an _ Inter-racial 
Labor Commission.” 

The present condition of colored 
labor is precarious; with all its ad- 
vance in efficiency and variety of em- 
ployment, it is meeting severe com- 
petition, especially 1.. he South, and 
the traditional “Negro job” is disap- 
pearing. This hurts the Negro, but 
it reacts on the white for the Negro in 
retaliation must and will “scab” and 
underbid. Immediate action is called 
for. 

And beyond this, in Africa and the 

colonies and the West Indies, the aboli- 
tion of forced labor, the restoration of 
the land and political and industrial 
democracy and the restoring of au- 
tonomy to Haiti is not only a crying 
need for colored folk, but the key to the 
emancipation of white labor through- 
out the world. 
,We repeat today as before: the 
American Negroes’ great weapon of 
offense is the ballot. We should vote. 
We should seek aHianee with the 
forces which stand for honest govern- 
ment, the abolition of privilege, and the 
socialization of wealth; buf whenever 
these liberals deny us fellowship and 
draw the color line, we are justified in 
making any political alliance which de- 
fends us from political annihilation, 
economic discrimination and social in- 
sult. 

Finally, as just ‘stewards, give us 
funds to fight. Provide cash for de- 
fense, adequate salaries and current ex- 
pense. Support our organ THE 
Crisis; and let us go forward to a new 
decade of unity and success.

“Arma Virumque Cano!” 
By CLIFFORD BLOUNT 


WAS graduat- 

from Wiley 
College in 
March. I have 
been attending 
this school for 
ten years — ever 
since being in the 
grades. And dur- 
ing every one of 
those ten years I 
have been with- 
out the service of 
two of the of the 
most valuable 
members of the 

body—the arms. 

I was born on a farm out from Jef- 
ferson, Texas, December 11, 1902— 
the fifth child of a family of seven 
children. I was only able to live ele- 
ven years in perfect normalcy, for at 
the age of eleven, a wagon rolled over 
my abdomen causing internal injuries 
which affected me for over five years— 
the mere beginning of my “accident 
complex”. When I began to recover, 
I was compelled to find some kind of 
work that did not set so severe a strain 
upon my body. My difficulty in find- 
ing such a job convinced me of the 
necessity for an education. However, 
I found work as a domestic worker in 
the house of a Jefferson doctor, and 
was about to become proficient in my 
duties when the accident which aimed 
to make a beggar out of me crossed my 
way. 

I had been to Marshall, a nearby 
town where Wiley is located, in a tour- 
ing car with two others, and we were 
returning at the hour of two in the 
morning. A curve taken too fast and 
far turned the Ford turtle, both of my 
arms being crushed in the wreckage. 
For sometime there was hope of saving 
one of my arms, but blood poisoning 
set in and amputation of both my arms 
Was necessary—one just below the 
shoulder, and the other just below the 
elbow. After three weeks in the hos- 
pital, I was dismissed with a pamphlet 
ot a Dallas judge, who was armless 
and who could make devices by the 
use of which armless people could make 
themselves useful. 

I took the train to Jefferson after my 
release from the hospital. After I ar- 
rived there, I Was forced to walk 
seven miles into the country, for there 
Was no one at the station to meet me. 
Everybody I met deplored my condi- 
tion and advised me that they would 
rather have been dead. Only one per- 
son gave me hope: that was my mother, 


266 


Here is a story of education 
under almost insuperable difficul- 
ties. We could not refrain from 
supplying a trite but apt title. 


who met me with a smile and said, 
“How glad I am to see you alive”. 
This, and this alone, gave me a strong 
determination to live independently in 
spite of my handicap. 

One of the first things I did after 
getting home was this: I persuaded my 
brother to go with me to Dallas to see 
the judge who could make the artificial 
arms so cleverly. Judge Corley was 
at that time president of the White 
Engraving Company, but he found 
time to see us. I shall never forget 
the impression that he made on me— 
sitting there at his office desk, type- 
writing and carrying on his office du- 
ties just as any other man would. He 
stopped his work and showed me how 
he performed several duties, and then 
he drove me over to his factory and 
had me measured for an arm. We 
stayed in Dallas a week while the de- 
vice was being made. When we left, 
the judge said many encouraging 
things to me, advising my brother to 
refrain from helping me very much 
in order that I should be taught to 
shift for myself. Before this time they 
had to care for me like one would care 
for a one year old baby. 

The doctors at the hospital told me 
that the only way for me to make a 
living would have to be by means of an 
education. My parents agreed with 
this, but they had no money with 
which to educate me, nor did they 
have any prospects of getting money. 
Things were certainly looking dark 
for me, and I had almost given up all 
hope of ever becoming a self-supporting 
man. 

But at the time when despondency 
was greatest came the largest gift that 
ever I received. Three hundred dol- 
lars became available for my educa- 
tion! Nothing at this time serves more 
te convince me of the indispensability 
of well-directed charity, especially to- 
wards unfortunate beings, than the 
timeliness of this God-sent aid! 

My mother immediately looked 
about for a school where I could get 
that needed commodity—education. 
She wrote practically every school of 
note in the state of Texas, but the 
reply of every school was similar to 
this: “Sorry, but this is no school for 
cripples,” except in one case. Only 


one school in the state of Texas was 
big-hearted enough to give a chance to 
one who needed it more than any stu- 
dent in their rolls. That school was 
Wiley, whose president favored us 
with a personal reply expressing his 
particular interest in my case and his 
solicitude with regard to my misfor- 
tune. “I shall expect your son on 
Sept. 17”, were the closing words of 
his letter. 

So on the morning of Sept. 16, 
father and mother packed my things 
in an antique trunk of dimensions 12 
inches deep and about two and a half 
feet long, put the trunk on the wagon, 
and set out for Marshall. I shall 
never forget the contents of that trunk. 
There were 2 quilts, 2 sheets, 3 shirts, 
and underwear. My only suit was ex- 
actly where one would expect to find 
it—on my back. 

I was registered in Wiley, and on 
Sept. 18, 1919, I entered into my first 
day’s work in a college as a student in 
the seventh grade. At that time, 
Wiley carried high school and grade 
students, as well as college students. 
A few of the students seemed to regard 
me with a hostile air, as if they thought 
me to be in the way, but as I became 
used to the routine and grew in efh- 
ciency, this hostility dispersed. _ 

After a year at Wiley, I realized 
that the $300 would not put me 
through college, so I studied up a plan 
of traveling over the country, giving 
demonstrations of the manner in which 
one maimed for life could take care of 
himself, and exhibitions of skill in type- 
writing. The Church was to be my 
chief medium. In this way I was able 
to travel over forty states and parts of 
Canada and Mexico. This has been of 
great value to me, for it has made me 
understand that I am not the worst 
off person in the world. Certain news- 
papers, located in the places I visited, 
carried articles concerning me. Aside 
from this source of income, I was able 
to gather funds from another place: in 
1926, I got a downtown cleaning and 
pressing establishment to let me handle 
their campus business in consideration 
of a commission of 20% and my own 
work free. I have continued this up to 
the present time. 

I intend to study theology at North- 
Western next year, a thing which seems 
at this time well-nigh impossible i 
view of my financial condition. But 
[ feel sincerely that there is a way out 
of this difficulty, just as there was a 
way out of that difficulty back in the 
summer of 1919.

The Student Conference at Mysore, India 


By JULIETTE A. 


; 


Miss Derricotte, Secretary for 
Colored Student Work in the 
National Y. W. C. A., was one of 
six delegates sent from America 
to attend the General Committee 
of the World’s Student Christian 
Conference which met at Mysore, 


India, in December, 1928. 


Paris; five bright, blue, sharp, cold 
days in Geneva; and then Marseilles 
with bright colored roofs creeping one 
cver the other to the sky, with lazy, 
busy fishermen in their vari-colored 
sail boats, with folks whose skin was 
darker and whose eyes were softer, 
with smells,—we knew we were on the 
edge of a new world. 

Three long weeks on a little British 
Indian boat, full to capacity, with 
mostly the British military on their 
way to Africa and India ‘‘to protect 
the interests of the English govern- 
ment” (and, incidentally, to live on 
a plane which would be impossible for 
them anywhere else in the British em- 
pire. ) 

On we ploughed in spite of a broken 


DERRICOTTE 


propeller-blade thru the Mediter- 
ranean, that most beautiful and human 
of all the seas; thru the Red Sea, with 
glimpses of Africa—a long curve of 
staggering, quiet, rugged, black hills 
with a blaze of pure gold rising out of 
them at sunset and flooding the whole 
sky. And then the dull, glassy, blue 
Arabian Sea, with jelly fish, flying 
fish, and an occasional shark to break 
the monotony of the sun’s glare. 

Thanksgiving night—a full moon in 
a sky full of stars; a tiny light away 
off on the horizon, another, another; 
a long irregular line of lights then 
dark shadows which grew into low, 
dark hills; small white, sail boats dart- 
ing back and forth in the path of our 
searchlight; voices, the pilot—so this 
is Bombay. 

Here I was really in India. For 
seven weeks I lived and moved and 
had my being with all the kinds of 
folks who make up that land. I lived 
in Y. W. C. A.’s with Anglo-Indians, 
in the furnished camp of a Maharajah, 
in a deserted military camp with five 
hundred students from India, Burma,

THE POETS CORNER 


Dark Waters 
By MARION GREEN SCOTT 


ARK waters trouble my soul; 
The lightnings flash, 

The thunders roll, 

And tar and wide 

O’er ocean’s breast 

The crashing waves 

With whitened crest 

Leap to engulf, enfold 

Our ship hard prest 

By raging storm. 


I heed it not, the crash of raging ele- 


ments, 
The thunder in the tom-tom’s beat; 


The wind, the sound of wailing flutes; 


The rushing waves 
Are rolling ceremonial drums; 


That loud lament the passing of a chief, 


While agile braves, 

Daubed with the mud of grief, 
Weave swiftly to and fro 

In mystic dance; 

The Witch-man waves 

His magic wand, 

Lest this new grave 

Be cursed by evil charm. 

My soul is filled with awe, 

My senses swim 

At excess of emotion; 

My eyes grow dim. 

For I—I am a part of all 
This visioned scene. 

My heart attunes its strings 
To vibrate to its rhythm. 

Life shows its power stark 

And primitive and so I am deprest 
By waters dark.

Enigma

I 


ives a girl who’s honey-brown, 
Honey-brown and sweet to meet 
As you pass along the street. 
But the sorrows in her eyes 
Are like rain from winter skies 
And a voice when she’s alone 
Asks her with a weary moan: 

“Why is it abhorréd sin 

To be born with darker skin? 
Who has raised this frowning ban 
On a slightly richer tan? 
Building in colossal mass 
Barriers we must not pass. 
So much that we cannot see, 
Hear, or touch, for any fee— 
O that I were white and free!” 


A mile or two from Harlem town, 
Incongruously further down, 

On a wider, richer square 

Lives a girl who’s flower-fair, 
Flower-fair and sweet to meet 

As you pass along the street. 

And the laughter in her eyes 

Is like sun from summer skies 

But a voice when she’s alone 

Says to her with frenzied tone: 
“Stop and listen to the din 

Of this vogue for sunburned skin. 
For heaven’s sake devise a plan 

To acquire an Afro-tan. 

Or the ultra-smart en-mass 

Will cry out: “Thou shalt not pass! 
Go and get a bronzed physique, 
Your pale face is just a freak.’ 

O that I were dark and chic!” 


Caldecot 
By LESLIE PINCKNEY HILL 


N Huntingdon-shire, in Caldecot, 
Old England has a town 
The most forlorn of earth, I wot, 
In sinister renown. 


The village lanes are blossom-bright, 
Like emerald plush, the green, 

And trees look from a giant height 
On houses prim and clean. 





3ut though you breathe the morning 
bloom, 

And hear the lintwhite sing 

In Caldecot, an inward gloom 

Envelops everything. 


For never in a flowered lane, 
And never on the green, 

And never at a window pane 
Are children’s faces seen. 


Old women speak the welcome word, 
And old men say good-bye, 
And never is a bosom stirred 


To hear a baby cry. 


And no one tarries long; for who 
Could bear to build or bake, 
Or do aught else that mortals do, 
But for the children’s sake? 


Go, then, to Caldecot, and see, 
If but for one awed minute, 
How dark a sun-lit world can be 
With no more children in it. 


Questioning 
By EDA LOU WALTON 


N the night 
I have lain awake 
In moonlight 
Asking, ““Why, why, 
Is he mine? 
I have done nothing 
To deserve him, 
Nothing to be thus blessed 
In his nearness.” 


But when the moon 
Was cloud-hidden, 

I have cried, 

Asking, ‘Why, why 
Is he gone from me? 
I have done nothing 
Thus to lose him, 
Thus to be distressed 
In his absence.” 





Sunset

‘Tae sun goes slowly 
Down the golden ladder 

That swings from heaven 
To where a fringe of pines 
Tops the distant hill. 
Step by step he goes 
Till near the end 


He takes a sudden leap 
And disappears. 


So you went slowly 

Down the ladder of the years 
Smilingly step by step 

Till one late afternoon 

You took the sudden leap 
And passed beyond my ken.

RISIS 


Augusta Savage 


WAS born in Florida of poor par- 

ents. I am the seventh child in a 
family of fourteen. Nine of us 
reached maturity. My father, who 
was burned to death in January this 
year, Was a minister and very fond of 
good books. At the mud pie age, I 
began to make “things” instead of mud 
pies. I had very little schooling and 
most of my school hours were spent 
in playing hookey in order to go to the 
clay pit—we had a brick yard in our 
town—and made ducks out of clay. 

Our family moved to West Palm 
Beach in 1915, and as there was no 
clay soil down there, my clay model- 
ling was at a standstill, until I chanced 
to pass a pottery on the outskirts of 
the town and having begged a bit of 
clay from the potter, I resumed my 
modelling. The objects created from 
this clay was brought to the attention 
of the superintendent of the county 
fair which was due to open within 
three weeks. This man, the late Mr. 
George Graham Currie, persuaded me 
to enter my models in the fair, which 
I did. Being the only work of its 
kind on exhibit, it created a small sen- 
sation. A special prize of $25 was 
awarded me, and this together with 
public contributions donated by the 
tourists with the admonition to go to 
New York and study art, netted me 
$175. 

I persuaded my family to let me go 
to Jacksonville, Florida, where I hoped 
to “do” the busts of all of our rich

colored people there and so make 
enough money to finance my art career. 
I am thankful to say that the said rich 
folks refused to be “done” and I was 
soon almost stranded. I managed to 
pay my fare to New York and arrived 
with a balance of $4.60 and a deter- 
mination to learn sculpturing in six 
months. I was directed to Cooper 


Union by the late Solon Borglum and 
was accepted on the merits of my work. 
After three months, 1 was forced to 
quit school and go to work, but was 
recalled and offered a working scholar- 
ship, which provided for my room and 
board and carfare, 1921-1922. 

In 1923, I applied for, and was 
granted a scholarship which entitled 
me to study at Fountainebleau, France. 
[On the American Committee was 
Whitney Warren, Ernest C. Peixotto, 
Edwin Blashfield, Howard Greenley, 
Thomas Hastings, Herman MacNeil 
and James Gamble Rogers.] When it 
was discovered that I was black, the 
Committee withdrew the scholarship. 

In 1925, through the efforts of Dr. 
W. E. B. Du Bois, I was granted a 
working scholarship which entitled me 
to study at the Royal Academy of Fine 
Arts at Rome, Italy; but as I had to 
pay my travelling expenses and as that 
was impossible to me, I was unable 
to take it. 

In 1929, through the efforts of Mr. 
John E. Nail and Mr. Eugene Kin- 
ckle Jones of the National Urban 
League, I have been granted the Julius 
Rosenwald Fellowship for two years’ 
study abroad. ‘The Fellowship was 
originally for $1,500 per year, but has 
been raised to $1,800. 

I have exhibited at the 135th Street 
Branch Library, New York; Douglas 
High School, Baltimore. Maryland; 


and at the Sesqui-Centennial, Phila-

Hughey Arnette of Tacoma, Wash-

was student at the Stadium High 
School, he was found to be a good 
debater and was urged by the English 
teacher and debate coach to turn out. 
He won every debate in which he took 
part. He was one of the three debat- 
ers from the Senior Class to debate 
with the Lincoln High School. He 
won three to nothing with all Lincoln 
judges. He received his Letter as a 
debater. 


Then he entered the College of Puget

loving-cup. This is proceeded by a 
try-out. Hughey won at the try-out, 
but the Society refused to appoint him. 
Hughey protested, and the Dean told 
him he would make himself unpopular

Countee Cullen in England 


London, May 18, 1929 


LL the year I had said, with a 

boundless faith in Browning, “I 
shall go to England in April. Surely 
then the lilacs will be out in Kew; the 
lark will be soaring; and the thrush 
will be singing each song twice over.” 
But I had forgotten that London is 
not all England. April in London 
was like late September, quite unlike 
the glorious sun-dappled weather we 
had left behind in Paris; even now in 
mid May it is only the intrepid soul 
who has doffed his top coat in London. 
And like the weather was the district 
into which I first moved, the London 
boarding house environ where all the 
houses are alike advertising bread and 
breakfast at two pounds and a half per 
week, with no mention of the numer- 
ous pennies that must be placed in the 
little gas slot if one wishes to keep 
from freezing; dull and sober places, 
each like the eye of some Argus of 
stone reflecting back the frigid gaze of 
its brother across the way. I began 


to pine for the rich warmth of Paris, 
and the budding trees of the Parc 
Montsouris which I could see every 
morning from my window and whose 
leaves I could hear each night sighing 


and soughing in the wind. . . Then 
like salvation out of the sky came a 
friend with an invitation to come to 
Surrey and spend a few days seeing the 
English country side. . . . Those were 
crowded days, because they had to be 
few, as the friend was leaving soon to 
teach in some mountain fastness in 
Switzerland. Then I saw how blue 
an English sky can be those rare mo- 
ments when the grayness has been 
routed from them, how unbelievably 
green the grass can be, how golden 
the crocuses, as if touched and gilded 
by a Midas’ hand. I saw enmeshed in 
a bit of wiring for one agitated and 
fear-freighted moment a_ blackbird, 
and I had time to note the opulent yel- 
low of its beak before it extricated it- 
self and zithered away. I laughed at 
the puffy, squire-like breast the robin 
flaunts; I heard the strange, shrill cry 
that is made by the chiff-chaff who is 
the harbinger of spring. I heard the 
thrush exemplify his reputed wisdom 
by singing his lay over not twice but 
many times. And there was a gay, 
good-humored lark who trilled us a 
sermon one morning on our way to the 
little country church that dated back 
to the thirteenth century; we could 
not see the songster because he was up 
in the very face of the sun and our 
earthy sight could not brazen out that 
brilliance, but we knew the singer was 


270 


there by the drops of music which 
sprayed us like a silver cascade falling 
from the skies on to the thirsty earth. In 
three days I think I learned why Eng- 
lishmen are so proud of their little 
island in the sea and why the songs 
of their poets are so vainglorious. I 
carried a lighter heart back to London 
town thanks to my friend who rescued 
me at a crucial moment. He is find- 
ing a new sort of loveliness in Swit- 
zerland, but none more radiant than 
that of his own Surrey. . . . Then 
back to London and out of Russell 
Square to lodgings on Edgware Road, 
a noisy boisterous thorofare whose 
one redemptive feature is the legend 
that once Francis Thompson used to 
haunt its purlieus, Thompson whose 
music was as mighty and as intense 
as Milton’s, if less ambitious. As I 
walk the streets of Edgware Road, it 
is pleasant to think that here, perhaps 
on this spot where I place my foot 
with such unconcern, was probably 
composed a line or more of The Hound 
of Heaven. Poor Thompson, what 
an ostensible direlict he was, and yet 
how favored and radiant a spirit, for 
surely he communed with splendors 
with whom more respectable people 
had not even a bowing acquaintance. 
At the end of Edgware Road, stands 
the famous Marble Arch through 
whose portals no vehicle is allowed to 
pass except the king’s. And directly 
in back of the arch is Hyde Park 
where I have passed many a jolly eve- 
ning listening to the political and re- 
ligious harangues for which this spot 
is famous. Here the different sects 
of Christianity, side by side, Catholic 
and Protestants in their various guises, 
sell Christ like merchandise across a 
counter, each trying to outbid his com- 
petitor. And here and there scattered 
throughout the crowd are the buzzing 
flies in the ointment, pointing out with 
much raillery and good humor the de- 
fects of the various systems. It re- 
minds me of a slave on a block, but 
this slave has a running side and his 
hands and feet are mutilated with the 
rough caress of nails. . . . Then Lon- 
don began to be hospitable to me and 
I began to meet people, and to learn 
how charming the English can be, and 
how effortless that charm can appear. 
. . » I am still astounded at the assid- 
uity and disinterestedness with which 
the Quakers, especially Winifred 
Cramp and John Fletcher, have en- 
deavored to find me readings and hos- 
pitality in other English towns, Bris- 
tol, and Oxford and Sydenham; I shall 
never cease to marvel at the intense 
pleasure which Winifred Holtby, an 


English novelist, took in helping me 
to place a few poems with English 
journals and in aiding me to get a 
reading or two, aware as she was of 
the usual sad state of the bardic purse. 
. . . One or two personalities stand 
out in mellow relief for happy remem- 
bering: Humbert Wolfe, a gifted poet 
who is also sane enough to be in the 
government employ, having me in for 
tea one afternoon at the Ministry of 
Labour (for the heavens may fall and 
the earth be buried thereunder, but 
the drinking of afternoon tea in Eng- 
land, I ween, will stand forever. It 
is a custom as ritualistic as going to 
bed and rising, and far more regular; 
tea is served in theatres and movie 
houses during the intermission nearest 
four o'clock and in every English 
household) ; John Galsworthy, veteran 
wielder of the pen, waving the wand 
of welcome over us at a dinner of the 
P. E. N. Club; May Sinclair sitting 
on one side of us, answering in mono- 
syllables and crisp sentences our timid 
endeavors to draw her into talk; Hen- 
rietta Leslie on the other side of us, 
gay and delightfully garrulous, treat- 
ing us to wine in spite of our remon- 
strances, and pointing out the celebri- 
ties. . . . Then etched in our memory 
more than any of these is the little 
lady in the gray coat who was waiting 
in the anteroom at Friends House the 
same day I was there. We had both 
come to see John Fletcher. Her in- 
teview was first, but it had hardly be- 
gun before John Fletcher came out 
and said, “I want you to come in and 
meet Ethelreda Lewis.” And _ this 
frail, mild-mannered lady who I had 
thought surely was the head of some 
Ladies’ Aid Society had given us 
Trader Horn with all its wild and 
fierce adventurings. “It amuses me,” 
she said, “when they accuse me of be- 
ing the sole author of Trader Horn; 
for I was forced to give up my school- 
ing when I was thirteen, whereas 
Aloyisius Horn had a splendid educa- 
tion extending through his eighteenth 
year.” I feel sure that the saints on 
earth today are few and form a most 
eclectic society; but I am equally sure 
that Ethelreda Lewis belongs in that 
number. I have not been able to an- 
alyze the reason; I do not care to an- 
alyze it; all I know is that she gives 
one a feeling which is out of and be- 
yond the flesh. I was as conscious 
of that aura about her as I was aware 
of the shining circle of white hair 
coiled about her head, as I was aware 
of her unconsciousness of her own 
spirituality. Not a political person at

Christianity and Race 


By C. F. ANDREWS 


HE Christian religion at its in- 

ception stood out boldly for racial 
equality. There were violent contro- 
versies within the early Church, but 
the race question was settled once and 
for all when the declaration was 
finally made, that there could not pos- 
sibly be any distinction between the 
Jew and the Greek, the barbarian and 
the Scythian, the slave and the free- 
man, because all were one humanity in 
Christ Jesus. 

This charter of race equality was 
never seriously questioned by any 
Christian until the evil days of the 
slave trade and the setting up of that 
cruelest of all racial distinctions be- 
tween slave and slave owner. Race 
Churches in which the races worship 
separately were originally slave 
churches. They arose out of this, bru- 
tal distinction between races on a slave 
basis. 

Though it was the disgrace of my 
own country to fight fiercely to retain 
the monopoly of the slave traffic be- 
tween Africa and America, yet it was 
also the glory of Great Britain that 
she gave many of the noblest pioneers 
in the long struggle for the abolition 
of Slavery. An historian has said that 
perhaps the one purely disinterested act 
in modern politics has been the Aboli- 
tion of Slavery. It is with an infinite 
relief that one reads how our own fore- 
fathers carried through that struggle 
to the end, and how the victory spread 
from one country to another to the 
ends of the world. 


This same victory reverberated in a 
thousand other directions. It gave a 
generous outlook to the Nineteenth 
Century, making it the greatest cen- 
tury of humane liberalism in all hu- 
man experience. The breath of free- 
dom, which made a man fair-minded 
in thought and deed, spread over the 
earth. We have the Declaration of 
Racial Equality in India as early as 
1833. The whole colonial policy of 
Great Britain in Cape Colony, Natal, 
the West Indies, and in other critical 
racial areas, was decided at first on the 
same progressive lines. 

In other countries the same spirit of 
freedom also prevailed. Such outstand- 
ing figures as Lincoln in America, and 
Gladstone in Great Britain, made at 
last this one principle of racial equality 
fundamentally sure. Whatever diffi- 
culties might arise in practice, in the 
eyes of the law all men and all races 
are equal. This one truth thus seemed 
to have established itself finally for 


August, 1929 




















C. F. Andrews is an English- 
man who has lived for a genera- 
tion in India and is the friend of 
Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath 
Tagore and the leaders of free 
India. 

The following address was 
given at the Quadrennial Con- 
ference of the British Student 
Christian Federation held in 
Liverpool, January 5, 1929, at 
which nearly 3,000 University 
students, selected on a quota 
basis, were present from all the 
Universities of the British Isles. 
Mr. Andrews was invited to 
speak on “Racial Relations.” 


mankind in the same way that the 
Abolition of Slavery itself had done. It 
has been my own task many times over 
to study the official documents with re- 
gard to Indian and Colonial affairs 
during this great age of Liberal states- 
manship last century when Gladstone 
and Bright were in the ascendant. 
They declared that there must be 
nothing within the British Constitu- 
tion which meant in the eyes of the 
law racial inequality. Now and then 
great battles were fought over this 
issue, but the principle itself was al- 
ways acknowledged. It was this that 
made Mahatma Gandhi in early days 
such a profound believer in the British 
Constitution as the champion of racial 
freedom. 


But the pendulum has swung back. 
The reaction came towards the close of 
the Nineteenth Century. While equal- 
ity between the white races became 
acknowledged, equality outside the 
white races was questioned. What has 
sometimes been called the “Religion of 
the White Race” has even taken the 
place of the Christian religion. This 
“white race religion” has carried with 
it imperial domination and economc 
exploitation. With such immensely 
powerful adjuncts as these, it has been 
able subtly but surely to undermine 
the British Constitution itself and to 
leave it to-day in many parts of the 
world merely a facade without any 
substantial background. The Colonial 
Office, with its long traditions of racial 
equality, has often fought a brave fight 
against this reactionary tendency; but 
it has been obliged to give way and 
acknowledge in practice that there is 
one law for the white race, and an- 


Prejudice 


other law for the other races as in- 
ferior. 

Thus the Christian principle of ra- 
cial equality, which was upheld by the 
greatest statesmen of last century has 
been virtually abandoned in the Twen- 
tieth Century. The spread of white 
racialism has infected the Christian 
Church. When I was in South Africa, 
in 1913-1914, Mahatma Gandhi was 
refused admission to a Christian 
Church at Christmas tide, when he 
wished to hear me preach. An Indian 
Christian would have received exactly 
the same treatment, and so would a 
Chinese Christian or an African Chris- 
tian. We have thus got a religion to- 
day which calls itself Christian, but 
does not acknowledge the ultimate 
Christian principle of racial equality. 
It cannot truly say “We are all one 
humanity in Christ Jesus” because it 
does not believe this. 

_ When I came back from South Af- 
rica on a very short visit to England, 
early in 1914, and my heart was pained 
with the racialism within the Chris- 
tian Church which I had witnessed, I 
found the whole atmosphere filled with 
the Kikuyu controversy, intercommun- 
ion between the different Christian 
denominations and troubles between 
rival sects, while this racial wrong was 
destroying Christ’s religion at its very 
root. 

Th World War followed and the 
racial evil has grown worse and worse. 
Since the War, and in accord with the 
brutality of the war spirit, we have 
suffered terribly in India at Amrit- 
sar; in Kenya we have seen a racial 
franchise and a racial conscription im- 
posed; and we have had an unjust 
Colour Bar Act in South Africa. Is it 
to be wondered at, if the Simon Com- 
mission, on which only white men were 
allowed to sit, is called in India a 
“White Race Commission”? Mean- 
while churches that refuse communion 
to different races have spread a noxious 
epidemic which shows very little sign 
of abatement. Is Christ divided? 

I have not paused to argue the case 
for racial equality, but have taken it as 
one of the final facts of the Christian 
religion, just as it is also a final fact in 
the universal religions of mankind. The 
shame of which I have just spoken is 
this, that while, for instance, the faith 
of Islam and the Buddhist faith prac- 
tice as well as preach, yet over large

“T will agree with you that in a good 
many instances in travelling to and from 
the West Indies, one is discriminated 
against aboard the various steamship 
lines; but I think you find that discrim- 
ination carried on in most cases where 
the steamships are privately operated. 
For instance, if you or any of your 
friends wanted to come to the Bahamas, 
I am sure that you would not have any 
difficulty in securing proper accommoda- 
tion. 

Our Government, as you may know, 
is strictly an independent one, and we 
make our own local laws and run our 
own affairs to suit us. All of our steam- 
boats, suitable for the accommodation 
of first-class passenger traffic, are sub- 
sidized by our Government here, and we 
set the passenger regulations and rates of 
passage. So you need not have any fear 
about being ‘jim-crowed.’ Quite a large 
number of our people travel to and from 
the States, and they are properly cared 
for in every respect, including myself who 
have made several trips to New York 
during the past seven years, sometimes 
on the Ward Line boats, and sometimes 
on the Munson Steamship Line. The 
Munson especially, which have some very 
fine boats running down here, make 
the trip in just two and a half days. It 
might interest you to know that we also 
have at present an Air Line running 
from Miami, Fla., daily, making the 
trip across from the main-land in two 
and a half hours. So you see we are 
quite near to the States after all.

several very nice places that take Colored

THE CLEVELAND MEETING 


UR annual meetings develop usu- 

ally a certain distinct individual- 
ity. All of them are rather more than 
just meetings. They are human ex- 
periences and they develop according to 
their individual members and the times 
and the circumstances. They are the 
making and renewal of human con- 
tacts. They are inspirations. I have 
attended, I think, every annual meet- 
ing of the Association save one, includ- 
ing that initial conference in 1909; yet 
I am always astonished at the virility 
and novelty of these meetings. Very 
many organizations bring together 
larger numbers but usually they tend 
to develop a dead inner core of routine 
to which few pay attention while with- 
out is a great and glowing penumbra 
of social life which is inspiring and yet 
the inspiration tends to die because it 
lacks an inner sun of real heat and 
light. But every N. A. A. C. P. meet- 
ing has real messages and real discus- 
sion so that not only are its mass meet- 
ings instructive, but its business is in- 
teresting and the social life gets its 
tenor from the work. 


The problem of emancipation of 
black folk is discussed openly, thor- 
oughly, and sincerely. For the most 
part there is no evasion or apology. 
No one can attend a meeting like that 
in Cleveland and fail to know exactly 
what we propose to do. On Wednes- 
day, we had the history of the N. A. A. 
C. P. told again by Mary White Ov- 
ington and the essential democracy of 
our movement stressed. On Thursday 
night, Nannie Burroughs flayed race 
prejudice, declaring it more thoroughly 
organized than religion. Charles S. 
Johnson analyzed the economic founda- 
tion of race prejudice and showed that 
money income even more than race re- 
pulsions builds up caste. Edwin R. Em- 
bree of the Rosenwald Foundation em- 
phasized the fact that as the Negro 
more completely enters American dem- 
ocracy, he must assume a larger duty 
of playing his part, discovering talent 
and aiding it, and getting rid of envy. 
Friday night Mrs. Sallie Stewart repre- 
sented the organized colored women of 
America. William Pickens told of re- 
cent experiences in the South and Judge 
Ira W. Jayne defended the immigra- 


August, 1929 


tion from the South and warned against 
racial bellwethers. 

Sunday afternoon, seven thousand 
people in the endless Public Auditorium 
which can seat fifteen thousand, heard 
Congressinan Hamilton Fish speak 
much too apologetically of “social 
equality,” while Mordecai Johnson 
demonstrated the fact that America is 
lawless because of its violence towards 
the Negro, and religion impotent be- 
cause we cannot apply Christian ethics 
to black folk. Monday night before a 
packed house and an overflow audience 
of a thousand, Congressman DePriest, 
standing stolid and belligerent on two 
firm feet, declared that he proposed to 
demand every right of a Congressman 
“from the barber shop to tea in the 
White House.” Miss Eleanor Wem- 
bridge in an excellent statement noted 
that “as roads grow bad, manners be- 
come better, in America.” 

Finally came the great night of the 
Spingarn Medal, in the beautiful Mu- 
sic Hall of the Public Auditorium with 
an audience of three thousand and with 
Green’s ‘““No ’Count Boy” done as an 
opening by the Gilpin Players; and 
done exceedingly well, under Rowena 
Jelliffe. Charles F. Thwing bestowed 
the Medal happily in the presence of 
three other Medalists. Dr. Johnson 
made an affecting response and Col. 
J. E. Spingarn spoke inspiringly for 
three minutes. 

Of other things said and done, we 
shall talk later but one cannot forget 
that morning at the Cleveland Museum 
of Art with the discussion on Negro 
Art by the Director and others, a read- 
ing of poems by James Weldon John- 
son, and violin solos by Louia B. Jones, 
by far the most finished violinist of 
Negro America. On Sunday repre- 
sentatives of the N. A. A. C. P. 


“preached” in ten pulpits. 


HAMPTON INSTITUTE 


AMPTON is at last at the part- 

ing of the ways. Her third white 
Principal has resigned. We congratu- 
late Mr. Gregg. This is the best step 
of his administration. We do not say 
this carpingly but soberly. Mr. Cregg 
has tried hard but he was set an im- 


possible task and his fault was not to 
see it sooner. 


The next step is to appoint a colored 
Principal. The Trustees may hem and 
haw and seek and get another white 
man. If they do he too will fail and 
fail soon. Nor is the reason far to seek. 
Hampton is not Fisk nor Atlanta. 
Hampton led far ahead in a movement 
which Fisk tried to follow and Atlanta 
refused to consider. That path was 
an attempt not simply to placate the 
white South but to incorporate and in- 
tegrate it in the conduct of the school. 
This would have been difficult even if 
Hampton had had to deal only with the 
best whites of Virginia, and of the for- 
mer slave states. But dealing as she 
must mainly with a provinicial narrow- 
minded small Southern town she was 
maneuvered into an impossible posi- 
tion in which James E. Gregg became 
martyr and victim. 

Armstrong, the first Principal, was 
a kind-hearted philanthropist of fair 
education and sincere but narrow ideals. 
He gave his life to the work and made 
the shibboleth of “industrial” education 
popular. He himself believed in col- 
lege training, music and mathematics; 
but he was trying to emphasize hard 
steady skilled work for recently freed 
slaves. Frissell raised the shibboleth 
to a gospel which attacked college train- 
ing and discovered a “‘new” education 
in the so-called ‘Hampton Idea.” 
While Armstrong sought tolerance and 
silent acquiescence from the Southern 
whites, Frissell sought friendship and 
offered power. To secure this, he was 
forced to draw the color line more and 
more inside the school itself—separa- 
tion by race in dining rooms, guests’ 
houses, social assemblies, faculty activi- 
ties—indeed, the thing became so intri- 
cate and baffing that it took more time 
and energy to avoid introducing Co- 
lonel Carter to George Jones, than to 
teach carpentry and farming. 

This situation Gregg inherited; and 
not simply this: by Gregg’s time, white 
Hampton and white Virginia felt that 
Hampton belonged to them and that 
the students were there to sing for 
them, wait on table and guide them 
through the beautiful grounds. South- 
ern whites on the teaching force and 
Northerners with Southern principles, 
who enjoyed the Hampton salaries, in- 
tensified this abnormal situation, which 
finally flamed into two strikes: a strike 


277 


by Southern whites to compel “Jim- 
crowing” by law on the Hampton 
grounds, and a strike by students 
against the whole intolerable situation. 

What could a new Principal do? 
He could act like a Negro: separate 
himself from the intricate social con- 
tacts of white Hampton and white 
Southerners and seek to re-establish 
that social equality of teacher and stu- 
dent which is fundamental to educa- 
tion. He could try this and he would 
fail—fail because of the bitter resent- 
ment of the whites on the faculty and 
in the town, and fail because the Ne- 
gro students have been pushed too far 
from their teachers to be pulled back 
in less than a generation. 

The alternative is a black Principal ; 
and this involves two other difficulties: 
Can a colored Principal retain that pro- 
portion of white teachers so necessary 
to normal racial adjustment? Will the 
white trustees trust a black man to ad- 
minister eight million dollars’ worth 
of endowment? 


MINORITIES 


NE reason for the United States 

continuing to decline joining the 
League of Nations is because each 
League member is asked to engage by 
treaty to protect the racial and religious 
minorities within its borders. The 
Jews of Romania, the Germans of Po- 
land and Italy, and the Greeks of Tur- 
key, have invoked these treaty rights 
before the Council of the League, and 
while the Council has never taken dras- 
tic action, yet there is the power and 
the threat. We may talk learnedly of 
avoiding “political” entanglements in 
Europe, but one of the things we really 
fear in joining the League is giving 12 
million black folk a chance to appeal 
to the world with legal and moral 
right. 


VOTES 

HE last presidential election 

brought out an unusual vote— 
more than 10 million, it is estimated, 
over the election of 1924. Yet, even 
then the vote was small. There are at 
least 60 million citizens 21 years of 
age and over. Of these only 39 mil- 
lion voted in 1928 or 69 per cent of the 
voters and only one-third of our popu- 
lation, as compared with 80 per cent 
and one-half the population in England 
and Germany. Why is this? Because, 
as the New York Times has suddenly 
discovered, of ‘“‘the one-sided nature of 
the contest”. We have only the one 
party in the United States—the Demo- 
cratic-Republican combination for graft 
and privilege. Why not a third party? 
Because the Solid South forbids. Be- 


cause the political power of a rump 


278 


group of whites casting the vote of dis- 
franchised black and white laborers 
holds the balance of power and forbid 
a third party movement. And when- 
ever a cheerful idiot in the North 
wakes half up and cries—‘‘But—see 
here!” they yell, “Nigger!” and 
promptly he falls again into a scared 
and disturbed sleep. 


IMMIGRATION QUOTA 


OLORED America has been silent 

on the immigration quota con- 
troversy for two reasons: First, the 
stopping of the importing of cheap 
white labor on any terms has been the 
economic salvation of American black 
labor. As usual, we gain only by the 
hurt of our white fellow serfs, but it is 
not our fault and whenever these same 
laborers get a chance they swat us 
worse than the capitalists. Secondly, we 
are loath to invite more black folk to a 
land of color discrimination lest they 
suffer and lest they make us suffer more 
as certain foreign dark folk have by 
frustrating our efforts and misunder- 
standing our ideals. 


Nevertheless, in justice and decency 
at least one-tenth, and on the basis of 
the census of 1790, 23 per cent. of all 
future immigrants to the United States 
ought to be black men according to the 
“origins” basis of the present law. Such 
an immigration would be physically and 
morally better than the present Euro- 
peans contingent, and if less intelligent 
this is the fault of Christian Imperial- 
ism and not of native brain power. 
With decent schoois for Negroes here 
and in Africa this handicap would eas- 
ily disappear. 

But the Holy Whites, says Reed of 
Pennsylvania, 

“Have excluded from the quotas, the 
Chinese, the Malays, people in the 
barred zone of Southern Asia, and the 
Negroid tribes of central Africa; and, 
by almost universal consent, it was to 
the best interests of America that we 
should. . The colored people of 
this country have acquiesced in this.” 

““Acquiesced” is lovely. We also 
“acquiesced” in slavery, the systematic 
rape of our women, lynching, dis- 
franchisement and public insult. But 
there is a day coming when our ac- 
quiescence will not so naively be taken 
for granted. 


MORGAN 


LEMENT GARNETT MOR- 

GAN my friend and Harvard 
classmate, is dead. He was a fine fig- 
ure of a black man. He was one of 
the cleanest men I ever knew, without, 
and within. Some will remember that 
day when he was elected class orator 
of Harvard ’90. ‘The nation shook, 


and thereafter colored class orators 
were long and widely in fashion. 


Morgan was a grown man when he 
started to prepare for college at the 
Boston Latin School. Then he dog- 
gedly did Harvard College and the 
Harvard Law School. He was incar- 
nate will. He knew no defeat. Born in 
the shadow of slavery, he achieved the 
breeding of a gentleman and an Eng- 
lish diction that even New England 
envied. Hail and farewell, my friend! 


4A MESSAGE 


E republish from the Associated 
Press the following message: 


“To every American citizen the recent 
messages of President Hoover are a chal- 
lenge to patriotism and a call to duty. 


“ ‘Our whole system of self-government 
will crumble either if officials elect what 
laws they will enforce or citizens elect 
what laws they will support. The worst 
evil of disregard for some law is that it 
destroys respect for all law. For our 
citizens to patronize the violation of a 
particular law on the ground that they 
are opposed to it is destructive of the 
very basis of all that protection of life, 
of homes and property which they rightly 
claim under other laws.’ 

“We believe that Negro suffrage 
should be given an honest trial, that it 
was enacted for the ‘protection of the 
American democracy,’ and that the moral 
force of the country is behind President 
Hoover in his endeavor to combat those 
forces which are attempting to frustrate 
this effort. 

“Let us unite to give the Fifteenth 
Amendment an honest chance for com- 
plete enforcement. To the full extent of 
our example and influence let us support 
our President and the Constitution—the 
Constitution that is the instrument of 
our sacred honor, the protection of our 
homes and property, and the bulwark of 
our national existence.”

sage:

FUTURE 

“Assuming that higher educational 
opportunities should be approximately 
the same for both races, it is evident 
that the development of colleges and 
universities for the Negro race must be 
greatly increased in order that its needs 
and those of the country may be fully 
met. With opportunities for under- 
graduate work assured for the future, 
the next step in advance is the develop- 
ment of high-grade institutions offering 
genuine opportunities for research and

dians were curious but most cordial. 
I saw much of all that Katherine 
Mayo describes in “Mother India,” 
but more that she doesn’t mention; 
I met a wealthy Rajah (he owned one 
hundred cars, lived in a marble palace, 
but he was orthodox Hindu and be- 
lieved in purdah for women!) 

It was in this Rajah’s furnished 
camp, on the edge of the beautiful, 
clean, little city of Mysore in south- 
ern India, that our General Commit- 
tee met, about ninety of us from the 
British Isles, Holland, Germany, 
France, Norway, Sweden, Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia, Russia, Australia, 
New Zealand, black and white South 
Africa, China, Japan, Korea, India, 
Burma, Ceylon, Canada, and the 
United States. And this was how it 
came to pass that I got the trip around 
the world. 


To report a committee meeting is a 
dull procedure, and should I begin 
telling you of findings and resolutions 
and platform addresses and budget def- 
icits, and committee elections, your 
mind would go wandering as mine did 
one day in Mysvre. But let me tell 
you where mine wandered. We were 
talking finance, I think it was, and I 
thought how dull, is it really worth 
all the money it costs to come around 
the world for such a committee meet- 
ing? Like magic, I thought but look 
who’s here! A committee isn’t a dull 
affair after all, for off to my left sat 
a Britisher and an Indian whom I hap- 
pened to know had gone hard and fast 
in a discussion on England in India— 
(the young India woman, upon enter- 
ing church, had been told only a few 
weeks before that all the whites must 
be seated before they could give her a 
seat) ; in another direction sat my lit- 
tle Korean tent-mate who had kept 
me awake until 2 A.M. telling me 
that I knew nothing of prejudice, 
segregation, and discrimniation; that 
to know the real meaning of these 
words I’d have to be a Korean under 
a Japanese government; and not far 
from her was my newly made friend 
from Japan who had asked me a few 
questions about our immigration laws; 
and near her was the shy young Chi- 
nese secretary who could make you 
feel all the ache of the Chinese in their 
relation to Japan (the Japanese were 
in Tsinan while we were in Mysore). 
And the white South Africans had told 
of the real spiritual experience which 
was theirs when they could shake 
hands with Max Yergin. An Aus- 
tralian had said to me, when I think 
of all the unoccupied land in Austra- 
lia and see the swarming masses of the 
East on such limited land I feel ter- 
tibly, but when I think of all the 
complications of the Eurasian problem 
I’m glad for the white Australian pol-

the World’s Student Christian Federa- 
tion “That All May Be One.” 


Those of us who lived through those 
days and all the days come home with 
mingled feelings. I don’t know how 
to answer my friends who meet me on 
the street corner and say. “Did you 
have a wonderful time?” Of course it 
Was most interesting, but how can | 
say that I am no longer free; that the 
wealth as well as the poverty of India 
haunts me; that I ache with actual 
physical pain when I remember the 
struggles of all India today, religious, 
caste, economic, social, political; how 
can I tell of the control which oil and 
rubber and jute have in the relations 
of East and West, or explain how back 
of oil and rubber and jute are the more 
fundamental and eternal puzzles of 
economics, race, and religion? My 
head whirls but every now and again 
I remember “that there is so much 
more to know than I am accustomed 
to knowing and so much more to love 
than I am accustomed to loving’ and 
that somewhere ahead “All May Be 
One.” 


Hughey Debates 
(Continued from page 269) 


Society met and appointed him and 
Hughey to represent them, but it was 
too late to prepare, so the Altrurian 
Society did not take part and a college 
tradition was broken. 

Meantime, Hughey succeeded in 
getting on in two of the college de- 
bates: one at Pacific College at Seat- 
tle, and the other at St. Martin’s Col- 
lege at Lacey. The audiences went wild 
with enthusiasm over him. The de- 
cision went against Puget Sound at

Seattle but many in the audience 
thought the decision very unfair and 
due to Dean Lemon’s Ku Klux Klan 
tactics. 

Nevertheless, participation in these 
two debates entitled Hughey to a Let- 
ter but the College decided at first to 
give no letters this year. ‘They said 
the school was not able to buy them. 
Finally, letters were given out but 
privately instead of in Chapel as for- 
merly. Hughey got his Letter. 

May 14th, it was announced in 
Chapel that the new Pi Delta Chap- 
ter would initiate the next Saturday 
night. The colleagues of Hughey Ar- 
nette were to be initiated but Hughey 
was to be omitted. He complained to 
the Dean. The Dean finally showed 
him the constitution of the Pi Kappa 
Delta and said he had tried to find a 
colored debating Fraternity, but that 
he was unable to. 

The local chapter held their initia- 
tion and called the names of all those 
who had taken part in two or more 
inter-collegiate debates and were elig- 
ible; and then called Hughey Arnette’s 
name, and the speaker said: ‘“‘Not elig- 
ible on account of his race.” Shigeo 
Tanabe, a Japanese, was made Presi- 
dent of the local chapter! 

Hughey’s mother wanted us to tele- 
graph to the President, Dr. Edward 
H. Todd. But as she has already ap- 
pealed to him without redress, we 
doubt if any appeal from us would 
have done any good. Thus, the stud- 
ents of the College of Puget Sound are 
receiving from President Todd and 
Dean Lemon a fine education in 
American democracy.

heart, she has come to London from 
Johannesburg, South Africa (and may 
go to America) in an endeavor to raise 
funds for the South African native, 
funds with which to provide him with 
the decent recreation of which she 
says he stands so sadly in need. The 
state of the South African native seems 
not far removed from that of the 
American Negro slave when slavery 
was at its zenith. I hope Ethelreda 
Lewis may go to America and carry 
back for her South African project a 
considerable sum from American 
Negroes who, remembering their own 
not far distant lot, should be imbued 
with a sympathetic spirit for those in 
whose behalf Mrs. Lewis contends.

Church and Prejudice 
(Continued from page 271) 


areas those who profess the Christian 
faith do not practice it and thus Christ 
is divided. 

Again and again when we go abroad 
and even in England itself the question 
is put to us by those who belong to 
other religions: ““Why do you Chris- 
tians alone today uphold racial in- 
equality and judge men according to 
the colour of their skin?” We are often 
told that the Christian Religion is the 
religion of the White man and that it 
is a symbol of imperialism and haughty 
domination. If we protest that Christ 
never taught such things we are 
brought up against the fact that 
Christ’s followers practice this on a 
large scale. It is an African proverb 
which says: ‘““Your deeds speak so loud 
to me that I cannot hear what you say 
in your words.” It is these loud speak- 
ers all over the world—the dark deeds 
of Christendom—which are trumpeting 
forth race-domination from Europe. 
No wonder that the still small voice 


of the Holy Spirit of God cannot be 
heard. 


What then remains to be done? Are 
we to fold our hands? No. That is 
not what our forefathers did when they 
were faced with slavery. They laid 
down their lives for the truth. The 
one single death of John Smith of 
Demarara, the young missionary, who 
died for the slaves of the sugar plan- 
tations in British Guina did more to 
abolish slavery than all the other striv- 
ings put together. It gave the moral 
power behind the plea of Wilberforce 
and others, which carried it home to 
men’s hearts. 


What is needed today is a revival of 
the spirit of martyrdom and sacrifice 
for the Christian faith which we pro- 
fess. It is only those who have carried 
their faith to the test of action, those 
who have lived for their faith with the 
joyful consciousness that at any mo- 
ment they may be called upon to die 
for it—it is only these that are able to 
hold their own position without waver- 
ing when the crucial test comes. It is 
only these who can wrest victory out of 
defeat. There must be no compromise: 
no betrayal: no looking back. 

Because the issue is so grave: because 
it is a matter of life and death—not to 
you and me only, but to the Christian

Faith itself as it is lived and practised 
among men—for that reason, I have 
waited in England for this Liverpool 
Conference, in order that I might pass 
on to the young Christian students of 
this country, the moving indignation 
that we feel on account of the wrong 
that is being done and the determina- 
tion to right it. 


Very soon the call may come to finish 
what has been given to me to do in the 
life-span allotted by God; for I am 
nearing the age of sixty and the body 
has been tried by much illness in the 
tropics. But if it were only possible to 
deliver over this one supreme longing 
of my heart, for which we have 
struggled all these years, often appar- 
ently in vain—the longing of remov- 
ing from the fair name of Christ this 
racial reproach, and to bring to an end, 
for His sake, these racial Christian 
Churches, then I could joyfully leave 
the work to be carried on by those 
whose idealism is still untainted with 
timidity and whose young lives are still 
reckless with courage. For we cannot, 
we must not, swerve one hair’s breadth 
from the great charter of human soli- 
darity and human redemption, which 
Christ himself has given us: 

“In Him, there can be neither Jew 
nor Greek, barbarian, Scythian, bond 


nor free, for all are one Man in Christ 
Jesus.”

SOUTH CAROLINA 
HEN the Charleston News and 


Courier ‘acknowledges injustice 
to the Negro, no one surely can doubt. 
In a leading editorial the News and 
Courier comments upon the admission 
of the white South Carolina Teachers’ 
Association and says: 

The public is informed that the South 
Carolina policy of skimping the Negro 
schools, of employing inferior teachers 
for them, of providing them with com- 
paratively mean facilities in every way, 
enables the state not only to tax the Ne- 
groes but the white people too in the 
counties of preponderant Negro popula- 
tion for the schooling of the white chil- 
dren in the white counties. 





One would like to know whether this 
policy expresses the ideal of the South 
Carolina Teachers Association? Whether 
or not the members of the association 
be skilled, efficient instructors, the limit 
of their usefulness will be set by their 
individual and private aspirations and 
standards. Is the South Carolina 
Teachers Association with its more than 
six thousand white members content with 
the South Carolina policy of grinding the 
Negro schools, of holding them down to 
the lowest point possible in the equip- 
ment of their schools, whether in respect 
of teachers or houses and furnishings? 

Is the South Carolina Teachers As- 
sociation hostile to Negro education, or 
indifferent to it? 


White counties, other things equal, are 
likely to be the prosperous counties. The 
lands in a township containing five hun- 
dred white farmers will be worth five 
or ten times the lands in another town- 
ship containing five hundred Negro farm- 
ers. The property of a mill employing six 
hundred families where there i is a plant of 
fifty thousand spindles is worth two and 
a half million dollars, and that is a val- 
uation twenty or a hundred times as

great as is to be found in any correspond- 
ing acreage in a low country county in- 
habited by as many Negro laborers. 
Consequently, where there is this great 
wealth, the revenues necessary to carry 
on local county government can be and 
are raised on low assessments. In the 
counties of a preponderant Negro popula- 
tion, on the contrary, most of the prop- 
erty is owned by relatively few white 
people but the costs of county govern- 
ment are not lower in proportion to 
whole population than they are in a 
county where most of the inhabitants are 
white. Hence, assessments in these 
darker counties must be higher, propor- 
tionately, than in white counties, with 
the unavoidable result that many an own- 
er of tangible property is compelled to 
contribute to the state treasury two or 
three dollars to one contributed by a tax- 
payer in a white county, the constitu- 
tion prohibiting separate assessments for 
local and state purposes. Thus, we have 
a circle not merely vicious but iniquitous. 
On the one hand the high assessment in 
the Negro counties extorts from their 
white people cruel and unusual contribu- 
tions for legislative appropriations to the 
public schools, and on the other the cold- 
blooded and calculated policy of repres- 
sion of the Negro schools canalizes into 
the white counties streams of money 


from the counties where the black people 
dwell. 


@ John D. Barry has been carrying 
on an argument in his column in the 
San Francisco News concerning the 
ethics of “passing.” Some of his cor- 
respondents have asserted that a black 
child might be born of the marriage 
of two apparently white people because 
of reversion to a black ancestor. But 
Mr. Barry consulted the President of 
the Science League of America who 
said: 

It can be definitely stated that search- 
ing investigations have not revealed one 
single instance that justifies the claim 
made by medical science that in a family 
of several children born of a white par- 
ent and a Negro, some will show little 
or no signs of Negro blood in their com- 
plexions and others will be positively 
black. 

To which one might answer: “What 
difference would it make if one of the 
children were black?”

and former Minister and Deputy, is 
dead at Porto Prince. Mr. Mathon 
was a distinguished leader of the 
Haitian people. 

WEST AFRICA 
@ As many had anticipated, the Eng- 
lish have now come forward with 
claims for indemnification for the rub- 
ber plantation which was the begin- 
ning of the Firestone project. The 
English rubber planters made a com- 
plete failure in West Africa, both in 
rubber planting and in other large 
schemes of development. Their idea 
undoubtedly was to hold on until Eng- 
land took over the country. When the 
war precluded this and the Firestone 
Company came in under American pro- 
tection, the English are now presenting 
a large claim for damages; but they 
do not want to come into Liberian 
courts. 


@ An interesting exhibition of draw- 
ings by modern Negro Gold Coast art- 
ists has been held at the Imperial In- 
stitute, London. They seem to indi- 
cate a renaissance of Negro art on the 
West Coast with educated young Ne- 
gro artists. 


@ There were 191 persons who at- 
tended the Congo Jubilee and West 
African Conference at Leopoldville, 
Belgian Congo, in September, 1928. 
This is the Tenth conference of Prot- 
estant Missionaries which has been held 
and also the Jubilee of the missions

An ounce of application is worth a ton of abstraction—Booker T. Washington 


AN OUNCE OF APPLICATION 


The National Negro Business League has during the last twelve 
months added two noteworthy achievements to its long career of 
usefulness. A modest beginning has been made in the field of co- 
operative merchandising which promises, with the aid of other 
organizations to break down the Negroes’ economic deadline. 











A SURVEY OF 
NEGRO BUSINESS 


A CONSTRUCTIVE SERVICE 


In Winston-Salem, North Carolina 



















The Business League has conducted a survey of 
Negro business in thirty-three cities; 2,817 business 
enterprises were studied. The findings are printed 
in a convenient and attractive monograph which 
sells for fifty cents per copy. 






Thirty-five Negro Grocers organized 
into a co-operative buying association 
who now operate as C. M. A. Stores. 










“The record as a whole is a thoroughly creditable 
one and deserves the thoughtful study of all who 
are interested in the future of this important branch 
of American mercantile interests.” 
—Paul T. Cherington 
Director of Research 
J. Walter Thompson Company. 


A store remodelled according to scien- 
tific store arrangement plans. 






Devised and installed practical system 
of unit control for grocery stores. 





























“It is a very excellent contribution to 
Conducted Demonstration of nation- Negro business as well as to all classes of commercial 
activity.”
