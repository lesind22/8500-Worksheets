— A Fool and His Policy 
ca | Soon Part 


The above caption and an article dealing with the 
subject recently appeared in a very popular Insurance 
Journal. As it portrays in a very pointed way a very vital 
Same: ies: Geen matter, affecting all policyholders and insurance com- 
525-7-9 N. 2nd St. panies, we have decided to give further publicity to the 
mimend, Ve. matter, with the hope that it will cause many present, 
as well as prospective policyholders to put a much higher 
value upon their insurance protection, and to hold their 
policies until maturity or death. 


The public generally does not realize what a great waste, both to policy- 
holders and companies, lapsed policies are. Some think that it benefits a company 
to lapse a policy. Others have such little appreciation of the value of an insur- 
ance contract that they will join every new thing that comes along, regardless 
of its worth or value, and of course, drop the old policy. Still others try to get 
a policy in every company that will take them, even though they are not able 
to carry, in the proper way, more than one or two good policies. 


These unwise steps of so many policyholders make the insurance companies 
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars each year, in fees to agents and doctors 
to secure the business and in preparing records and issuing policies that are soon 
lapsed out; and which, when lapsed, require still further expense and time to 
make proper records of the lapsed business. 


The public should know that it takes nearly the whole of the first year’s 
premiums to pay for writing and issuing the business, making records and plac- 
ing the policy. Thus it is clearly seen that no company profits when a policy is 
lapsed. On the other hand, each person who lapses a policy before receiving any 
claim or benefit therefor, wastes both his money and insurance protection. In 
fact, the company and policyholder lose money when a policy is lapsed. That is 
why the caption, ‘tA Fool and His Policy Soon Part” gives a trite but truthful 
warning to all who take insurance and then lapse it. 


Ask for a copy of the booklet which shows what it means to have and to hold 
a Superior 3-in-1 Policy of the Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc., which pro- 
vides for One Small Premium, protection against Sickness, Accident and Death.

“Under State Supervision” 


HIS may have an unpleasant sound to the one who wishes to conduct his business, like his 
personal conduct, with the least possible interference from that peculiar thing, a Govern- 
mental Bureau. When the rules are all written out in plain words, however, and you have 
a reasonably fair chance at an even break if it comes to an interpretation by the courts, State 
Supervision is not so bad — something like the line of guide posts along a state highway which 
you and all your competitors have to travel. The road is good and all the bad places are plainly 
marked. With a good engine to start, and the machine in good working order, you make 
better time than if you had a helter-skelter race with your competitors, looking for short cuts. 


State Supervision in the Life Insurance business extends to everything. The Company has to 
meet certain financial requirements before a license can be had to do business at all. The word- 
ing of the policy has been subjected to interpretation by the courts, so that the policy, itself, 
has to conform to certain standard provisions. Investments of the Company are carefully speci- 
fied and appraised annually. Agents have to be certified by the Company before the State 
issues their licenses. Claims against the Company have to be reported periodically to find if 
the Company is treating its policyholders fairly. Surrender values in the policies have to be care- 
fully “reserved” from the receipts of the Company, and invested as specified by the State. 
Detailed reports have to be made to the State annually, or oftener; these reports are filed as 
public property and compiled by the State for public scrutiny. In addition, the State Super- 
visory officials send examiners into the offices of the Company periodically, to determine if the 
Company is conforming to State requirements in the conduct of its business. 


State Supervision might be conceived as a deadening influence to initiative in developing the 
Life Insurance business. Under State Supervision, however, the business has developd into one 
of the great divisions of financial enterprise — probably because the supervisory officials, being 
human, like to see things grow rather than tear down profitable enterprise. To a young Com- 
pany, State Supervision is invaluable for the instruction and guidance of its officers in building 
a stable and enduring enterprise. 


The Victory Life Insurance Company is incorporated under the laws of the state of Illinois, 
and in addition, is conducting its business under the supervision of the Insurance Departments 
of Missouri, Texas, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, Virginia, District of 
Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York. This is the only Life Insurance Company 
owned and operated by Negroes under the Supervision of the New York Insurance Department. 


Supervision from all these Insurance Departments — some of the most exacting Insurance ofh- 


cials in the world — should have some influence on the Life Insurance Service we are peculiarly 
fitted to give you.

 RISIS 





HE Young Blood sits—back to 

an Eternity—face toward an 

Eternity. Hands full of the 

things ancestry has given—thriving on 

the things today can give—guided vo- 

cationally—inducted _spiritually—fed 

on -vitamines—defended against dis- 
eases unthinkable—hungry. 

The Young Blood hungers. 

It’s an old hunger. The gnawing 
world hunger. The hunger after right- 
eousness. 

—I speak not for myself alone. 

Do not swiftly look and think you 
see and swiftly say, “It is not, most 
certainly, a hunger for righteousness 
this Young Blood feels!” 

But it is. It is the Hunger. 

Some Young Blood feels it—and 
then they see if they can out-strip it— 
if they can get rid of the gnawing—try 
to dance it off as a man smokes off a 
trouble—try to float it off on a 
drunken sea—try to cast a spell on it. 


Daze it off. 
OMETIMES the Old Blood per- 


ceives the hunger and offers food: 
“It’s the World Hunger,” the Old 
Blood says. “It’s the Hunger-After- 
Righteousness. Take God. ‘Take 
Him as we have taken Him.” 

That is what the Old Blood says: 
“Take God—Take Him as we have 
taken Him.” 

And the Young Blood sits still hun- 
gry and answers: ‘“‘Not your God as 
you had Him.” 

The Young Blood sits. The Young 
Blood hungers yet. They cannot take 
God as the Old Blood takes Him. 

Not God sitting at the top of a mi!- 
lion worn orthodox steps. God in the 
old removed far-off Heaven. Not 
God showering thunder-wrath and 
stripping man of all Life’s compensa- 
tions to prove him righteous. Not God 
always offering a heavenly reward for 
an earthly Hell. Not God poured out 
in buttered sentences from the pulpit 
four or five times a month. Not the 
Old Blood’s God demanding incessant 
supplication—calling for constant fear. 

Not the Old Blood’s God—but the 
God His own Son said that He really 
is. His own Son, Jesus, who knew 
Him better than any earth-born crea- 
ture knew Him. Jesus who said that 
He was a friendly father who wanted 
respectful fear and confidential chats 
and obedience to principle and coopera- 
tion and thanksgiving as much as He 
wanted supplication.—I speak not for. 
myself alone, Lord. The Young Blood 
hungers.—

The Young Blood Hungers 


A Prize Essay by MARITA O. BONNER 


Qn 10>: 


Growing Pains 





> 


HE Old Blood argues: ‘You 

don’t seek God in too-brief gar- 
ments and _ too-tinted cheeks—too 
fancy-free dance steps—too fancy-free 
Thoughts-about-Things.” 

Perhaps not—but how? 

Up the million steps? Removed? 
Far? How? How? 

The Young does not know. The 
Young hungers. 

The Young Blood hungers and 
searches somehow. The Young Blood 
knows well that Life is built high on 
a crystal of tears. A crystal of tears 
filled with Illusory Veils of Blind Mis- 
understandings and _ Blunderings. 
Enough filmy veils wet with tears, 
stamped down hard beneath your feet 
to let you rise up—out—above—be- 
yond. 

Just think of the number of veils 
cast down! Just think of the tears to 
pack them down hard so you can stand 
on them. 

Yet that is growing. 

The Young Blood knows that grow- 
ing means a constant tearing down of 
Illusory Veils that lift themselves thin 
—filmy—deceptive—between you and 
truth. Veils that flutter breath-thin 
across things and make you mistake the 
touch of Heaven for the touch of Hell. 

Veils—breath-thin—so thin you feel 
them rather than see them. 


EARING down Illusory Veils. 
1 Jesus called it watching. Such 
watching that I of myself and you of 
yourself cannot do it alone. Veils lift 
themselves sometimes in the still of 
the night when even the soul is asleep. 
Eyes that kept Israel and did not slum- 
ber nor yet sleep are needed to help 
with the tearing down. 

I speak not for myself alone, Lord. 
The Young Blood hungers for Eyes 
to watch.— 

All this the Young Blood knows. 
All this and more. 

Young Blood knows that some 
Truths solidified in Eternity will not 
rot until Eternity crumbles. Solidified 
in Eternity. One love perhaps is to 
be pure and clean or it is not love. 
When the mists of Half-Lies play 
around the face of a truth—Lord— 
the Young Blood hungers. 

Solidified in Eternity—Rooted and 
tipping in Eternity. Young Blood 
knows this. And yet if you fumble 





through the mists of Half-Lies-About- 
Things to feel the Truth-About-Real- 
Things safe—sound—solid — behind 
you—are you a crab—a prude—out of 
step with your age? 

Are there no regular drum-beats? 
Can’t you mark your step to one drum 
that beats from the rim of Eternity 
up through the Dark Ages—through 
the Middle Ages—through Renais- 
sances—through Wars and Remakings- 
of-Worlds—to the same rhythm? 

Is there not a pulse-beat you can feel 
—beating—steady—Bloody Reigns and 
Terrors and Inquisitions and Torments 
—up to Hells-of-Republics and back? 


R is it, after all, a new gait for 
every new day? 

A new drum? 

A new rhythm? 

A new pulse-beat? 

A new step? 

A new Heaven? 

A new Hell? 

Today, a Truth. Tomorrow, a Lie. 

Everything new. Raw and new. 
No time to root before the sun sets 
its first rays of a new day dawning. 

The Young Blood hungers for 
Truth for God. For the God they 
called Jehovah when Christ was yet 
to come. Where is Jehovah ?— 

A brief breath of a paper-weight- 
dress — slippers—perfumed—curled— 
rouged even. Can’t you toss your soul 
out—up—beyond the mere room-full 
of brief breaths of dresses—perfumes— 
curls—rouge—and walk and talk to 
God? 

Must you come—eyes down-cast—to 
an altar four or five times a month to 
meet God of a Sabbath morn? Can 
you only commune with Him when 
you take Christ’s body and blood on an 
appointed day from hands not always 
too free from blood—before eyes that 
seem to lick out and eat up—lusting 
for Young Blood? Isn’t it the call for 
God thrilling in the voice of Young 
Blood when it is lifted in song—no 
matter the song? 

Isn’t it God seeking God in the 
question of Young Blood when it asks: 
“Do you understand things? Some- 
times I am afraid? Do you under- 
stand ?” 


F Young Blood knew how to con- 
verse with God—would so many 
Young feet stumble in the drunken 
mazes of seeking to find Self—seeking 
to find Truth—seeking to drown cries 
within—seeking enchantments to fill

E laugh at the isolation of the 

world of 1814, when the Battle 
of New Orleans could be fought sev- 
eral months after the signing of the 
peace between England and the United 
States at Ghent, and before news of 
the treaty reached the States. Yet not 
until the end of July, 1927, did news 
of the May earthquake in back China 
which killed 100,000 people reach the 
United States; and not until August 
2, 1927, did the United States learn 
of the June 20th jailing of the seven 
most prominent editors, and the two 
most important popular leaders, in the 
capital of Haiti, an island whose sky 
is uneasy with the dominant American 
flag, and whose administration is sup- 
ported by our armed Marines. 


The news has now been spread 
across inside pages of American news- 
papers. The men, whose sole offense 
was to criticize a whitewashing of the 
Borno administration by an _ ousted 
Mexican Catholic prelate, have been 
in jail more than six weeks already, 
held incommunicado from the world. 
They include Percival Thoby, the dis- 
tinguished diplomat and _ historian; 
Ern. G. Chauvet, editor of Le Nouvel- 
liste, a third jailing; Charles Moravia, 
editor of Le Temps, a fifth jailing ; and 
Jolibois Fils, editor of Le Courricr 
Haitien, a fifteenth jailing. There has 
never been a trial in any of these jail- 
ings, as far as I have been able to 
ascertain. 

Such a situation demands informa- 
tion. To secure it, I spent six weeks 
in Haiti this spring. The United 
States is entitled to some light on the 
armed Uplift functioning in its name. 


O man stands higher in the hearts 

of Haitians than Jean-Jacques 
Dessalines, the liberator of the land, 
in 1803, from the imperial claws of 
France. Toussaint L’Ouverture, the 
betrayed statesman; Alexandre Pétion, 
the first president; Henri Christophe, 
the bare-footed black Napoleon from 
the North—all of these were giants: 
but Dessalines, the dark sword that 
beat the bright sadistic Frenchman for- 
ever to his knees, is coigned cordially 
highest. 

Midway of the parked Champs de 
Mars in Port-au-Prince, stretching 
from the dazzling white palace of gov- 
ernment to the residenced seaward- 
gazing rim of the green space, stands 
an impressive iron statue of Dessalines, 
iron sword lifted against the white cal- 
lousness of the sky. A legend is whis-

pered that, when the statue lowers its 
sword, this will be the signal for the 
natives to uprise and massacre all of 
the whites. The natives thrill to this; 
the Marines of the American Occupa- 
tion know it, and remember it. 


WO nights before we reached Port- 

au-Prince, a drunken Marine, re- 
turning through the great curves of the 
park, halted before the statue of the 
liberator. He fell to his knees, aimed 
his pistol, emptied its chamber at the 
looming man of irdn. ‘He aimed his 
sword down at me,” the Marine ex- 
plained the next day. With this, the 
matter died down; although Ameri- 
cans might show some slight indigna- 
tion if a foreigner were to try target 
practice on the St. Gaudens Lincoln 
in Washington. But this was Haiti. 
Here the American flag floats high, 
shadowing the dusky tricolor of the 
Antillean Negro dream come almost 
true. Haiti: islanded home of strange 
and unsuspected activities of the 
American Uplift super-imposed upon 
the American Occupation of the coun- 
try. 

The Americans have bored in firmly, 
somewhat as the fabled camel bor- 
rowed the tent of his ousted master. 
The boring tactics have been consis- 
tent: predominantly American with- 
holding of the pay of Haitian officials 
until they “agreed” to the treaties pre- 
pared by our State Department, and 
various laws urged by the Americans.? 
Then came a millennial hint: the Oc- 
cupation would be withdrawn, if the 
more euphemistic Uplift was accepted. 
Pierre Hudicourt, outstanding Haitian 
nationalist, chairman of the commis- 
sion prevented, by barbed wire and log 
barricades, from greeting United 
States Senator W. H. King of Utah 
in Haiti, midway of March, 1927, had 
been the delegate of the nationalist 
Union Patriotique to Washington, at 
the time the Uplift was designed. As 
representative of the intransigents 
among the Haitian people, he was as- 
sured by the official spokesman of our 
secretary of state that the Occupation 
would leave, when the Uplift came in.

Il. 

HE Occupation consists of one or 

more brigades of Marines, quar. 
tered throughout Haiti. The Uplift 
consists of General Russell, of. our 
Marines, as High Commissioner, repre- 
senting our State Department; of q 
native gendarmerie, officered by officers 
of the American Marines, who draw 
simultaneous salaries from Uncle Sam 
and Nephew Haiti;? of Financial Ad- 
viser° Cumberland, in constant ‘con- 
sultation with President Borno; and 
of representatives of the National City 
Bank of New York, the Navy, the 
Marines, the Department of State, and 
other American institutions. It has 
not yet extended its sway over classi- 
cal education or stamp collecting. Out- 
side of these and a few other insignif- 
cant exceptions, it functions in the 
same mildly comprehensive manner 
that the Mississippi functions in flood- 
time. 

Landing in Haiti is a hectic experi- 
ence. Miultitudinous colored func- 
tionaries, red-capped or gold-braided, 
kidnap your luggage piece-meal, and 
lope ahead of you down a blistering 
purgatorio of a wharf to the custom 
house. If you know no French, you 
are as much at ease as an Essex Street 
pickle peddler at a Holy Name con- 
vention. If you know French, you find 
that the natives speak Creole, a patois 
that would be pre-Sanskrit to a Pa- 
risian. Somehow you cull your goods 
into a capacious taxi, and are whirled 
through streets that intermittently 
understudy Paradise. The impressive 
pagoda-like iron market, the Dartig- 
nave gendarmerie barracks, the resplen- 
dant palace of government, where the 
president lives, the lifting combers of 
hills parapetted with pillared resi- 
dences, the exquisite tropical flowering, 
these hint an Eden which constant vast 
advertisements of Rhum Barbancourt 
promise to more than gratify. 

“Before the Americans come,” fre- 
quent Marine officers assure you, “the 
natives lived in nothing but shacks.

tured Haitian gestured urbanely to his 
own walls, more than seventy-five years 
old: “You call this a shack, madame?” 

All of the buildings mentioned, ex- 
cept the palace, were completed long 
before 1915; the great house of gov- 
ernment was designed by a Haitian 
architect, and the money for its erec- 
tion entirely appropriated, before the 
Marines landed. 

The morning after our arrival was a 
Sunday, and we were strongly urged to 
attend high mass at the Cathedral, 
for the president would be there. At 
7:50 we reached the vast ungainly 
building. At 8:00 it was occupied by 
the military forces, led by Major Best, 
the intelligent American chief of 
police; Captain Shaker, efficient Ameri- 
can assistant chief of police; two other 
American officers; Haitian Sergeant 
Guerrier, of the bureau of police; Post- 
master General Andrew Chevalier; 
and chief of detectives Bonté, a shrewd 
French employe of the Uplift. At 
8:10 the company of gendarmes, who 
mount guard at the palace, were drawn 
up in battle array around the plaza of 
the Cathedral, reaching to the grand 
entrance. The gendarmerie band, led 
by an American marine captain whose 
service stretched back to the chase after 
Aguinaldo, took its place, and blared 
out military marches. At 8:25 Presi- 
dent and Mrs. Borno arrived, escorted 
by two more American officers. De- 
tectives were scattered throughout the 
church, the Commissioner of Govern- 
ment, accompanied by armed gend- 
armes, taking his place in the gallery.® 

It is always so when President Borno 
attends mass. His sayings are reiterated 
among Marines and __ nationalists 
equally; especially, to the American 
generals of Marines, “Gentlemen, if 
the Occupation is withdrawn, I go on 
the same boat”; and, to the same of- 
ficials, “Gentlemen, if you move the 
marine barracks from the rear of my 
palace out to the aviation field, I move 
the palace along with you.” 

This was our first glimpse of the 
Uplift in action.

E had the entré to the national- 
ists; we met the Occupation and 
Uplift officials quite as promptly. It 
will not be violating a state secret to 
leak that this was facilitated by our 
prompt visits to the principal bars. 
The agreeable American consul, the 
American chief of staff at the Haitian 
General Hospital, the friendly Ameri- 
can provost marshal, countless Ameri- 
can Everything-Elses, insisted that we 
sample the island’s liquid lightning on

them; and all lifted the national Oc- 
cupation and Uplift anthem, “Let me 
give you a card to the American Club. 
You know, no natives are allowed...” 

The background for this was fur- 
nished by the nationalists. When the 
Marines landed, in 1915, to simmer 
down the island’s irritated political 
situation, the cultured natives, dazed 
by presidenticides and dazzled by 
American uniforms, welcomed the uni- 
formed foreigners, and _ entertained 
them imperially at the Bellevue Club, 
the Port-au-Princian, the Marianna 
Club. The white officers accepted the 
entertainment graciously. Then the 
wives of the white officers came; and 
they at once showed a disinclination to 
treat the natives as social equals. 

In 1803, less than a million Haitians, 
in a land without a school, officered by 
turncoat Negroes who had learned 
bloodshed and treachery from the 
French butchers, defeated, by the aid 
of tropical fevers, the finest army in 
the world: Napoleon’s veterans, who 
had trampled Europe.t* For a hun- 
dred and twelve years these Negroes, 
bullied by the white world, throve, 
educated their leaders magnificently, 
educated their peasants passably; and, 
for all of their sanguine backslidings, 
produced no Weyler, no von Plehve, 
no lynchings, pogroms, imperialism, 
vellow journalism, nor fundamental- 
ists. They had no inferiority com- 
plex; they were willing in the end to 
stretch a point, and accept Nordics as 
social equals. 

When the Occupation & Uplift 
formed the American Club, from 
which men of colored blood were ex- 
cluded, the natives decided that no 
American in uniform could hencefor- 
ward attend any of their clubs. Thus 
the first function of the Occupation 
& Uplift has been fulfilled: it has in- 
troduced race prejudice into the 


scorched island Eden.

E did not attend the American 

Club, in spite of our guest 
cards. The non-governmental Ameri- 
cans in Port-au-Prince dissuaded us. 
The nightly gatherings, the Saturday 
evening dances, were said by them to 
be drunken petting parties, marked by 
bitter bickerings. We prefer to dis- 
criminate. 

Yet we saw the members of the club, 
an illuminated Great White Way, 
hegiraing from office to bar, and then 
to bar again, the length of the island. 
Higher than the rank of Marine cap- 
tain, we saw no American official in- 
toxicated ; but, from captain down, the 
humidity was remarkable. In one

gathering, in a captain’s house, the host 
and his wife both tried for an hour to 
tell us the story of the Irishman, the 
pope, and the lumbago; they could not, 
by cooperation and outside assistance, 
reconstruct the point. It took us ten 
days to trace down the story; and then, 
we had to get it from a civilian. 

To generalize broadly, half of the 
American officers ranking from captain 
down are drunk more than half of the 
time. Cocktail parties—we sat in o 
some of these, and were told admir- 
ingly of others—would begin in the 
morning, about eleven, and last until 
the next dawn: bars, the Club, homes, 
joyrides ending in smashups, all in the 
picture. These officers had nothing 
else to do: the white devil finds work 
for idle thirsts and bodies to do. 

The navy and Marine enlisted men, 
as a rule, behave better; they are re- 
quired to. But occasionally squads of 
inebriated navy men on shore leave 
have rioted through Port-au-Prince and 
other towns. Recently a group rough- 
housed a saloon owned by a woman, 
throwing her out of the place, and 
drinking up or smashing, without re- 
imbursement, all of her stock. A gob, 
insultingly drunk, caroused down a 
main street, bumping into many of the 
Haitians. He was stabbed in a re- 
sultant fracas; and when a bystander 
was indicted for this, and was freed 
by a Haitian jury, its two cultured 
members were financially boycotted by 
the Occupation & Uplift. This was 
denied by a number of American of- 
ficers; but we observed that the hotel 
and bar of one of these jurymen, per- 
haps the best restaurant on the island, 
was never patronized by a member of 
the American governmental and Oc- 
cupation forces. 


E visited the three native clubs 
repeatedly ; we saw no one even 
mildly intoxicated, except a civilian 
American, who was pleasantly happy 
on sweet champagne at the Marianna, 
during the Mi Careme dance. We 
dined repeatedly with the Haitian na- 
tionalists, with the most elaborate wine 
courses we beVolsteaded infants had 
ever encountered; neither hosts nor 
guests were even mildly affected. 
Thus, to the uplift by race preju- 
dice, we add the uplift by example: 
the super-imposed ideal of the souse.

HE closing, in Memphis, of the 

largest Negro bank in the South 
is an extraordinary occurrence. It 
marks a new species of racial align- 
ment, and a fight between black and 
white in the economic field which 
never before has been quite so clearly 
indicated. 

There are in the United States per- 
haps fifty small Negro banks. Two 
of these are National banks and the 
rest State institutions. Only four of 
them have resources of more than a 
million dollars, and all of them com- 
bined report total resources of some- 
thing under twenty million. They 
have about three million dollars in 
capital, and $15,000,000 on deposit. 
They correspond to the small country 
white banks. Nevertheless, they are 
of great significance because they rep- 
resent the attempt of Negro Ameri- 
cans to organize their own credit facil- 
ities. They have, on the whole, been 
successful. In the history of Negro 
banking there have been many fail- 
ures, including a few large ones, but 
many of the present banks have been 
in business 10 to 20 years. 

Nevertheless, the whole Negro bank- 
ing business is still on a precarious 
foundation ; on the one hand, the banks 
have not attracted more than one-tenth 
of the funds which American Negroes 
have in banks, and secondly, their fail- 
ure to do this is because the white 
credit system of the country cannot be 
depended upon always to stand back 
of them. In fact, as in Memphis, it 
sometimes is willing to overthrow a 
particular bank. And this is the story 
of the Memphis situation. 


ARLY in October, 1927, with the 

advice and consent of the Bank- 
ing Department of the State of Ten- 
nessee, two colored institutions, the 
Solvent Savings Bank and Trust Com- 
pany and the Fraternal Savings Bank 
and Trust Company, with combined 
resources of $1,300,000 were merged. 
The Solvent Bank was the older bank. 
It was founded in 1906 and had had 
a long, difficult but successful career. 
In the very first year of its operation, 
its colored cashier stole Five Thou- 
sand Dollars; but colored bondsmen 
made restitution and the bank lost 
nothing. A new cashier was brought 
in, a young and able graduate of At- 
lanta University, and business grew 
steadily. In the panic of 1907, the 
bank paid all demands without re- 
sorting to the Clearing House certi- 
ficates which other Memphis banks 


154 


Black Banks and White in Memphis 


By W. E. BURGHARDT Du BOIS 


were using; and it had in 1926 re- 
sources of $1,032,000. The Fraternal 
Bank was founded in 1910 and repre- 
sented a more popular effort working 
on small resources. 


In the last twenty years the whole 
banking situation in Memphis has gone 
through some extraordinary vicissi- 
tudes. More than twenty banks oper- 
ated by white men have either failed 
or been absorbed. The Memphis Sav- 
ings Bank failed in 1906; a little later 
the Mechanics Savings Bank; then 
the United Savings Bank; the All 
Night and Day Bank; and the old 
Chickasaw Bank. Thousands of white 
and black citizens lost money in these 
failures and especially in that of the 
Continental Savings Bank whose head 
committed suicide; in 1914, the Mer- 
cantile Bank failed, where the colored 
Solvent Savings Bank had $20,000 on 
deposit and through which it cleared 
its checks. The head of this bank was 
one of the most popular men in Mem- 
phis and had lost millions in cotton 
speculation. No jury would convict 
him until five years after his defalca- 
tion and after he had been convicted 
of a Federal offense. He was even- 
tually pardoned. The Solvent Bank 
was only partially reimbursed for its 
losses. During the past two years, the 
Germania Savings Bank closed its 
doors and its cashier committed suicide. 


LL these storms the Solvent and 

the Fraternal weathered. When 
the two banks came to be merged, 
there was absolutely no doubt of the 
solvency and efficiency of the Solvent 
Bank. It appears, however, from 
facts now at hand, that the officers of 
the Fraternal Bank were short at the 
time of the merger and had been short 
or impaired for a number of years, 
but by some means had kept the Frat- 
ernal opened. It is generally believed 
that Ward, the President of the Frat- 
ernal, had some powerful ally of the 
white race, whose influence with the 
examiners was enough to allow this 
practically defunct institution to re- 
main open and merge with the sol- 
vent Solvent Bank. The merger was 
not only made at the recommendation 
of the bank examiners, but they espe- 
cially urged that Ward be made Presi- 
dent of the consolidated banks. It 
looked as though the purpose of the 
merger was to give the defaulters a 
chance to cover their defalcations. 
Ward and his assisting officers took 
charge of the consolidated institutions 
and immediately dismissed all of the 





principal officials of the Solvent Bank. 
Despite some rumors, the new con- 
solidated bank began to prosper and 
increase its deposits. 


EANTIME, however, a bitter 
feeling against colored Memphis 
had arisen on account of the political 
activities of Negroes. “Lily white” 
Republicans had been beaten by Ne- 
groes in the naming of the new post- 
master. The Negroes had registered 
in large numbers, some as Republicans 
and some in the Democratic “white” 
primary, and voted. R. R. Chiirch, 
representing a second generation of po- 
litical leadership among Memphis Ne- 
groes, and one of the original found- 
ers of the Solvent Savings Bank, had 
formed a league and made demands on 
the mayor who was a candidate for 
reelection. The mayor replied: 
“There is no use in mincing words 
about the matter, and my answer to 
the demands of this Negro political 
league is the direct and positive state- 
ment that there will be no Negro po- 
licemen, no Negro firemen, nor re- 
moval of the restrictions now govern- 
ing the admission of Negroes to the 
white parks of the city, including the 
Overton Park zoo, as long as I have 
any voice in the control of the city 
government.” - 
The mayor was defeated. 


Thus the Klan elements were bit- 
ter against Church, and although 
Church had long ceased to have any 
official connection with the Solvent 
Savings Bank, still the bank was as- 
sociated with his name, and it seems 
probable that certain elements in Mem- 
phis determined to strike at the Ne- 
groes through the bank. The Chair- 
man of the Board of Directors of the 
bank had once been candidate for Con- 
gress in Shelby County and other di- 
rectors and depositors had been active 
in political self-assertion and indepen- 
dence on the part of the Negro. 


EN days before Christmas, white 

business men on Main Street re- 
fused to take from colored customers 
the Christmas checks issued by the 
consolidated Negro bank. Immedi- 
ately, it became known that the Sat- 
urday before Christmas the bank ex- 
aminers had visited the bank and or- 
dered $25,000 cash to be raised be- 
fore the bank could be opened the 
Tuesday after Christmas. The white

WO alternate tours to Califor- 
nia are being offered delegates 
and visitors to the Annual 

Spring Conference of the N. A. A. 
C. P. in Los Angeles, June 27 to July 
3. One of these tours is being ar- 
ranged under the auspices of the Na- 
tional Office and offers the quickest 
and lowest-fare tour to Los Angeles 
and return, by special train leaving 
New York June 21 and Chicago, June 
22, which may be joined by those 
starting from other Eastern, Southern 
and Mid-Western points. This tour 
is designed for those who wish to go 
to Los Angeles at minimum expense 
and as quickly as possible. It pro- 
vides that those who want to return in 
the same way can do so, though they 
may arrange for whatever tours they 
wish after the Conference, coming 
home through the parks and moun- 
tains of the Far West. 


HE second tour offered delegates 

and visitors to the Los Angeles 
Conference, is an all-expense trip or- 
ganized by the W. Hayes McKinney, 
heading a Committee of the Detroit 
Branch, N. A. A. C. P. This tour 
leaves Chicago by special train on June 
21 and provides for stop-overs in Den- 
ver, Colorado Springs, Salt Lake City, 
Los Angeles during the Conference, 
San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, and 
Victoria, returning East via the Cana- 
dian Northwest on the Canadian Pa- 
cific Railroad. 

The cost of this tour will include all 
items except meals and living expenses 
in Los Angeles during the Conference. 
Those wishing to take this elaborate 
and comprehensive tour of the Far 
West, can obtain full details by writ- 
ing Mr. W. Hays McKinney at 1911 
St. Antoine Street, Detroit, Michigan. 
Those wishing to travel at minimum 
expense, without stopovers on the way 
to Los Angeles may make reservations 
on the special train leaving New York 
June 21, by writing to the National 
Office of the N. A. A. C. P., 69 Fifth 
Avenue, New York City. Any who

friends. It is important that plans be 
made as early as possible. For in order 
to take advantage of the reduced ex- 
cursion rates offered in summer by the 
railroads, travellers must decide on 
both the outgoing and homecoming 
routes before they purchase their 
round-trip tickets. Any combination is 
possible. You may go out on one rail- 
road line and come back on any other. 

Agents of the Rock Island and the 
New York Central lines throughout 
the country have been instructed to 
give visitors and delegates to the Los 
Angeles Conference all possible assist- 
ance. They will inform you at what 
points and when you can join the Na- 
tional Office or the Detroit Branch 
special trains to Los Angeles. They 
will help you arrange vacation tours in 
the Far West after the Conference if 
you so desire. And they will give all 
necessary information concerning 
routes, train service, fares and inciden- 
tal expenses. 


FAIR PLAY 

OTHING is more striking about 

race relations in America than 
the violent contrasts that they afford. 
The N. A. A. C. P. had recently op- 
portunity to call to the attention of 
colored editors throughout the country 
that on a single Sunday in the three 
leading daily newspapers of New York 
City, Negroes had been featured as 
writers, actors, reviewers of books and 
artists, on exactly the same terms as 
white people and without any taint of 
condescension. 

In its drama section the New York 
Times published a picture of Miller 
and Lyles in their musical comedy 
“Keep Shufflin.’”” The World had a 
large portrait head of Paul Robeson 
who had recently joined the cast of 
Porgy, the play with an all-colored 
cast but for one white actor; and in its 
color gravure section there was an il- 
lustration taken from a scene of this 
play. The Times, World and Herald- 
Tribune on that same Sunday, in their 
literary sections, all had laudatory re- 
views of Claude McKay’s novel, 
“Home To Harlem”, and the Trib- 
une’s review was written by a young 
colored writer, Gwendolyn B. Bennett ; 
another review in the Herald-Trib- 
une’s literary section being written by 
the colored novelist, Eric Walrond. 


3C_®® 


T about the time the N. A. A. 
C. P. was able to broadcast this 
good news to colored editors through- 
out the country, it was having to cail 
attention to the cold-blooded murder 
in Miami, several years ago by police 
officers, of a colored bell-boy, a lynch- 
ing by officers of the law just brought 
to light by court proceedings. As the 
N. A. A. C. P. remarked in its letters 
to the white press calling attention 
to this outrage, there was no question 
of an “inflamed mob” or of a fugitive 
from justice. The police officers wan- 
tonly and brutally murdered a helpless 
voung colored man in their custody. 
Their doing so was symptomatic of the 
state of feeling on race relations preva- 
lent in Florida—Florida second only to 
Mississippi in its disgraceful lynching 
record for the past forty years. 
Needless to say, the daily newspapers 
of Florida do not publish articles by 
Negro reviewers. They do not fea- 
ture the portraits of Negro actors, 
singers-and artists. If they mention 
the achievements of the Negro at all, 
it is because the Negro has been given 
opportunity to do his best work and to 
give himself freely in the North. 


HE two items of news, almost sim- 
ultaneous, one coming from New 
York City, the other from Miami, 
Florida, emphasize the part played by 
a state of mind on race relations. Peo- 
ple say that the problems of race rela- 
tions become severer as the Negro 
population increases. But there are 
probably more Negroes in New York 
City than in any equivalent area any- 
where in the world. And nowhere is 
the Negro given greater opportunity 
to demonstrate his abilities than in 
New York City. 

So it is not the number of Negroes 
in Florida or in Mississippi that brings 
about the outrages of lynching and pe- 
onage, the denial of educational oppor- 
tunity and the oppression that poison 
race relations. It is a state of mind, 
and a state of mind chiefly among the 
white people. The white people will 
have the kind of colored neighbors that 
they permit to grow in their midst. 

And meanwhile, in the news from 
New York City on one Sunday, and in 
the news from Miami, Florida, the N. 
A. A. C. P. sees good reason for con- 
tinuing its unremitting efforts to wake 
the South to realization of public de- 
cency, its responsibility to black and 
white citizens alike, and the determina-

How Much Insurance Should You Have? | 


ANY men drift into the insur- 

ance which they have without 
any thought as to the amount or the 
kind of policies they should carry. 
Usually each individual buys what- 
ever policy, both in kind and amount, 
that the agent sells. If the agent picks 
out a particular kind of policy and 
talks about that to the exclusion of 
everything else he sells that policy. 

That is one reason why so many 
of our folks have Endowment policies 
today. They have been taught by the 
agents of certain large white com- 
panies that an Endowment policy is 
the best thing for them to have. And 
they do not believe a Race agent when 
he tells them differently. The result 
is that our people pay more for life 
insurance and get less than any other 
group in America. 

The bulk of the insurance which 
they carry is on the industrial plan, 
which is the highest priced insurance 
in the world. The only thing to be 
said for industrial insurance is that 
it does enable the majority of our peo- 
ple to carry enough insurance almost 
to pay their funeral expenses. But 
in these days of high-priced funerals 
it takes a good deal more insurance 
than even 25 cents a week will buy to 
finish up the doctor’s bill and then pay 
the undertaker. So that many of our 
folks who bought industrial policies 
years ago and have paid their five, ten, 
or twenty-five cents a week regularly 
for years have bought on a falling 
market and the purchasing power of 
their dollar is worth much less today 
than when they started. 


HE same thing is true of the man 

who fifteen years ago bought 
$1,000 of insurance and thought he 
was adequately insured. At that time 
it was perhaps close to his earnings 
for a year. But today, it is another 
story. We must therefore revise our 
insurance program along with our in- 
come and the cost of living as it 
changes year by year. 

It is now generally accepted that 
there are five standards of living pos- 
sible for the United States: 

1. Minimum Standard $1,200- 
$1,500 a year. 

2. Comfortable Standard $1,800- 
$2,200 a year. 

3. Moderate 
$5,000 a year. 

4. Liberal Standard $6,000-$20,- 
000 a year. 

5. Super-Liberal Standard $25,000 
or more a year. 

Judged by these standards, the over- 


156 


Standard $2,500- 


By HARRY H. PACE 


whelming majority of our folks are 
still in the Minimum Standard class, 
or even lower. An increasingly large 
number are in the Comfortable Stand- 
ard. And a smaller, but increasing 
number are in the Moderate Standard. 
Scattered all over the country are a 
small group in almost every large 
community who can qualify in the 
Liberal Standard of Living Class. But 
a precious few anywhere in the Class 


aBove. 


HE great tragedy of the upper 

classes is that they are not per- 
petuating these incomes. Most of our 
incomes even in these upper classes, 
are not from the returns on fortunes 
previously invested either in real estate 
or stocks and bonds; but they are the 
immediate return of some professional 
or business activity. And with the 
death of the husband or father as the 
case may be, the entire income ceases. 
It has become almost axiomatic that 
“there are many rich Negroes alive, 
but no rich Negroes dead”. 

Life insurance is the surest and 
quickest way to change this condition. 
It is the method that the most astute 
business brain of America has adopted 
both to create large estates, assuring 
an exactly calculable income *o their 
dependents, and to conserve and pro- 
tect estates already created. One can 
figure out how much certain income 
he would like to leave his dependents 
and if he is able to do so he need only 
pay during his lifetime about 314% 
to 4% on the principal necessary to 
produce such an income and then be 
assured that his dependents will never 
want. And it can be arranged so that 
never really means never. You can 
pick out the Standard in which you 
want your dependents to live and as- 
sure them of that Standard. 

Colored people must begin in larger 
numbers to adopt this method. Un- 
fortunately for us as a race, we see 
and quickly imitate all the white man’s 
vices, but we neither have the oppor- 
tunity to see so much of his virtues, 
nor do we imitate them so readily. 
“Life insurance among Negroes is so 
small as to be almost negligible,” so 
said the Spectator Magazine once. 
And until we change that condition 
our economic condition in this country 
will also be negligible as compared 
with other groups. 


O embark on such a program as 
suggested above we must think 
in terms of insurance above the indus- 
trial and above the _ intermediate 


grades. We must think of life jp. 
surance in its original sense of pure 
protection, devoid of all the frills that 
have subsequently come to it, and with 
a view to getting as much of it as pos- 
sible for the money which we pay. 

Now let us see something about 
costs. Taking the figures of the lary- 
est industrial insurance company in 
the world we find that a man age 35, 
who pays 25 cents a week can get an 
Endowment policy of $200 payable at 
the end of 20 years or at prior death, 
Or he can get a Whole Life policy of 
$345 which is payable at death. This 
premium of 25 cents a week, amnount- 
ing to $13.00 a year, must be paid 
continuously. If he misses + weeks 
payment his policy lapses and he is out 
of benefits. There are no cash sur- 
render or loan values until after the 
tenth year and if he pays for 9 years 
and quits, he has had the protection 
for which he paid at a high rate and 
that is all. 

This same man could, if he paid 


annually get a $500 Whole Life pol- 


‘icy for $13.88—just .88 cents more 


per year, for which he would receive 
$155 more of insurance. Or he could 
get a $500 Endowment policy for 
$24.10 a year, making the additional 
$300 of insurance cost him only $11.10 
per year. These policies have cash 
surrender values at the end of 3 years 
and may be borrowed upon at any 
time after 3 years to the extent of 
about one-third of the premiums paid. 

Or if he is farther up in the scale 
of income, this same man, at age 35, 
can obtain from one of our own com- 
panies $1,000 of insurance for $28.45, 
or $655 more of insurance for just 
$15.45 a year more than he is paying 
at the rate of 25 cents a week. 

If he is still higher up in the income 
scale and wants to protect himself as 
much as he can for as small an amount 
as possible he can buy $5,000 of Whole 
Life insurance for $130.00 a year. For 
just 10 times the amount the indus- 
trial man pays this man can get nearly 
15 times as much protection, with all 
the features of cash surrender, loan, 
and extended insurance values. 


OW how large a part of one’s 

income should be put into life 
insurance. The general answer is put 
every dollar you can. But to enable 
one to reach some intelligent conclu- 
sion let us take some figures and try 
to Budget them. Here is a pretty 
good general budget for the average

HEN the fields are all fresh and 
sweet with the spring then the 
lark sings. A May day! Here is the 
new wheat that has been coming up 
through the snow. You are gazing at 
its refreshing bluish green blades when 
there sounds a breezy whistling from 
an unseen bird. But oh! you know it 
is the meadowlark. Its song is so airy. 
You look for the lark then finally 
find him at the edge of the field. Some- 
where off in the pleasant maze of 
wheat Mother Meadowlark is busy 
with her young. When the farmers 
are ready to cut the wheat these bird- 
lings will be able to care for them- 
selves, if meadow mice spare them. 

One always feels sorry for birds 
reared on the ground. Once I came 
upon some poor little ugly gray doves 
that looked as though they were fash- 
ioned from old gray rubber overshoes. 
Lying flat on a bald spot in a pasture 
they looked more like “ugly duck- 
lings” than doves. 

The doves cooing their sad little 
songs in May when other birds are 
singing joyously used to awake my 
sympathy. But upon finding Mother 
Dove’s nests carelessly set here and 
there where cats could get them with 
ease, I would feel vexed at dove stu- 
pidity. Then the way that they were 
flung together !—a chip here, a coarse 
bit of brush there, unhomelike, cheer- 
less looking, yet one could not cherish 
ill feelings toward such gentle crea- 
tures as doves. 


Ooze of Frog, Musk of Muskrat,

LL the kobolds in a party of six 

booked to ride on Cress Lake 
were aboard but one and were sailing 
away on the Twilight Trip. The miss- 
ing kobold was Acorn Cap. And he 
was not there BECAUSE ! 

He had been terrible. Instead of 
resting in the afternoon as all sane 
elves are expected to do that they may 
be refreshed and ready for moonlight 
rambles Acorn had meddled with af- 
fairs of the household in which he lived 
as cupboard crevice neighbor to 
Antique the prim cricket that baked 
humble pies all winter and sold them 
in the summer time when the millet 
was ripe. Antique was quite a dif- 
ferent creature from the mischievous 
kobold. 

The cook in preparing dinner had 
dropped some peas on the kitchen floor. 





May, 1928 


The Little Page 


By EFFIE LEE NEWSOME 





And Acorn had attached invisible 
strings to these to keep rolling them 
up and down the linoleum to the dis- 
gust of the cook and the butler, 
Jacket, who actually got to quarrel- 
ing over them. Acorn watching from 
Antique’s winter home chuckled as only 


pixies and kobolds can. Inside the 
noise suggests a mouse squeak. Out- 
side it is like the “tweak” of a bat. 

But Acorn frolicked so long that 
when his friends were ready for their 
evening pleasures he lay exhausted in 
the cricket’s cubbyhole. Suddenly in 
dreaming he seemed to catch the pip- 
ing of a tiny boat whistle. Up sprang 
Acorn Cap. Yes! It was the Twi- 
light Trip starting on its outing for 
water cress. 


OOR ACORN CAP jumped out 

of his hole, climbed to a window 
in the buttery, kicked an opening in 
the screen and plunged through down- 
ward to the dripping grass. Off he 
rushed. But when he reached Cress 
Lake the bat wing sails of the Twi- 
light Trip were full spread and she 
was speeding away. 

“What in the world is your 
trouble?” croaked Stile Legs, a frog 
that sat by the lake. 

“If you'd ever tried to catch a boat 
and been able to catch only a glimpse 
instead you could understand,” panted 
Acorn Cap. 

“No need to be tart. When one 
misses a boat it is seldom the boat’s 
fault. But get on my back, pixie. I 
don’t mind taking you across to your 
ship. I thought you little creatures 
could swim and do everything else.” 


“Thanks so much.” Acorn Cap 
sprang to the bronze back of Stile Legs 
and the voyage began. 

Out and out, out and out went the 
long hind legs of the frog. Acorn’s 
heart bounded. They were approach- 
ing the Twilight Trip and he could 
see its passengers bent over the ship 
side and seining cress as they leisurely 
floated. 

“I wonder why you missed your 
party,” speculated Stile Legs as they 
passed a muskrat lodge. I thought 
kobolds were punctual. I knew one 
who actually lived with a nervous little 
wooden cuckoo just for the sake of 
being on time, and kept house in a 
clock chalet.” 


66 ELL, I would have been here 
earlier,’ Acorn began as 
Stile Legs sped on, “but 2 

“Never mind, interrupted Stile Legs 
now growing weary of his passenger. 
“‘Lateness is lateness. No fence around 
it.” And with an impatient twitch he 
shoved Acorn Cap from his slimy 
shoulders to the back of a muskrat that 
was emerging from a starwort tangle. 

“Sorry,” soon murmured Placid the 
muskrat, “but I turn in here at this 
cave. ’Fraid the hawks and owls will 
steal my babies.” 

“Don’t take me into all that chok- 
ing stuff,” cried Acorn Cap. “My 
party’s in the middle of the stream.” 

“Sorry again,” Placid breathed. 
“This is home.” And she gently shook 
Acorn Cap from her back to the roots 
of a water willow in order that he 
might climb up to land. 

The shrill whistle of the Twilight 
Trip sounded again. 

“So far away,” Acorn Cap thought 
as he gazed sorrowfully toward the 
speck on the water. And he dropped, 
sobbing, to the willow roots. 

“Hoot, hoot, hoot! Get up from 
there at once,” cried a voice from the 
old willow tree. “I’m Brown Bar the 
owl. I heard that sly muskrat talk- 
ing about my stealing her babies. But 
I’ll show you I have a better heart than 
she.” And down flew Brown Bar. 





E made Acorn Cap mount him, 
and flying out to the Twilight 
dropped the elf on the net of cress. 
“There!” 
“Haul me up,” cried delighted 
Acorn Cap. “I’m a passenger.” 
Captain Float turned his glasses 
sternly upon him from the Twilight 
Trip and stared down. “Passenger?”

City Streets 
By MICHAEL FRAENKEL 


LL day long 
people came in and out of me— 
clean people, well-groomed gentlemen 
with polished canes, 
dirty people with the stink 
of their trades on their hands, 
and clothes, and hairy bodies. 
And women with high heels, 
and furs over their necks, 
and insolently smooth skins, 
and proud, well-reared buttocks, 
and prostitutes with their castrate leers 
lurking from the glossy corners of their 
eyes, . 
and the greasy public smell all over 
them: 
all day long they walked, 
and beat down upon my heart, 
my brain, into my blood, 
so that now I have to take them 
all to bed with me, 
my body, all of me, 
a city of beaten streets of feet.

A new order of Negro Youth, eager 

For the quest of the Guarded Heights,

To mock; but steadfast above 

All pettiness, you shall stand.

From baseness to nobility. 

Dip your gilt-edged pen in the well-

Of your heart. With swift agility, 

Fling word on word to pierce and sting 

As the rapier thrust, men’s hearts. 

Your daring pen shall slowly lessen 

Studied, insidious plots 

Of prejudice and inhuman oppression. 

Open the flood-gate of your vivid soul. 

On crested waves of creative 

Genius, unveiled beauty shall roll 

Forth, to transform, to give 

New life to barren canvass. Men 

Shall gaze astounded and their 

Eager hands shall reach out then, 

Not to despoil, but to share, 

To possess the lofty inspiration 

Pure art alone can give. 


“N EW NEGRO, in this -generation 

You shall fully live. 

“The old order changeth’. Not 

Mold of face, nor color of skin 

Shall conquer the cruel heart 

Of race tyranny, or bigotry, its kin. 

They shall perish by your flashing sword 

Of ability. Your shield, brightly 

Emblazoned with fine achievement, shall 
afford 

Invulnerable armor for unsightly 

Barbs of asinine abuse. Knights 

Of the order of New Negro Youth, 

You shall reach the Guarded Heights 

With weapons of integrity and truth.”

duce a fund, the income of which is to 
be used for scholarships for worthy 
students. Dr. Johnson has spent his 
life in work under the direction of the 
Board of Home Missions of the United 
Presbyterian Church. His activities 
have been confined chiefly to the 
schools planted and maintained by the 
United Presbyterian Church in the 
southwestern part of Alabama. Dr. 
Johnson has keen business ability and 
with careful saving and wise invest- 
ment he has been able to accumulate 
this property which he now deeds to 
Knoxville College. 

@ St. Luke Brown, the colored Hamp- 
ton student, who was arrested for 
striking a white teacher, was given

Crisis 





“Spring is come!” 


@ For the first time Negroes have 
been given a prominent place on the 
program of the Georgia State Confer- 
ence for Social Work. The Confer- 
ence met in Columbus, Georgia. The 
program announced: “A discussion of 
the special problems and especial handi- 
caps which face persons doing social 
work of all kinds among Negroes in 
Georgia. The presentation, however, 
will not emphasize the problems and 
handicaps per se, but rather the way 
in which they are being met by some 
workers, or by some communities.” 

@ William Pickens reports that in a 
little less than four years, colored 
babies, assisted by a few grown-ups in 
the United States, have raised $51,506 
for the work of the National Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People. He calls this the Tenth Cru- 
sade, following the 9th Crusade, by 
which the late Mary Talbert and her 
co-workers, raised $15,000 to fight 
lynching. 

@ The Association for the Advance- 
ment of Negro Country Life has been 
formed, with Benjamin F. Hubert of 
the Georgia State Industrial College 
as Executive Secretary. 


@ The Supreme Life and Casualty 
Company of Columbus, Ohio has just 
completed and dedicated at Cincinnati 
a branch office building at a cost of 
$75,000. It is on land formerly owned 
by a colored woman; was sold by a col- 
ored real estate dealer, and with the 
exception of a half dozen iron and 
terrazo workers, was entirely built by 
Negro labor. ; 


EDUCATION 


@ The Bethune-Cookman College had 
on its annual All States Day, repre- 
sentatives from thirty-four states, be- 


May, 1928 


sides Canada, Jamaica and England. 


@ The Jeanes Fund for the improve- 
ment of Negro rural schools, co-oper- 
ated with public schcol boards and su- 
perintendents in 306 counties and in 14 
states, during the year ending June 30, 
1927. Three Hundred and Nine Su- 
pervising Teachers made 51,011 visits 
to 9,428 schools and raised for school 
improvement $495,845. They received 
$273,418 in salaries, of which the 
Jeanes Fund paid $108,547. The Fund 
has established 306 teacher training 
schools with 2,161 teachers; 11,810 
pupils in high school grades, who are 
paid $1,104,510 in salaries from the 
the public tax funds, or an average of 
$3,610. To this the Slater Fund and 
the General Education Board has 
added $106,000 and the General Edu- 
cation Board in Education has given 
$64,801 for building and equipment. 


@ John D. Rockefeller, Jr., will de- 


liver the Commencement address at 


The new Cincinnati headquarters of the Supreme Life and Casualty Insurance Company 


Fisk University next June. Julius 
Rosenwald has offered to give $25,000

@ In the Christmas Crisis, 1927, ap- 
peared an article on the South Caro- 
lina Negro Common Schools. It was 
stated there that Avery Institute, on 
account of unfavorable industrial con- 
ditions, had not been able to raise the 
$3,500 which it set out to get for the 
support of the institution. ‘This was a 
mistake. Every cent of the money was 
raised, despite the abundant difficulties.

the Board is coooperating with state

normal schools and agricultural and 
mechanical colleges, and in procuring 
better training for especially zifted or 
promising teachers; it is cooperating 
with the Jeanes and Slater Funds in 
accomplishing the objects for which 
those foundations were created. In 
addition to these efforts which touch 
public education, the Board is also as- 
sisting colleges, universities, and medi- 
cal schoois. 

During the year 1926-27, its appro- 
priations for these purposes were as 
follows:

the field of Negro education may, it 
seems probable, be advantageously re- 
organized. ‘The officers are engaged in 
a careful survey of the subject in the 
hope of discovering the most effective 
method of concentrating the Board’s 
work.

English Commission visiting East 
Africa. It expresses alarm that non- 
official Europeans are to have mre 
voice in the Government, since “in the 
past, whenever the unofficial European 
had his way, he has shown a decided 
tendency in the direction of usurping 
the natives’ land, reducing him tu the 
position of a wage-earner and restrict- 
ing him in movements and opportuni- 
ties’. They ask that the “huge

ORAN  betore merging with 

Doubleday published two inter- 
esting books—Sherwood Eddy’s “Re- 
ligion and Social Justice and Kirby 
Page’s “Dollars and World Peace”. 
Neither of these authors realize the 
rdle that race prejudice plays in war 
and social insult but they are earnest 
students of other important factors. 
Page says: 

“In many of its aspects the present 
foreign policy of this country is men- 
acing to the peace of the world. We 
are alienating millions of people in 
Europe, Latin America and Asia. On 
both sides the Atlantic and Pacific 
angry passions are being aroused. It 
is imperative, therefore, that a more 
constructive foreign policy be adopted 
without delay.” 

Sherwood Eddy, who was disposed 
to dodge race difficulties before the 
war, says that: 

“With the war religion began to 
dawn upon me as a social experience. 
.... There broke upon me the first 
gleams of social gospel that sought not 
only to save individuals for the future, 
but here and now in this world of bit- 
ter need to christianize the whole of 
life and all its relationships—indus- 
trial, social, sexual, racial, interna- 
tional. Religion was not primarily 
something to be believed, or felt; it was 
something to be done, a life to be lived, 
a principle and a program to be in- 
carnated in character and built into a 
social order. This social.gospel added 
a new dimension to my life, it raised it 
to a higher power.” 

The books sell at $1.50 each. 

“Ebony and Topaz’, a “Collect- 
anea” edited by C. S. Johnson and 
published by the Urban League con- 
tains so much work and of such un- 
even quality, that it is difficult to judge 
or characterize it. It is a sort of big 
scrap book, quite without unity, even 
of race, and containing stories, poems, 
essays, plays, translations, biographies, 
reprints, drawings, etc. Some bits are 
lovely, some mediocre and others make 
any judgment doubtful. If the whole 
thing had been split up into a half 
dozen little booklets, each with its ar- 
tistic unity and clear spiritual message, 
the net result would surely have been 
greater and more valuable. 

“Stalin’s Interview with the First 
American Trade Union Delegation to 
Soviet Russia” (Workers Library No. 

has some clean, straight questions 
and answers. For instance: 


May, 1928 


THE BROWSING READER | 











“Question II. Is it accurate to say 
that the Communist Party controls the 
Russian Government? 

Reply: It all depends upon what is 
meant by control. In capitalist coun- 
tries they have a rather curious con- 
ception of control. I know that a num- 
ber of capitalist governments are con- 
trolled by big banks, notwithstanding 
the existence of “democratic” parlia- 
ments. The parliaments assert that 
they alone control the government. As 
a*matter of fact, the composition of 
the governments is predetermined, and 
their actions are controlled by great 
financial consortiums. Who does not 
know that there is not a single capi- 
talist “Power” in which the Cabinet 
can be formed in opposition to the 
will of the big financial magnates? It 
is sufficient to exert financial pressure 
to cause Cabinet Ministers to fall from 
their posts as if they were stunned. 
This is real control exercised by banks 
over governments in spite of the alleged 
control of parliament. If such control 
is meant, then I must declare that con- 
trol of the government by money-bags 
is inconceivable and absolutely ex- 
cluded in the U. S. S. R., if only for 
the reason that the banks have been 
long ago nationalized and the money- 
bags have been ousted. Perhaps the 
delegation did not mean control, but 
the guidance exercised by the Party in 
relation to the Government. If that is 
what the delegation meant by its ques- 
tion, then my reply is: Yes, our Party 
does guide the Government. And the 
Party is able to guide the Government 
because it enjoys the confidence of the 
majority of the workers and the toilers 
generally and it has the right to guide 
the organs of the Government in the 
name of this majority.”

now to well-equipped schools, 
manned by trained teaching forces. J. 
H. Dillard in Worlds Work for Jan- 
uary explains the evolution of Negro 
colleges from the late ’60’s when they 
were little more than “little red school 
houses”, to the present, when Negro 
youth is so trained as to provide teach- 
ers, not only for primary and secondary 
schools, but also for colleges. 

The same issue of World’s Work 
takes us for “A Visit to Pygmyland”, 
where, Matthew Stirling tells us, New 
Guinea’s black Lilliputians live a 


Utopian existence. “This community, 
hemmed in by snow capped mountains 
whose peaks brush a low hung tropi- 
cal sky, exists in a stone age, totally 
isolated, and utterly ignorant of the 
world. 

Albon L. Holsey says that the “Ne- 
gro in Business is Aided by Racial Ap- 
peal” in Forbes for January 15. 
Emerging from slavery, Negro busi- 
ness took on the vestments of Negro 
occupations prior to emancipation; but 
step by step, the Negro has entered 
almost every known profession. Be- 
tween 1900 and 1910, according to 
Census reports, Negroes made practi- 
cally as much economic progress as 
they had in the thirty-five preceding 
years. 

Howard Snyder explains some of the 
many reasons “Why the Negro is 
Moving North” in Plain Talk for 
March. Mr. Snyder states that one 
of the primary causes of this whole- 
sale migration Northward is the un- 
fairness of the share crop system, which 
keeps the tenants in a continuous state 
of indebtedness. Glowing reports 
from other Negroes who have found 
better working conditions and educa- 
tional advantages in the North also 
play a big part in the history of the 
migration. Mr. Snyder advises the 
South to stop being stupid in her treat- 
ment of Negroes for her own economic 
protection. 

Living Age for April 1 carries 
‘‘Africa’s Growing Pains”, a transla- 
tion of an article by Colin Ross which 
appeared in the Neue Ziiricher Zeitung, 
the Swiss Liberal Republican daily. 
Mr. Ross says that the future of Africa 
is difficult to foretell because it is im- 
possible to estimate the cultural cap- 
abilities of the various Negro peoples 
and to discover how readily they can 
adapt themselves to the restrictions of 
modern states. The achievements of 
Negroes on the Gold Coast and in 
Uganda, he says, defy the popular opin- 
ion that Africans are a stupid lot, un- 
able to simulate the habiliments of 
modern culture. 

In the past there have been two dis- 
tinct periods of leadership in Negro 
America says E. Franklin Frazier in 
discussing “The American Negro’s 
New Leaders” in Current History for 
April. Immediately after emancipa- 
tion Negroes found their leaders in the 
preachers and politicians. Frederick 
Douglass was the chief exponent of

THE FAR HORIZON 


5G 


A SUMMER RESORT 


DOLPH A. GEREAU writes us 
from St. Thomas, Virgin Islands: 


Of the more than twenty-two thousand 
inhabitants of the Virgin Islands of the 
United States there are 90 per cent Ne- 
groes, and 95 per cent of these Negroes 
are citizens of the United States. 
I have been informed by reliable 
persons that the conditions generally ex- 
isting here do not obtain anywhere in 
the United States, in a community of like 
size and importance. Lynching, segre- 
gation and the other evils we read of as 
occurring in the United States are for- 
eign to us. Here Negroes meet Whites 
on equal terms and any discrimination 
that might be observed will be found 
to exist among very, very few Conti- 
nental Americans. About 55 per cent of 
the wealth in Saint Thomas is held and 
owned by Negroes. They are owners of 
real estate and commercial enterprises 
and are found to be adequately educated 
to occupy the positions they hold. How- 
ever, there are certain economic factors 
that are sure to play a very important 
part in placing these Negroes in a less 
favorable position than they at present 
occupy, and these are as follows: Due 
to the scarcity of employment they are 
forced to leave the islands to seek em- 
ployment elsewhere, usually in the 
United States, and chiefly in Harlem. 
Those who have some capital or inter- 
ests here can hold out a. little longer but 
eventually will have to sell out their in- 
terests and leave also. This will cause a 
gradual, but sure, change of wealth, as 
all properties and other interests will be 
bought by White people, thus relieving 
Negroes of their ownership. So eco- 
nomically at least the Colored people are 
dropping to a lower level. 

This can only be prevented by the race 
conscious Colored people of the United 
States taking some measures to assist the 
islands, and thereby maintain the posi- 
tion and prestige now enjoyed here. 

Geographically these islands enjoy an 
enviable position. The salubrious climate 
and scenic splendor of the islands are 
wonderful, but are too little known to 
the American people. The sea beaches 
cannot be equalled any where else, and 
the opportunities for recreation and 
pleasure are ever present. The question 
is: Can the Colored people of America 
build a place where they might enjoy a 
vacation and go to for recreation, where 
they will be happy among American citi- 
zens of their own color, where they will 
meet people as refined as they are who 
will take an interest in them and make 
them happy. Where they will be rid of 
the discriminations, etc., etc., that we 
read of, in the newspapers, as happen- 
ing. While White people will be amus- 
ing themselves at Palm Beach and other 


166 


places in Florida, at Bermuda and other 
places of attraction the Colored people 
could be enjoying the same comforts in 
the Virgin Islands. It is certainly easy 
enough to get to the Virgin Islands. 
The Furness Bermuda and West In- 
dies §. §. Company and the Colombian 
S. S. Company maintain regular sailings 
to the Virgin Islands. The New York 
and Porto Rico S. S. Co. and the Bull- 
Insular Line maintain regular sailings to 
Porto Rico from which place mail steam- 
ers connect with the Virgin Islands twice 
a week. Information can be gotten from 
any of these S$. S. Companies with re- 
gard to sailings, prices and so forth. We 
have telegraph and radio here. We have 
telephone and electric light, automobiles, 
movies and every thing that modern cities 
should have for the comfort of citizens. 
Living is comparatively cheap, at any rate 
much cheaper than in the United States. 
The only trouble is that the American 
Negro does not know of the oportunities 
that are his in the Virgin Islands. 


MILHOLLAND 


RS. JEANNE ROBERT FOS- 
TER read a poem at the unveil- 
ing of the John E. Milholland bust at 


Cheyney. It was in part as follows: 


His was a face that life impressed with 
love, 

With eyes that poured compassion on his 
kind, 

Measuring pity for man’s blackest sin. 

He gave so freely his abundant life 

That we must grow in stature else 
ashamed, 

We cannot meet the level of his eyes. 

No differences of race, condition, kind 

Obscured his vision of the abiding soul, 

Equal and glorious in the sight of 
Heaven. 

Hold this enduring bronze before your 
eyes 

For inspiration and the lofty faith 

He cherished. Do not think of him as 
dead. 

There are no dead, and he who greatly 

lived 

Cannot be less freed to the Eternal Day. 

He lives within our hearts that keep his 
memory; 

He lives forever in the heart of God. 


PULLMAN PORTERS 


ARRY CARR writes in the Los 
Angeles Times: 


The Pullman porters say they are go- 
ing to strike for higher wages and no 
tips. I am for the no-tip part of it. 

There is no reason why these men 
should have to crawl and smirk to a lot 
of wise-cracking hosiery drummers—be 
called “George” and pretend to like it— 
in order to earn their board and keep. 





8 


A porter has a tough, trying job having 
to be patient with people he would like 
to throw off the train, and going without 
sleep. 

I always get a kick out of the mag- 
nificent and regal air with which the 
nobodies on a Pullman train order 
around this temporary servant. You can 
always tell the people who are used to 
giving orders. 


DENTISTS 


YOUNG colored man writes to 
us: . 

An advertisement in THE CrRisis 
reads: “There is an especially great de- 
mand for our dentists”. 

But I know one of these dentists. He 
finished well up in his class. He worked 
hard for that diploma. He is foreign- 
born and black; unattractively black as 
we say in America. He came out of col- 
lege owing money; lots of it, even as 
most of us Owe money: some of it to 
friends whom we lose because we cannot 
pay back within two years as Mr. Rocke- 
feller thinks we might, some of it to loan 
funds, some of it to loan sharks. He 
came out of school two years ago owing 
money and unable to pay the fee for the 
“Board” examination in the State of his 
matriculation. He did not want to bor- 
row more money. He cast about for 
employment. Yes, he tried to sell life 
insurance and got deeper in debt (only 
book-selling is worse). In desperation 
he tried the railroads. Too short for a 
Pullman porter. ‘Too short and too 
black for a waiter. The common assump- 
tion is that a black man gets excited in 
the presence of a white woman quicker 
than a mulatto. The company is not 
hiring very many waiters at present, but 
certainly no black waiters with a for- 
eign accent. “Ever try ‘cooking’?” So 
he hired out as a cook at twenty-six 
cents an hour. A fourth cook, dish- 
washer, potato peeler. Twenty-six cents 
an hour and meals and a chance to sleep 
in the company’s consumptive quarters. 
If he rides in that hot hole for 360 hours 
a month he will earn $93.60. If he buys 
no clothes, permits himself no diversion 
and does not get down with rheumatism 
he ought to be able to save a thousand 
dollars, within a year. Will his health 
hold up under that strain? Who cares? 
He will come out of that hole with his 
best years behind him. He will die too 
soon. 

“There is an especially great demand 
for our dentists.” True. The big cities 
are somewhat over-populated with pro- 
fessional men but the people in the small 
towns are still buying teeth from a ped- 
dler. The alumni of the Negro colleges 
are slowly learning the value of scholar- 
ships, but the cars must be paid for and

THE INTERNATIONAL CON- 
GRESS FOR ART, EDUCA- 
TION, ETC. 


ELEN H. SMITH writes for 

help in collecting an exhibit of 
Negro children’s work. She has sent 
the following letter to 200 Negro 
schools : : 

The International Art Congress, 
which will meet in Prague, Austria, dur- 
ing the summer of 1928, is a convention 
of members and delegates from repre- 
sentative countries of the world, and 
holds at the same time an international 
art exhibit consisting chiefly of educa- 
tional exhibits in drawing, design and 
industrial art. 

I have been appointed by Mr. Augus- 
tus F. Rose, Chairman, to to be a mem- 
ber of his committee and have charge of 
the Negro art exhibit to be gathered 
from our schools in this country. 

This exhibit is open to all peoples of 
the United States, and affords an oppor-

LIFE AND LIBERTY 
R. THOMAS WOODY of the 


University of Pennsylvania has 
been talking plainly according to the 
Philadelphia Record. 


Linking the American Legion with the 
Ku Klux Klan and describing both as 
“American monstrosities” for what they 
threaten to do to teachers of American 
history who seek to spread truth rather 
than nationalistic propaganda, Dr. 
Thomas Woody, of the University of 
Pennsylvania, made one of the most out- 
spoken presentations ever heard at a 
Schoolmen’s Week on the University 
campus, yesterday. His talk was on 
“National Education and Beyond” and 
was given before the section on Com- 
parative Education. He spoke gently of 
members of the D. A. R., saying that 
they were misguided and reflected the 


May, 1928 


training received in the “finishing 
schools” of the past generation. But 
there was nothing mealy-mouthed in his 
dealing with Legion and Klan. 

“There is exhibited a tendency to culti- 
vate the belief that the nation can do no 
wrong. According to this view, history 
must show the nation to be always in 
the right. This certainly is no more of 
an insult to a man’s intelligence than is 
the dictum ‘my country, right or wrong’ 
to his moral respectability. 

“Nevertheless, to buttress the notion 
that we have always been right and led 
by angelic heroes, laws have been passed 
by enlightened American Common- 
wealths seeking to guarantee that the 
officially approved history shall not be 
tampered with, and teachers have been 
investigated for criticizing the policy of 
their Government.” 

This merits a quotation from Arthur 
Garfield Hays’ new book “Let Free- 
dom Ring”. 

“All men are created wicked and are 
endowed by their Creator with certain 
limited Privileges—that among these are 
Life (if you don’t drink), Liberty (if 
you conform) and the pursuit of Gloom. 
That to secure these privileges, Govern- 
ments are instituted among Men, deriv- 
ing their just powers from the consent 
of the Ku Klux Klan, the Anti-Saloon 
League, the W. C. T. U., the Lord’s 
Day Alliance, The American Defense 
League, the Key Men of America, the 
Watch and Ward Societies, the Anti- 
Vice Associations, and every variety of 
Crusader, Vigilant, Reformer and 
Crank.” 

And speaking of the right to think, 
we discover among readers of THE 
Crisis some persons who want nothing 
printed with which they do not per- 
sonally agree. For instance, Dr. S. P. 
Berry of Cleveland, writes: 


In the minds of many readers of THE 
Crisis, the March number was com- 
pletely spoiled by “The Second Genera- 
tion”. The method of expression may 
have been inspired, but the subject-mat- 
ter was nothing short of damnation. Mr. 
Allison Davis has made a mess of try- 
ing to tie the lambs tail to that of the 
lion. 

Is it a joke, a dream, or a fact? Ifa 
fact, what hope can the mothers and 
fathers of our youths hold—except, per- 
haps, to be English teachers? We were 
taught for centuries to carry our load 
to the “Big White House”, while free 
in body our souls, tho educated, still 
carry on—to the Big White Man. Black 
folks in the professions are having the 
time of their lives trying to show Black 
folks that the white man’s ice is not 
colder than that sold by Black men. 

Let the Poet’s Corner be a Poet's 
Corner and let that poetry do good. We 
can ill afford to do ourselves harm.” 

S. R. Walker of Villanova, Pennsyl- 
vania, adds to this: 

As the purpose of THE Crisis, as far 
as I can understand, is for the uplifting 
of our race and the advancement of its 
interests, I fail to see what benefit can 
be derived from the reading of such 


sordid outpourings as those of the above 
mentioned author. If Mr. Allison act- 
ually believes such things of the second 
generation then he should be encouraged 
to keep his rank and degrading thoughts 
to himself and not to circulate them in 
a magazine of the character of THE 
Crisis, whose purpose, ostensibly, is to 
inspire higher aspirations and ambitions 
than he evidently possesses. 

May I ask why you give space to 
such unjust, uncalled for criticism of 
the Negro race by a man who appears 
to be inferior to the-task he has tried to 
do?” 

Finally, Presley Holliday calls from 
Seattle: 

Do you agree with Eugene Gordon’s 
statement in the American Mercury for 
February that “Like their gentlemen 
friends, most cream-colored Aframerican 
ladies are intellectual featherweights” ? 
Do you consider it a mark of intelli- 
gence for a Negro, knowing how the 
Negro’s inhibitions were acquired, thus 
to subject him to ridicule for having 
them? 

The local Negro paper, the Seattle 
Enterprise, commenting, not unfavorably, 
on Mr. Gordon’s article ask, “After all, 
in the last analysis, is not the college- 
bred Negro the most ignorant and stupid 
in the racial body?” Is not this an 
alarming position for one who, in the 
natural course of things, is supposed to 
stand for the best opportunity for the 
race? If Negro editors begin to doubt 
the practical benefits resulting from the 
higher education of the Negro and give 
evidence of their belief that a college 
education makes him the most ignorant 
and stupid in the racial body, Southern 
opponents of Negro education will use 
such persons’ views as confirmation of 
the age-old Southern theory that “to 
educate a Negro is to spoil a good field 
hand”. 

All we can think of to say is: “Well, 
well, WELL!” 


FLORIDA SCHOOLS 


T is high time that Negro tax payers 

do some real constructive work with 
reference to the length of term given to 
Negro schools in most places in Florida. 
The Legislature every two years creates 
extra taxes on different commodities for 
school purposes and yet Negro school 
terms are being cut shorter and shorter. 
The one cent gas tax and the fish and 
game tax recently levied have not done 
anything towards helping Negro schools 
in many Counties. 

On the other hand some Counties have 
actually cut the term of the Negro 
schools. I do not want to appear as a 
leader but if I can get ten persons to 
meet me in central locations, say Or- 
landa, Ocalo or Tampa with the express 
purpose of going into the courts and see 
if we can not get a more equitable por- 
tion of the school funds of the state, 
county and districts, I will do so. 

The Constitution of Florida provides 
for separate schools for white and col- 
ored but the funds, according to the con-

Editor. 


THE NEGRO POLITICIAN 


HILE I was in Chicago, a lis- 

tener at Winnetka threw this 
question at me, tensely, with evident 
deep resentment: “What have you to 
say to the course of Negro politicians 
who are following Thompson in the 
municipal campaign?” I answered the 
question indirectly and unsatisfactorily, 
because its fuller answer would have 
called for a lecture in itself. I said 
merely, “The Negro in Chicago and 
-the Negro in New York has as much 
right to ally himself to political graft 
as represented by Tammany and 


168 


fostacfte 


MED 


Thompson, as have more respectable 
people, in allying themselves with Insul 
and Vare and Frank Smith.” 

The whole matter, however, calls 
for deeper explanation and frank heart 
searching on the part of the American 
Negro. What happens to us contin- 
ually is this: If we keep out of politics, 
we give the whip hand to our enemies. 
They pass segregation laws; they cur- 
tail liberty of the press and of speech; 
they hinder the right to organize; they 
discriminate by law, not simply against 
color, but against ignorance and pov- 
erty and the victims of any deep-seated 
public dislike. We have got to vote 
or be enslaved. 

When we vote, we do not have a 
chance to vote on the real merits of 
the questions presented. We cannot 
consider the tariff, farm relief, war, 
peace, municipal ownership, super- 
power, and a dozen other pressing po- 
litical questions. No, we have got to 
ask: Does Herbert Hoover believe that 
Negroes are men or sub-men? What 
is the attitude of Al Smith toward the 
Negro problem? Does Reed of Mis- 
souri believe in education for Negroes 
or is he part of the consipracy that de- 
prives Lincoln University of decent 
buildings? Can any man born south of 
the Mason and Dixon Line be for a 
moment considered as a man or must he 
always be put down as a raging beast, 
in alliance with lynching, disfranchise- 
ment, “Jim Crow” cars, and public 
insult ? 

Under such circumstances, intelli- 
gent voting on the part of colored men 
in the United States becomes a dis- 
heartening farce. In Chicago, they 
can choose between two things: on the 
one hand, open gambling, bootlegging, 
prostitution, and Thompson; and on 
the other hand, segregation, denial of 
representation, loss of decent jobs and 
public insult under Deneen or the 
Democrats. What on earth is an hon- 
est black voter to do? 

In New York, there is the same im- 
possible dilemma. Tammany and a 
Mayor, who is still unable to explain a 
certain incident in Italy; on the other 
silk-stocking snobs, who refuse the Ne- 
groes representation and gerrymander 
them out of the city Hall, the state 





re 


legislature and the United States Con- 
gress. 

In the same way, the Philadelphia 
Negro can choose between Vare and 
bribery, or graft, Pepper, snobbery, and 
“Jim Crow” schools. 

Who can blame the American Negro 
if he votes for the worst, when it is 
only in this sort of alliance that he 
can receive the semblance of decent 
treatment ? 

On the other hand, it is perfectly 
clear that the Negroes who are sup- 
porting graft and political machines in 
the chief cities of the United States, 
are thereby incurring the distrust, en- 
mity and active opposition of the in- 
telligent people of the United States; 
of those very people who with all their 
vision, never, so far as the Negro is 
concerned, see beyond their own noses. 


THIRKIELD 


ISHOP WILBUR P. THIR- 

KIELD of the M. E. Church re- 
tires from the active ministry this 
spring. A testimonial has been given 
him at Bennett College, Greensboro, 
North Carolina, with many distin- 
guished persons present. Bishop Thir- 
kield has been a friend of American 
black folk, and through a long life of 
unusual activity, passed largely in the 
South, he has not failed to be counted 
against race prejudice and for universal 
democracy in this land. 


BLACKLIST 

HE Editor has had the honor to 

be blacklisted by the Daughters of 
the American Revolution, along with 
President Wooley, Felix Frankfurter, 
Anna Louise Strong, Clarence Darrow, 
Stephen Wise, Norman Hapgood, 
Frank P. Walsh, David Starr Jordan, 
and most other Americans with either 
brains or backbone. The Editor is 
deeply obliged and begs to express here- 
by his sense of the honor conferred. 


THE SPRING PILGRIMAGE, 
1928. 
T began Saturday, March 3rd, when 


I rushed 973 miles to Chicago, ar- 
riving one-half hour late and finding

that Aurora, instead of being an hour 
away was nearly one hour and a half. 
| was late at the community forum in 
the leading Congregational Church, 
hut the audience had waited graciously 
and listened to modern problems of 
race and color. 

| intimated that we are so sensitive 
at times that we see race prejudice 
where it does not exist. The Chairman 
afterward said: “True! I notified the 
colored churches that special seats 
would be reserved them and they tele- 
phoned in horror: ‘Do not reserve spe- 
cial seats!’”’ He really didn’t mean 
anything, he explained. Then I went 
hack to Chicago and to the Hotel 
Grand, quiet and efficient, with a beau- 
tiful outlook on bronze George Wash- 
ington and the park. That night I 
spoke at a radical forum in West Chi- 
cago. 

Monday, I had a thousand North- 
western students who listened to the 
story of Negro literature in the Chapel 
Church, and then I lunched with Hers- 
kovits and his wife. That night, with 
my hat on, I talked in an orthodox 
Jewish synagogue. ‘Tuesday, I went 
out to Winnetka, to a settlement of 
young Jewish married couples: edu- 
cated, smart, well-to-do, in beautiful 
homes with a new synagogue; racially 
intensely conscious, so much so that 
when I spoke of “your race”, they 
thought I meant Jews; when I really 
meant white folk. There were per- 
haps 50 of them, in a lovely parlor. 

Wednesday, I looked at the new 
dance hall in Chicago, the Savoy; a 
part of a large amusement plant, rep- 
resenting an investment by white cap- 
ital to entertain the black South Side. 
Thursday, the Desaible Club of a hun- 
dred colored men met at the Appom- 
matox, and I went through the eco- 
nomic development of Negroes. Fri- 
day, I dined with Dr. Bentley. 

Then, after five interesting days, I 
went back 247 miles to the University 
of Michigan, and, introduced by the 
charming brown girl President of the 
Negro-Caucasian ‘Club, talked to per- 
haps 400. Afterward, we had dinner 
at the Union. There was that curious 
pause before we sat down to the table 
which always betokens some racial 
trouble. You see, white and colored 
students, men and women, and some 
teachers, were all going to eat together. 
It would not do to have them in the 
main dining room. We had a nice 
Private dining room and the most in- 
teresting dinner. At night, some 25 or 
more, met at a professor’s house. The 
wife tended the babies and sketched me. 
The students asked all questions un- 
der the sun. After that, 36 miles to 
Detroit, with 750 black folk in the Y. 


M. C. A. gymnasium, a strong audi- 
ence, 


May, 1928 


The next day, I talked to some 500 
at the City College and in the after- 
noon, to a group of perhaps 40 stu- 
dents. One girl, with a kindling face, 
finished the day with this question: 
“How would you like to have your 
daughter marry a white man?” I was 
frank. 

Then 168 miles to Grand Rapids. 
Just what happened in Grand Rapids, 
I do not yet know. I was asked to 
come by white people. Then colored 
people asked for a second engagement. 
Then white and colored canceled the 
second engagement. I stayed at a 
white hotel; was entertained graciously 
at dinner and lunch by groups of white 
men. I came to my audience and 
found it almost entirely a colored audi- 
ence. I saw practically no colored 
people to meet or talk to. What hap- 
pened in Grand Rapids? 

From Grand Rapids, 100 miles to 
South Bend and a quiet home. “Re- 
vivals” had been going on for five 
weeks and “souls” were still yelling. 
There were 100 persons to listen and 
a kindly white minister. I rushed that 
night 85 miles to Chicago; changed 
bags at the hotel; and then 408 miles 
to Minneapolis, with a sleeper only to 
seven in the morning, and then a long 
day ride through Wisconsin and 
Minnesota. We stopped for dinner 
and I ate a full one. The Conductor 
asked me if I enjoyed it. ‘We held 
the train for you,” he said. There 
was a reception at Wheatly House and 
cosy hospitality at B. S. Smith’s; a 
large meeting in a colored church and, 
next day, three hours of discussion at 
the Saturday Luncheon Club,—most 
inspiring. Then back again over those 
408 miles to Chicago and to the Up- 
town Forum, Sunday night with per- 
haps 750 people; eager listeners. 

Monday, I was off 284 miles to 
Missouri, where I stayed at Poro and 
found the waitresses unusually efficient 
and polite. Fifteen Hundred people 
were at the new colored high school, 
St. Louis, and Charles Nagel, ex-Secre- 
tary of Commerce and Labor, intro- 
duced me with kindly words. I found 
Buckner just dead; that most promis- 
ing of our new Western financial 
leaders. 

At Jefferson City, 125 miles away, 
I spoke to the students and rode in the 
night; a school without a plant and a 
state too mean and dishonest to build 
one; and then I began a wandering 
among Missouri railroads; 51 miles 
and three and one-half hours wait to 
“Mexico”. Another 50 miles and one- 
half hours wait at “Louisiana”. Twen- 
ty-four miles to Hannibal and a gor- 
geous dinner. .There was an earnest 
audience of 100, who endured a 30- 
minute introduction. The Baptists were 
not present. Their pastor had held 
over his ten-day revival so as to in- 


clude my lecture. Then back to 
“Louisiana” and “Centralia,” where 
instead of two and one-half hours to 
wait, there came a comfortable auto 
and two nice men. 

We went over to Columbia, where 
the white University of Missouri lurks. 
I shall never forget that audience. It 
was in the spacious and well-built gym- 
nasium of the colored school, and my 
startled eyes looked down upon flappers 
and grey-beards, white and black, 250 
students and a few professors from the 
white University of Missouri, and 300 
working people and others from col- 
ored Columbia where they lynched a 
man recently. I talked on the “Con- 
tributions which the Negro has made 
to American Civilization”, but just 
what my own contribution was that 
night to this astonishing audience, I 
fear I shall never know. 

Next day, I went off 178 miles to 
Kansas City and to Beatrice Frances. 
Beatrice Frances is four. She will be 
“five on the 28th of next July”. I 
found favor in the dark eyes of Bea- 
trice Frances and when I started to go 
Sunday night, she said aside to 
Mother: “We don’t want him to go, 
do we? Ask him to stay until Tues- 
day or something!” 

On Saturday night, the black leaders 
of Missouri were in Kansas City, on 
their way to the Republican Conven- 
tion at St. Joseph. They came and 
greeted me. On Sunday night, 800 
persons or more, seven-eights of them 
white, sat before me on the free plat- 
form of the Linwood Church. It was 
pretty nearly a Southern white audi- 
ence. They were ready for plain talk 
and I think they got it; but both 
Pickens and White had paved the way. 

In the discussicn, one Southern 
white man had gotten too much. He 
asserted with his lovely drawl, that he 
was “interested” in colored people, but 
that I was claiming too much. “Of 
course, everybody knows that Cauca- 
sians are superior!” 

Finally, 450 miles to Chicago and to 
the dinner of the Delta Sigma Theta. 
Two hundred assembled at the City 
Club and we assayed Negro literature. 
It was a charming ending. Then 960 
miles home. 

Thus for 25 days I spoke to 20 
audiences of 9250 persons—5500 white 
and 3750 colored. I travelled 4729 
miles and I saw and heard far more 
than I can tell. Altogether the mes- 
sage spelled Hope. 


OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE 
HERE can be no doubt but what 


the whole economic future of the 
Negro in America is ready for new 
thought and new planning. All the 
old slogans and old advice are worth- 
less. To ask an individual colored

man today to go into the grocery busi- 
ness or to open a drygoods shop or to 
sell meat, shoes, candy, books, cigars, 
clothes or fruit is competition with the 
Chain Store, is to ask him to commit 
slow but almost inevitable economic 
suicide, unless he has some unusual lo- 
cal or personal advantage. 

The individual shopkeeper is dis- 
appearing in the American world, and 
his place is being taken by great coun- 
try-wide organizations which sell food, 
clothes, cars, coal, coffee, furniture and 
hundreds of other things to meet the 
needs of men; and sell them at a price 
which makes attempted competition 
futile. The managers of these stores 
are appointed, and usually no colored 
men need apply. The workers in the 
stores and factories are hired, either in 
agreement with unions that keep out 
Negroes, or on an open shop basis, 
where Negroes are admitted only at 
the lowest wages. 

In general industry, Negroes can be- 
come common laborers, underpaid and 
thereby ousting white competitors and 
thus engendering deep racial hatreds. 
Only in exceptional cases do Negroes 
get a chance in the higher ranks of 
skilled laborers or as Foreman or Man- 
agers. 

In the credit world Negroes get 
bank credit with much greater diff- 
culty than white men of equal honesty 
and ability. Negro banks are small 
and in any crisis they are dependent 
on the white banks of the city, and, of 
course, on the great white banking ring 
of the country. If for any reason, any 
influential part of any community 
wishes to crush a Negro bank, the 
bank is worse than helpless. The story 
of Memphis confirms this. 

Nearly all of the old independent 
trades are now part of highly organ- 
ized combinations, financed with large 
capital: like bakers, blacksmiths, fire- 
men, jewelers, cigar-makers, painters, 
cabinetmakers, shoemakers, tailors, up- 
holsters, tinsmiths, and any number of 
others. Men in the building trades are 
at the mercy of powerful trade unions, 
contractors backed endless bank credit 
and real estate combinations. In trans- 
portation, the Negro is absolutely ex- 
cluded by the railroad unions and only 
has a desperate chance as longshoreman 
and laborer. 

In the whole realm of manufactur- 
ing under the factory system, the Ne- 
gro is excluded by the trades union 
and the deliberate and wide spread 
agreement of employers. Outside the 
cigar-making factories and the needle 
trades, there are practically no Negro 
operatives in cotton mills, candy fac- 
tories, furniture factories, grain mills, 
leather factories, brass, copper, lead 
and zinc mills, paper mills, textile mills 
and hundreds of the like. 


170 





In the realm of personal service, the 
Negro has a chance as porter and ser- 
vant, and in service for his own race. 
In professional service we have a first- 
rate record of desert in medicine, den- 
tistry, literature, law, music and teach- 
ing, and a long tradition in the minis- 
try; but these professions depend on a 
strong wage earning and income re- 
ceiving mass and this we grievously 
lack. 

In agriculture, thirty years training 
by Hampton and Tuskegee has de- 
creased the proportion of Negro farni- 
ers in the colored population, and so 
few of their graduates have become 
farmers that they refuse to publish the 
figures. Hampton and Tuskegee are 
not to blame for this. They attempted 
the impossible. Farming for white and 
black today in the United States is a 
failing, unprofitable business; and the 
efforts to help it—farm credits and 
farm relief,—are not for Negroes. 

In the face of this situation, there 
is no organized and thoughtful effort 
toward reform. The industrial school 
never accomplished the object which it 
had in mind, and which it widely ad- 
vertised. It has not filled the land 
with Negro carpenters, bricklayers, 
wagon-builders, cooks and printers. 
Only to a limited extent are such 
schools training artisans today and all 
of the major industrial schools are be- 
ing transformed into colleges. 

What is to be done? There is to 
my mind only one way out: Manufac- 
turing and consumers co-operation 
among the major part of twelve mil- 
lion people on a wide and ever-increas- 
ing scale. There must be the slow, but 
carefully planned growth of manufac- 
turing trusts, beginning with the rais- 
ing of raw material on Negro farms; 
extending to its transportation on Ne- 
gro trucks; its manufacture in Negro 
factories; its distribution to Negro co- 
operative stores, supported by intelli- 
gent and loyal Negro consumers. 

Such an organization is above and 
beyond race prejudice and trust compe- 
tition. Once: established on the basis 
of the English, Scandinavian, German 
and Russian co-operatives, it would in- 
sure the economic independence of the 
American Negro for all time. 

Beside this could grow credit systems 
and co-operative banks which could 
bring the Negro-American group into 
carefully articulated co-operation with 
the West Indies and South America; 
with West Africa and South Africa. 

It is more than idiotic—it is crim- 
inal, for American Negroes to stagger 
blindly on, hugging the fond illusion 
that white philanthropy through in- 
dustrial education, is going to furnish 
them with future steady employment 
and economic independence. It is 
equally idiotic to hope that white 





laborers will become broad enough or 
wise enough to make the cause of black 
labor their own. These things yi] 
never be done in our day. Our ep. 
nomic future lies in the hands of care. 
fully trained thinkers, technical engi. 
neers, and the unswerving will to sac. 
rifice on the part of intelligent masses,

writes us: 

I am much interested by the article jn 
the last Crisis concerning Robert E. Lee

that I am now studying Lee’s life. | 
have been doing that for some months, 
I am writing something which may or

you do in that article. I maintain, in 
sentences written weeks ago, that if Lee 
did not know that he was fighting for 
slavery, he was almost mentally deficient, 

After all, Wendell Phillip was a seer, 
and he perceived and told the truth about 
Lee’s moral nature, in his address on 
the death of Lincoln. 

I think, however, that Lee was a 
traitor to his country, as well as to hu- 
manity. A rebel is not always a traitor 
to his country; that matter depends on 
the righteousness or unrighteousness of 
the cause for which he rebels. Lee's 
cause was evil,—and he did not even be- 
lieve that secession would be good for 
the South. 

You know, of course, that there have 
been statements made in several promin- 
ent books, that Lee freed, early in his 
life, such slaves as he personally owned. 
I have hunted that statement down to 
find its source, and two of Lee’s most 
eminent champions have admitted that 
they knew of no authority for the state- 
ment. One of these persons had himself 
made it in a book, which has probably 
done more than any other single volume, 
to create this modern idolatry of Lee. 

“Justice and Truth” adds: 


Your Postscript on Robert E. Lee in 
the Marcu Crisis leads me to suggest 
that you obtain a file of the N. Y. Trib- 
une of June 14, 1890, and read the letter 
of Henry Stone of Boston who shows 
from General Townsend’s book, that 
Lee’s only reason for becoming secession- 
ist, and giving up his military oath, was 
his statement to General Scott: “Gen- 
eral, the property belonging to my chil- 
dren, all they possess, lies in Virginia. 
They will be ruined if they do not go 
with their state. I cannot raise my hand 
against my children.” Also, the English 
eulogist of Lee, General Maurice in his 
Life, gives a letter by Lee—and one by 
his wife—each showing Lee did not be- 
lieve secession was right. It was only 
selfish regard for property that led Lee 
= desert the country which had made 

im. 

Also, get a file of the New York Sun, 
October 18, 1900, and read Dana’s ter- 
rible editorial denunciation of Lee. 
“Should Lee be in the Hall of Fame?” 
This editorial should never be forgotten.

The Young Blood Hungers 
(Continued from page 151) 


hollows within—seeking to catch up 
with something greater than yourself 
in a swift mad consuming fire-flash of 
living? 

—It’s the gnawing pains.— 

Gnawing pains make you toss your 
body around. Make you toss your 
body now this way—now that. Young 
Blood hungers. Young Blood feels the 
gnawing pains of hunger—you do not 
know where your body will come— 
where it will go. All you wish js to 
toss your self away from the pain 
gnawing within. 

—It’s the gnawing pains.— 

Can a mote appear to lay blindness 
across the vision? 

Isn’t there a part of Young Blood 
that leapt into being at Eternity and 
goes on through all Eternity? Isn't 
there something that sees beyond curls 
and rouge? 

—I speak not for myself alone, 
Lord.— 

Something winding and winding in 
the rhythmic inanities of a dance, 
Young Blood hears things beside the 
music—the feet—the talk—the chaff 
of laughter. 

Sometimes when you teeter to a 
jazz-band’s play voices speak within 
you and seem to say: 


H dance, fool! Dance! 

You may prance, fool, prance 
You may skim, you may slide, 
You may dip, you may glide, 
But you’ve lied to yourself, 
Oh you’ve lied—lied—lied. 
—Gave a damn for the night— 
—Chanced your all upon Today— 
But you’ve lied! Yes you've lied! 
—I’m the Voice that never died. 


OICES and Hunger. Searchings 

and Seekings. Stumbling—fall- 
ing—rising again. —I speak not for 
myself alone, Lord! The Young Blood 
hungers. —Back toward an Eternity. 
Facing Eternity. Perhaps that is the 
way in which Young Blood is to sit— 
back toward an Eternity—face toward 
an Eternity—hungering. 

Perhaps it must be that God must be 
sought in new ways—new ways— 
fewer steps—fewer steps—each time 
there comes Young Blood—each time 
there comes Young Blood—until they 
find Him. 

A few less steps each time. A few 
less steps each time. 

Soon the top. 

Then—no longer Hunger. 

Then no longer—Hunger. 

—I speak not for myself alone, 
Lord! The Young Blood hungers—

be said, as Roosevelt pointed out, for 
an increased birthrate. 

These dances were outlawed by 
‘Toussaint L’Ouverture, by decree of 
January 8, 1800,° on the alleged 
ground that they led to political dis- 
turbances. They have been rebanned 
by the Americans. The possession of 
a voodoo drum by a native means its 
confiscation, plus a fine or jail sentence. 
The drums still boom in the hills. 

As an ingrained conservative, we re- 
gret the passing of such good old cus- 
toms as Congo cannibalism, Greek 
symposiums, and Haitian voodoo 
dances. 

(To be concluded in the June Crisis) 


Banks in Memphis 
(Continued from page 154) 
banks, which in former years had often 
been willing to give aid, now in every 
case refused; but the Negroes raised 
among themselves between $60,000 
and $70,000. Nevertheless, the inci- 
dent became known and caused a 
three-day run. The bank was com- 
pelled to close. Then came the ex- 

traordinary revelation. 

After closing the institution and go- 
ing into the records, the examiners 
discovered within 24 hours more than 
they had been able to discover in 10 
years, with reference to the Fraternal 
Savings Bank affairs. They discov- 
ered and announced to the public that 
the President had embezzled to the 
amount of $50,000 and associated with 
him in his crooked deals were the As- 
sistant Cashier and Teller. A few 
days later they announced that the 
shortage would reach probably $250,- 
000 or $300,000. In other words, the 
shortage of the Consolidated Bank was 
almost equal to the total resources 
of the former Fraternal bank! Yet 
these same examiners were the ones 
that had examined Mr. Ward’s bank- 
ing activities five or six times a year 
for a number of years and had appar- 
ently been unable to discover anything 
wrong or even suspicious. 

Of course, the colored people be- 
lieve an entirely different story. They 
believe that Ward had been looting 
his bank for a series of years and that 
the bank examiners knew it; that they 
connived at the union of this totter- 
ing bank with the perfectly sound Solv- 
ent Bank and that some powerful 
group in Memphis wished this in or- 
der to kill both banks and to strike a 
blow both at the political and at the 
economic leadership of Negroes by Ne- 
groes in the financial center of the

great Southern Mississippi Valley. 
Some have even insinuated that the 
Exalted Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan 
had issued an edict and that edict was 
being carried out. 


HE action of the bank examiners 
and-the public after the defalca- 
tion of Ward was discovered, was 
curiously different from their usual 
action in the case of tottering banks. 


» Generally, every effort was made to 


minimize the impending disaster and 
protect credit. If bonds were required 
for liquidation, only officers and di- 
rectors were notified and not the gen- 
eral public lest the action hurt the 
credit of some of those white direc- 
tors and cripple their business before 
they could pay the bond. Not so in 
the case of the directorate of the Frat- 
ernal Solvent Savings Bank. In spite 
of the fact that they were men of honor 
and business standing, the fact of their 
having signed a bond was turned over 
to reporters; the most delicate informa- 
tion concerning every move which 
they had made to safeguard the de- 
positors and the public was given out 
to newspaper men. 

Confidential business of men deal- 
ing with the bank was flagrantly dis- 
closed to the public. They published 
the names of corresponding banks, 
eens among others a little bank run 
by Negro farmers at Indianola, Mis- 
sissippi, as having “a large sum” in 
the defunct bank. This caused a run 
and that bank closed. Afternoon edi- 
tions announced that this was “a mis- 
take”. The Indianola bank had little 
or nothing on deposit. Indeed, appar- 
ently in their eagerness to deal Negro 
business a crushing blow, the exam- 
iners give the public information suf- 
ficient to convince anyone that they 
themselves were either incompetent or 
criminally negligent. The Memphis 
banking world stood aloof. When 
other failures were threatened in the 
past banks rushed in with the cash to 
enable the threatened to withstand the 
runs; they muzzled the press; they 
gave to the public what they thought 
the public ought to know and no more; 
in some cases where the entire capital 
and surplus of these white institutions 
were completely wiped out, other bank- 
ing groups supplied new capital or 
took them over; where assets were 
f,ozen, they furnished liquid assets un- 
til the frozen assets could be realized. 
In this case they did nothing. 


OME matters were brought out in 

the case of the Solvent Bank and 
criticized which, if properly under- 
stood, should bring only praise, and 
which illustrated the peculiarly diff- 
cult field in which a Negro bank to- 
day operates. Endorsements of well- 


to-do Negro citizens were used often 
in this bank instead of commercial pa. 
per as security. But this is almost 
necessary because of the peculiar ego. 
nomic situation of Negroes today, 
Moreover, it had been proven safe: 
some years ago the Negroes started 
the Citizens Co-operative 
which prospered for a while all over 
Memphis; but eventually they were 
unable to meet the competition of the 
white Chain grocery store. They 
tailed. The Solvent Bank took up 
much of their endorsed paper and these 
notes were gradually paid off over a 
series of years; it was only a matter 
of time when the obligations would 
have been completely liquidated. 
This then is the situation. The dis- 
aster affected more than 15,000 in- 
dustrious and thrifty Negro deposit- 
ors, and over fifty colored corporations 
and firms. It paralyzed 70,000 Ne. 
groes living in Memphis, and yet it 
was looked upon by the white press 
and white public of this territory as a 
huge joke; they “kidded” the thrifty 
hotel waiter who happened to be a di- 
rector; they brought to the forefront 
the tom-cat which lived at the bank; 
they reproduced the lies of ante-bel- 
lum Negroes who never had a cent of 


Stores, 


money in the bank, and who took 
pleasure in talking to “their white 
folks”. They gave to these Negroes 


front page stories in large type, while 
scarcely a word was said about the 
sacrifices made by intelligent Negroes 
to save the institution after the run 
had started and after their sister white 
institutions had refused to offer aid. 


HAT will be the result in Mem- 

phis? It is interesting to quote 
from a black man on the spot: 

“Whatever the cause —the faith, 

hope and confidence of the thinking 
Negroes of Memphis is not shattered. 
They are as yet undefeated and in 
the language of the poet:

This can and should be modified by 
the experience of each family, to fit 
peculiar local conditions. But it can 
be seen that a family with an income 
of $50 per week can spend $260 per 
year for insurance. A family with an 
income of $75 per week can spend $390 
per year for insurance. On $100 per 
week at least $10 per week, or $520 
per year can be spent for insurance. 
And on $125 to $150 per week it 
would not be out of place to spend at 
least $1,000 a year for insurance. 

Now if an insurance program is 
laid out and insurance is bought on 
an intelligent basis these amounts can 
be made to leave the family in at least 
the same financial circumstances if not 
better, whenever the head of the fam- 
ily and income producer dies. At age 
35, of the highest type of risk: 

$260 a year will pay for $10,000 
of insurance; $390 a year will pay for 
$15,000 of insurance; $520 a year 
will pay for $20,000 of insurance, and 
$1,000 a year will pay for $40,000 of 


insurance. 


F taken earlier than age 35, these 
amounts will be appreciably in- 
creased. If not taken until age 40 or 
45 or later, the amounts obtained for

these sums will be likewise decreased 
The moral then is to get all the in. 
surance you can carry, get it early ip 
life because of the favorable rate, never 
allow a policy to lapse, and then add 
to your holdings as your income jp. 
creases. 

If you are afraid to leave so much 
cash to be paid in one lump sum to 
your widow or to your son or to your 
daughter, you can arrange to have the 
whole amount paid over to a Trust 
Company, or you can leave it with 
the Insurance Company, to be invested 
and the income paid over to your bene- 
ficiaries in monthly payments that will 
never cease. Or you can have these 
monthly payments stop at the end of 
10 or 20 years or any other time when 
your children arrive at maturity and 
the whole amount turned over to them 
to do with as they may need: 

Twenty thousand dollars if it can 
be invested at 6% will bring in $100 
a month to your beneficiary as long 
as she lives, and to her heirs there- 
after. Forty thousand dollars invested 
in high-grade stocks or bonds under 
the direction of a Trust Company or 
an Insurance Company can make your 
descendants independent for life. And 
this income is certain. There is no 
gamble about it. No speculation and 
no worry. 

Sometime soon, you who are read- 
ing this, sit down and check over your 
insurance policies. See how much you 
have, and what you are paying. Go 
over your income. See if you cannot 
put more into life insurance, then call 
in your friend, that young man or wo- 
man whom you know to be represent- 
ing some company of our group—and 
they are all good companies—and let 
him help you to lay the foundation of a 
fortune for your wife and your own 
bright boy and girl or that mother 
and father who sacrificed to make you 
what you are today.

of a muskrat as though you descended 
from periwig days, feather of an owl! 
Marked thus you come to us. From 
where?” indignantly continued Cap- 
tain Float as Acorn Cap was being 
landed on deck. 

Head drooped, Acorn suffered four 
kobolds to lead him below while a song 
that the merry passengers had been 
singing, 


“Fair young night,

this period. The second period was 
inaugurated by Booker T. Washington 
whose program of opportunism is well 
known and ended with his death. The 
causes of the new leadership brought 
on by the World War, were the spread 
of education and the urbanization of 
the Negro population. The new lead- 
ership is a creative one, sponsored by 
educated men with scientifically trained 
minds. While these men believe Ne- 
groes should participate in political af- 
fairs, they do not make a fetish of this, 
but view politics in relation to other 
social forces. 

Harold P. Marley in The South 
Atlantic Quarterly for January, tells 
us of the new approach to “The Negro 
in Recent Sounthern Literature”. An 
attempt is being made to look at life 
through the Negro’s eyes. ‘The re- 
sult is that Negroes in literature are 
no longer playing the roles of support- 
ing characters to white plots, but are 
standing on their own feet, moving in 
and out of their own recondite com- 
munities. 

“Nobody knows de trouble I see, 

Nobody knows but Jesus”. 

This is the song lament of an 
anguished people. ‘The Reverend A. 
M. Chirgwin, who tells the story of 
“The Vogue of the Negro Spiritual” 
in the Edinburgh Review for January, 
says America has given little of sheer 
beauty to the world and counts the 
Spirituals as her greatest artistic 
achievement. Mr. Chirgwin paints a 
vivid picture of these elusive melodies 
of misery which found their medium 
in the strong black throats of slaves.

stitution must be used according to ration 
with no difference in term or anything 
else on account of the color. We have 
set by and let this unjust discrimination 
go on long enough and what I am sug- 
gesting is that the colored people in every 
county affected come together and raise 
a fund and hire the best counsel obtain- 
able to fight this thing in courts. It 
can’t make conditions any worse and we 
have many reasons to believe it will 
settle once for all the term of our 
schools. 


May we mention here a case in our 
county (Manafee): the district Board 
(Bradenton) in making up the 1927-28 
budget for school purposes included in 
the budget for teachers salaries alone 
about $78,000; through my efforts they 
included $12,000 for the colored schools 
of the district. There was available or 
allotted something over $4,000 from the 
general fund for Negro schools of this 
particular district. None of the gas tax 
or fish and game tax were allotted to the 
colored schools of this district. Never- 
theless this made over $16,000 available 
for Negro schools. If the colored schools 
with the present number of teachers had 
run eight months the salaries would have 
amounted to $7,200. Nevertheless they 
cut the Negro schools to five months pay- 
ing only $4,500 in salaries and thus de- 
prived Negro schools of over $11,500 of 
money actually appropriated. Mean- 
time the district was taxed to the limit 
904 the white schools amply provided 

or. 

We employed a lawyer to represent us 
at the Board and the figures and facts 
relative to the above condition was dis- 
closed by our lawyer in our presence 
and in the presence of a number of the 
county Board. This lawyer asked the 
Board to continue our school for three 
months longer or we would mandamus 
the Board. This the Board refused to 
do and mandamus proceedings were the 
next move. But the unfortunate thing 
was that the court would have had to 
settle it and of course the teachers would 
have had to wait until the courts acted 
to get their pay.

THE WRONG WAY 
TO DRESS YOUR HAIR 





Surface applications of so called slickers and straighteners are of no benefit — 
to permanently improve your hair. The right way to have beautiful, healthy 
hair is to have first, a healthy scalp. Madam C. J. Walker’s Wonderful Hair 
Grower is a foe to diseased, unhealthy scalps. When used according to direc- 
tions, it will relieve itching scalp, thin and falling hair, combat disease, in- 
vigorate the scalp and grow the hair long and thick, which may then be 
dressed beautifully correct. ’ 


You can’t go wrong using Madam C. J. Walker’s Wonder- 

ful Hair Grower. It is no make-shift top dressing for the 

hair, but is a world famous, widely used scalp food scien- 
tifically compounded, made of the purest med- 
icinal oils and essences, in correct proportion, 
to produce definite, good results. 


Go to your nearest Madam C. J. Walker 
Agent, druggist, or write to Mme. C. J. 
Walker Mfg. Co., Indiana Ave. at N. West St., 
to obtain a box of this guaranteed prepara- 
tion and start using it tonight. Your scalp 
will feel the difference, your hair will be 
naturally pretty.
