Southern Aid Society 
of Va., Inc. 


announces with pleasure the granting 

ers nm a by the department of Banking and 
a Insurance of the State of New Jersey, 

of a license to conduct its business in that state. 


The requirements were— 
a Paid-up Capital of $150,000 
a Surplus of 75,000 
a deposit of 10,000 


in approved bonds, a Legal Reserve to cover outstanding policies and 
evidence of ability to conduct the insurance business on the high plane 
now required by all progressive states. In all of these particulars this 
company was fully prepared to toe the mark. 


This step was in response to the invitation of hundreds of old policy- 
holders who have moved from Virginia and the South to that state, and 
who wanted to continue their Superior Three-in-One Insurance Protec- 
tion. These, and thousands of others will now have the opportunity to 


secure for One Small Premium, protection against Sickness, Disability 
and Death.

The Trail of the Buffaloes’ 


By CHAS. H. GARVIN + 


VERYWHERE, hellish machines 
of war and wanton destruction. 
Camouflage ! Ingenious and ghastly 
it stood against the horizon. Guns! 
Machine guns, partly hidden, with 
helts of cartridges partly consumed, 
many partly demolished. ‘Trenches! 
Shell holes, half filled with slimy water. 
“Pill-boxes,” ‘“‘dug-outs,” many de- 
molished, mere heaps of concrete and 
stone. Here and there, piles of un- 
used ammunition; empty shells, their 
deadly tasks performed. Wire! Wire 
everywhere, barbed and __ hideous. 
Rifles, abandoned and rusty; heaps of 
hand grenades, robbed by the Armis- 
tice of performing their deadly tasks. 
The stench of twisted, battered, decom- 
men, long since dead, some 
crumpled, others with their faces to the 
sun. The penetrating odor of stale 
poisonous gases. Graves, hastily made 
and grotesquely marked, in grimy fields 
that for four years had literally been 
“no man’s land.” Hordes of German 
soldiers, happily scurrying here and 
there, preparing to move back across 
the line to the Vaterland. On either 
side, towering hills concealed the heavy 
defence guns of Metz. 

This is the picture we saw as we 
rode along the banks of the tranquil 
Moselle, toward Metz, just a few 
hours after the cessation of hostilities 
—almost ten years ago—November 
1th, 1918. The memory of that ride 
will never be forgotten. 


UT ten years make many changes. 
Especially noticeable are the 
changes that have been wrought in the 
towns “at the front” of impregnable 
Metz—shell torn, devastated, and 
blood-soaked by the “Buffaloes.” 
Wheat grows there now, to the right 
and to the left—precious grain fertil- 
ized by the blood of black boys. The 
old, muddy, blood-stained trenches, 
@ grown now, are seen scarring the

a 
curred to us that a narrative of our 
experiences and our impressions might 
interest you and be of especial interest 
to the many thousands of “Buffaloes” 
to whom this is hallowed ground, hav- 
ing fought here so valiantly during 
those closing days of the war. It 
ought to interest also those Mothers 
and Fathers whose boys still sleep 
“over there.” 


N Armistice Day, November, 

1918, just three hours after the 
cessation of hostilities, we were in 
the city of Metz, evacuating wound- 
ed American and Allied prisoners 
of war. As you will no doubt 
recall, in October, 1918, the 92nd 
Division had been sent to this 
sector, along the Moselle river, in 
front of Metz, its front line defense 
varying from ten to fourteen kilo- 
meters. Metz had been selected by 
General Pershing as the next important 
objective of the American Army and 
the Buffaloes had been selected to take 
it. The Buffaloes were to push along 
both banks of the river in the direction 
of Corny. Metz, because of its strategic 
position, was a base of the German 
army and most powerfully manned by 
heavy guns, trench mortars, numerous 
machine guns. Its - approach was 
heavily wired, trenched, mined and 
fortified in concrete. Thousands of 
the French had died here in this war 
and in previous wars and the “‘poilu” 


thought this fortress impregnable. 

Now, ten years later, we are along 
this same route. Coming suddenly to 
the crest of a hill as we drive along, 
we look down upon fertile valleys, lit- 
tle villages clustered here and there. 
What a change! Gone are the hellish 
implements of war. Instead plows. 
This time our course along the valley 
is the same, except that we are com- 
ing from Metz toward Pont A’Mous- 
son, and our trip, instead of being 
made in a shell-marked army ambu- 
lance, is in two dilapidated Ford taxis, 
one driven by an Alsatian who had 
served with the German army and the 
other by an “ex-poilu.” 


ETZ, as you know, is in Alsace- 
Lorraine and has been restored 
to French rule. It has lost, it appeared 
to us, much of its modern-city-atmos- 
phere, which we noted on our first 
visit. Even in 1918 it appeared to us 
as one of the most modern and thriving 
cities that we had seen in France. We 
had not been to Paris then. Metz is 
not a tourist ‘center and the Grand 
Hotel where we resided—and by the 
way, we were informed by the con- 
cierge that the suite that we occupied 
had been occupied by the Kaiser on 
his numerous visits to the Metz front 
—was almost empty. 

From Metz we followed the banks 
of the Moselle through Ancy-sur-Mos- 
elle to Corny—the objective of the 
“Buffaloes” on that last drive; thence 
to Noveant-sur-Moselle. It was to 
Noveant that the Ist Battalion of the 
367th Infantry moved after those fu- 
rious days of fighting to establish a 
frontier guard for the Allies. We 
visited the houses in which had been 
Battalion headquarters and the medi- 
cal corps headquarters. Its winding 
streets are just as narrow and muddy, 
but now it is occupied by unfamiliar 
faces; then it was an abandoned shell 
torn town behind the German lines. 
It was here that the Germans main- 
tained an underground hospital, fully 
equipped and abundantly supplied. 


ROM Noveant we went through 

Arnaville to Pagny-sur-Moselle. 
Here as elsewhere the shell-torn fields 
are under cultivation and only now 
and then did we come upon a house 
that had not been rehabilitated, its 
stone chimney and partly demolished 
walls standing ghost-like, silhouetted 
on the skyline, a grim reminder of the 
past. As we approached Pagny,

A Symposium 


I AM FOR HOOVER 


Because— 
IS life exemplifies the great Amer- 
ican opportunity thrown open to 
every boy. Here was a farmer lad of 
humble parentage who by force of 
character, unflagging determination and 
devotion to ideals became one of the 
world’s great leaders. 
Because— 

His experience in ministering to war 
sufferers and flood sufferers have re- 
vealed his broad sympathies for all 
mankind. 

Because— 

In the one instance in which he had 
an opportunity to serve the people of 
our group he did it without hesitation 
and without pressure. When he took 
charge of the Mississippi Flood Relief 
Committee he stated to a group of col- 
ored men that race and color did not 
enter into the relief program. That 
human lives were to be saved and 
whether they be black or white the full 
resources of their organization would 
be thrown into the breach to help. The 
record for the Mississippi Flood Relief 
work will stand in the minds of mil- 
lions of colored people as a testimonial 
of Herbert Hoover’s willingness to ad- 
minister any high office without dis- 
crimination and with even-handed jus- 
tice. 

Because— 

In his speech of acceptance he em- 
phasized the great need in America for 
equal opportunity for every one, and if 
he is elected President it is my candid, 
frank, and deliberate opinion that he 
will be the President of all of the peo- 
ple and will give the full prestige of his 
high office to that program of “equal 
opportunity” for every American citi- 
zen.

Republican Colored V oters Division. 


SMITH 


HE election of Governor Smith 

would be a fine victory for the 
cause of tolerance and fair play in 
America. The moral tone of the whole 
nation would be better for such a tri- 
umph ; and every American who suffers 
from the effects of religious bigotry and 
racial hatreds would be a beneficiary. 
The Negro could not be denied par- 
ticipation in these benefits, for the 
quickened ethical perceptions of the 
nation—of which such a victory would 
be a definite indication—would make 
such exclusion impossible. The col- 
ored voter realizes this. 


368 


also that it would be a serious blow to 
the cause of his race if such a victory 
should be achieved without his having 
made a substantial contributicn to it. 
For the first time since his enfranchise- 
ment, the colored voter is confronted 
with an opportunity at a national elec- 
tion to use his suffrage for the adance- 
ment of his own cause. For the cause 
of tolerance and fair play is essentially 
his cause. I earnestly hope and firmly 
believe that at this election colored 
voters in overwhelming numbers will 
be found in the ranks of those Ameri- 
cans who are resolved to banish for- 
ever from this Nation religious bigotry 
and racial hatred. 

Incalculable good will come to the 
Negro in this country if he does, by 
giving his suffrage to the Democratic 
candidate for President, prove he is 
conscious of his duty and obligation as 
an American citizen. Even in the 
South, where he feels most keenly the 
effects of racial prejudice, he will bene- 
fit. There the liberal Democrats are 
leading the fight for Governor Smith, 
while on the other hand Bourbon Re- 
actionary Democrats and the Lily 
white Republicans are fighting the 
battle of the Republican candidate. It 
is the liberal Democrat in the South 
to whom the Negro must look for fair 
play. This election affords the Negro 
voter in the North an opportunity 
never before enjoyed by him to help 
his brother in the South. It is ob- 
vious that if we in the North and West 
help to elect the Democratic candidate 
for President, the liberal Democrats 
in the South must inevitably, as a re- 
sult of such action on our part, feel 
more kindly toward the Negro there. 

The intelligent colored American 
realizes that the Negro problem, so- 
called, is no longer a national political 
issue. He knows that colored people 
in this country must fight out their 
destiny in the localities where they live. 
Nearly half of the colored people in 
the United States now reside north of 
the Mason Dixon Line. There they 
are confronted by new problems and 
new conditions. If they make intelli- 
gent use of their suffrage in their new 
homes, there will never arise in the 
North the problem that still confronts 
the South. In the great cities and in- 
dustrial centers of the North, we must 
make common cause politically with 
the workers with whom we are identi- 
fied industrially and economically. The 
great majority of these workers realize 
that their interests will be best served 
by the election of Governor Smith and 


He realizes they are supporting his candidacy. If 


we are to survive industrially and ego. 
nomically in the North, we must have 
the good will of the working classes, 
We can do much to gain this good will 
by helping to elect Governor Smith, the 
candidate for President, whose elec. 
tion will best serve the interest and 
welfare of the working people. 

As long as the Negro vote is the 
property of one political party, he can 
not use it to his own advantage. He 
can use it to his own advantage only 
if he divides it. In the coming elec. 
tion, colored voters should give their 
suffrage to Governor Smith if for no 
other reason than to establish the fact 
that they are politically independent, 
The ballot is the most potent weapon 
we have in our fight for the recogni- 
tion of our constitutional rights. We 
must use this weapon. If we prove 
at this election that we are conscious 
of the power of our ballot and regard 
it as our own property and not the 
property of the Republican party, we 
shall not only carn the respe:. of the 
Nation, but we shall place ourselves in 
a position of strategic advaniage polit- 
ically.

THOMAS 

AM going to vote for Norman 

Thomas. I am going to vote for 
the Socialist Ticket. I vote for 
Thomas because he is a fine upstanding 
man who has not been afraid to cham- 
pion the unpopular cause, and laying 
aside a clear opportunity to be well-to- 
do and respectable, he has taken the 
more difficult road of working for the 
emancipation of the laboring classes. 
He recognizes the Negro as a part of 
the laboring class, and while he has 
not said much, distinctly and clearly, 
about the colored races and their tre- 
mendous significance for industrial 
democracy, he has said something, and 
that is more than either Smith or 
Hoover, Hughes or Harding. Cox or 
Wilson ever did. But after all, the 
chief reason for voting for Thomas is 
that he is a Socialist. Many men un- 
derstand many things under Socialism, 
but I understand an attempt to re 
arrange work and industry, wages and 
income, on a basis of reason, need and 
desert, rather than leaving them to 
chance and the rule of the strong, as 
is the case today over so large a part 
of the world. I do not pretend to know 
as to just how this can be accomplished 
but I insist that we must try to do it

COLOR DISCRIMINATION IN 
GOVERNMENT SERVICE 


OR many years there has been pro- 

test and complaint about the treat- 
ment of colored Americans in the Civil 
Service at Washington, D. C. It has 
always, however, been difficult to make 
these charges definite. First, because 
the discrimination itself is indefinite 
and changes from administration to 
administration, and from year to year. 
Secondly, because it is hard to get re- 
liable testimony. Those clerks who 
are already discriminated against are 
not anxious to invite further discrim- 
ination or even dismissal by making 
public complaint. 

There has always been more or less 
color discrimination in Government 
Service. Before Emancipation there 
were no Negro employees except mes- 
sengers and laborers. During Recon- 
struction when Negroes began to enter 
the Civil Service, they were by common 
consent or express order, segregated in 
parts of rooms or in rooms by them- 
selves. Appointments in the Civil Ser- 
vice, even after reformed methods and 
examinations came in, were gifficult to 
obtain by colored applicants. 

Then, as the political influence of 
Negroes increased and trained colored 
applicants appeared, a larger number 
were appointed and it was more dif- 
ficult to maintain racial discrimination. 
During the administrations of Cleve- 
land, Harrison and McKinley race dis- 
crimination in government  depart- 
ments was at a minimum. The ad- 
vent of the Wilson Administration 
in 1913 marked a determined ef- 
tort to put Negro Civil Service Ser- 
vants “in their places”. It is rumored 
that the first Mrs. Woodrow Wilson 


started the effort when she discovered 


Miss Velma White

November, 1928 














“Miss California” 
Miss Rosalind De Priest, $511 


that white and Negro clerks were eat- 
ing together in some instances. After 
the Wilson Administration, in some 
cases, the Republicans increased the 
segregation, and in other cases they 
gave it up. The large number of 
clerks employed during the war 
brought in new color contacts and 
problems. 


T present, two separate investi- 
gations made by the National As- 
sociation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People, give the following situa- 
tion, which seems to be as near an ap- 
proximation of the truth as it is pos- 
sible to get. 
As to general. color discrimination, 
there are the following facts:

(1) Applicants for Civil Service 
positions are required to furnish a pho- 
tograph. There are many reasons for 
this but there can be little doubt that 
the chief consequence is to enable the 
appointing power to weed out colored 
applicants. This has been openly 
acknowledged in many cases, and espe- 
cially in such cases as those where the 
applicants did not look “colored” in 
their photographs. 

(2) There is much unfair treat- 
ment in matters of rating and promo- 
tion. As, for instance, in the Wash- 
ington City Post Office, white carriers 
get preferred routes and Negro clerks 
are never assigned to window duty or 
promoted beyond the grade of Special 
Clerk. They are never made Foremen 
or Assistant Foremen. In the Burean 


of Engraving and Printing no colored... 


woman has ever been appointed to the 
clerical staff, although there is no ques- 
tion but what they could do the work. 
There are probably other cases of this 
sort. 

‘Specific cases of open discrimination 
are not as widespread or as flagrant as 
they have been in the past or as many 
people have been led to believe. There 
is apparently no discrimination in the 
Departments of Agriculture, Depart- 
ment of Labor, or the State Depart- 
ment. There seems to be little, if any, 
in the War Department, and although 
there used to be a whole segregated 
wing of colored clerks in the Census 
Bureau, this has been abolished, and 
no segregation is apparent there today. 

In some of these cases there is no 
segregation because there are either no 
colored clerks at all or very few. On 
the other hand, there are cases where 
white and colored clerks in appreciable

The Dunbar National Bank 


HE Dunbar National Bank was 

opened in Harlem in September. 
It is located in the Dunbar Apartments 
at 2824 Eighth Avenue and 150th 
Street. It has a capital and surplus 
of over a million dollars, and the 
Board of Directors is white, with the 
exception of Mr. Roscoe C. Bruce, 
Resident Manager of the Dunbar 
Apartments. The bank is conducted 
by three technical experts who are 
white: the President being Joseph D. 
Higgins; the Vice President, Arthur 
H. Thien; and the Cashier, George S. 
Loomis. 

The operating staff is entirely Ne- 
gro: the Paying Teller is Garnet R. 
Waller, who for ten years has been 
in the employ of H. O. Wilson, a col- 
ored banker of Baltimore. Before 
that, he was in government work dur- 
ing the war, and was employed by the 
Mutual Benefit Society. He is the 


son of the Reverend Garnet R. Wal- 
ler, a Baptist minister of Springfield, 
Massachusetts, and one of the Direc- 
tors of the N, A. A. C. P. 

The Receiving Teller is Cyril A. 
Wilson, who was born in Barbados, 
and who has been for the past six 
years employed by the Seaboard Na- 
tional Bank in various capacities, the 
last of which was that of Assistant 
Receiving Teller. 

The Bookkeeper is John P. 
Quander, Jr., who was formerly 
Auditor of the Black Swan Phono- 
graph Company and the Northeastern 
Life Insurance Company. He was in 
the Quarter Master Department dur- 
ing the war and for twelve years was 
in the Philippine Constabulary. 

In charge of Thrift Accounts is 
Miss Mae C. Hawes, a graduate of 
Atlanta University, and a Master of 
Arts of Columbia. She was formerly 
employed by the National Council of 


the Y. W. C. A. Mrs. Bernice Wolfe- 
Greene is Stenographer; Mr. Joshua 
H. Williams, in charge of the Safety 


Vault; Lieutenant John A. McDon- 
ald of the 369th Infantry, is Special 
Patrolman, Mr. William B. Smith. 


Night Watchman, and Mi. 
Williams, Messenger. 


HE object of this arrangement ot 

the bank’s officers and employees, 
is stated by persons in authority as 
follows: 

(1) “The present organization and 
personnel of the Bank are such as to 
place the institution at once upon the 
most cordial and helpful terms with 
the other financial institutions of the 
City, a matter of vital import. 

(2) “Under three technical ex- 
perts,—the President, the Vice-Presi- 
dent, the Cashier,—the Negro operat- 
ing staff can and will receive the best 
possible training in the exacting tech- 
nique of banking under New York 
City conditions. 

(3) “The advancement without 
limit of any Negro employee depends 
entirely upon his own comparative 
character, ability and devotion.”

Calendar Chat 

HAVE written many times about 

the Norway spruce hedge on the 
north side of a yard that was so long 
“home” to me. The hedge was planted 
there in the same year that the 
American soldiers were sailing off to 
fight in Cuba. That was in 1898, a 
long time ago. But the hedge is barely 
more than five feet tall, for it is cut 
every spring. June and July of this 
year found the catbirds nesting and 
hovering there, though I have always 
consigned this hedge to the song spar- 
rows in my mind. ‘They used to mo- 
nopolize it. But at this autumn season 
more than the birds are finding refuge 
there. The rabbits are diving under it 
to yet away from the hunters. 


These little creatures of all those 
wonderful tales, far older than Uncle 
Remus’s, have had joyous gambols over 
people’s yards and gardens this sum- 
mer and had many terrible crimes 
charged to them by the farmers. Indeed 
they were in the sweet pea beds at the 
home place nibbling and shaking off the 
dainty scarlet and lavender and pink 
blooms. I would catch them there 
early in the morning when they

thought the world belonged to them 
and the quail. But autumn is hide 
and seek time and the hunted life is 
dreading mankind. 

Autumn meant for us children nut 
hunting. We would go after black 
walnuts. Some of the black walnut 
wood had furnished gunstocks for the 
rabbit hunters, by the way. We used 
to take the green husks off without any 
thought of stained fingers and lay the 
nuts out in the warm autumn sun to 
season. When they were ripe and 
rich we would make candy of them as 
Mexicans make their pecan candy and 
as people of South Carolina make what 
they call “pinder cakes” of peanuts. 


Turkeys 


E knew that it really wasn’t the 
right thing to do, to “cut 
through the seminary yard.” Yet it 
seemed such a convenient route, espe- 
cially when one was a little late for 
school. So we frequently used the 
small path beaten by many another 
trespasser to speed through the open- 
ing in the osage fence that marked the 
end of the trail. 
But often the short cut meant un-

pleasant adventure. A _ turkey lived 
in the seminary yard and grazed about 
as though he owned the grounds. He 
would charge upon travelers at his 
pleasure and keep children in constant 
dread. To us he seemed immense. 
His legs were so long and purposeful. 
We would be hurrying through the | 
yard when he would strut out with 
powerful strides and aim straight for 1 
use. He would spread his great fan 
tail and swing it slightly while his 
wings brushed the ground. Worst of 


all was his “Gobble, gobble, gobble.” 'y

was a cook in the seminary and owner | 
of the dreaded turkey. ta 

The wild turkeys that the Pilgrim 
Fathers feasted upon in New England 
were larger than Mr. Parker’s fowl. 
They used to trail through the woods 
in great hosts and dine upon tender if 
young frogs and grass and grain and 
seeds and fruit. The fledglings en-

THE BROWSING READER 


The Walls of Jericho.” A Novel by 
Rudolph Fisher, Knopf. $2.50. 


HIS is another story of Harlem, 

following the footsteps of “Nigger 
Heaven” and “Home to Harlem.” 
The casual reader wading through the 
first third of the book might think it 
nothing else but a following of these 
pathfinders into the half-world north 
of 125th Street. But a little persistence 
and a knowledge of what Rudolph 
Fisher has already accomplished in his 
remarkable short stories, will bring 
reward. For the main story of a piano 
mover and a housemaid is a well done 
and sincere bit of psychology. It is 
finely worked out with a delicate 
knowledge of human reactions. If the 
background were as sincere as the main 
picture, the novel would be a master- 
piece. But the background is a shade 
too sophisticated: and unreal. Mr. 
Fisher likes his two characters, Jinx 
and Bubber, and lingers over them; 
but somehow, to the ordinary reader, 
they are only moderately funny, a 
little smutty and certainly not humanly 
convincing. Their conversation has 
some undoubted marks of authenticity, 
for this kind of keen repartee is often 
heard among Negro laborers. But 
neither of these characters seems human 
like Shine. 

Mr. Fisher does not yet venture to 
write of himself and his own people; 
of Negroes like his mother, his sister 
and his wife. His real Harlem friends 
and his own soul nowhere yet appear 
in his pages, and nothing that can be 
mistaken for them. The glimpses of 
better class Negroes which he gives us 
are poor, ineffective make-believes. One 
wonders why? Why does Mr. Fisher 
fear to use his genius to paint his own 
kind, as he has painted Shine and 
Linda? Perhaps he doubts the taste 
of his white audience although he tries 
it severely with Miss Cramp. Per- 
haps he feels too close to his own to 
trust his artistic detachment in limn- 
ing them. Perhaps he really laughs 
at all life and believes nothing. At 
any rate, here is a step upward from 
Van Vechten and McKay—a strong, 
long, interesting step. We hope for 
others.

BOOKS 


American Negro authors have 
published over 20 important 
books in the last two years. 
White authors have written 15 
books about Negroes which Ne- 
groes ought to read. Periodicals 
are filled with articles on the Ne- 
gro in the United States, the 
West Indies, and Africa. How 
many of these books do you own? 
How many of these periodicals 
are on your table? Why not 
write immediately to THE CRISIS 
and secure lists and prices? 
Christmas is coming. 


These two books come to us to add 
needed knowledge among American 
Negroes of the West Indies. They 
have, of course, the difficulty of all 
books written and published in the 
West Indies: they ignore the color 
line so elaborately that one seldom 
knows when they are talking of col- 
ored people and when they are talking 
of white people. Nevertheless, if one 
remembers that the vast majority of 
those who live in the West Indies are 
of acknowledged or unacknowledged 
Negro descent, there is much informa- 
tion that one can gain. 

A correspondent writes: “As you 
will see by the ‘Handbook’, we are 
now pretty widely known as one of the 
greatest winter resorts in the world, 
and thousands of people come in from 
all over. But unfortunately very few 
Negroes. And being so closely asso- 
ciated with the United States, I am 
sure that if we were better known 
among the travelling element of our 
race, we would get quite a few repre- 
sentative Negroes here from time to 
time. And anything that you may be 
able to publish from the books sent up 
by me in Tue Crisis, from time to 
time, showing the advantages to be had 
by spending a vacation in the Bahamas, 
would be greatly appreciated. This 
summer we have had for the first time, 
the ‘Colored Embalmers Association’ 
to meet here.” 


“Black Democracy.” The Story of 
Haiti. By H. P. Davis. New 
York. MacVeagh, 1928. 


HIS is a curious work. To un- 
derstand it something of the back- 
_ground of the author and the circum- 
stances of his writing must be known. 


gs 


For thirteen years H. P. Davis has 
been an open or secret agent of the 
American Government in Haiti. Dyr. 
ing the Great War he headed a cop. 
tract to furnish castor oil beans, but 
at the end of the War the contract 
was canceled for a large sum, which 
went to certain firms which he repre. 
sented in the United States. Mr. 
Davis was then without work and up. 
doubtedly suffered often at the hands 
of the American officials. His atti- 
tude is, therefore, the attitude of one 
who believes in American domination 
in Haiti, but wishes to Supplant the 
present military occupation. Perhaps 
Mr. Davis himself would like to be 
High Commissioner. 

He has, therefore, undertaken to 
write a history of Haiti to prove his 
thesis and forward his claims. He is 
not an historian, but his book is read- 
able, and on the whole, favorable to 
the Haitian people. Nevertheless, it 
has serious defects. ‘The first part of 
140 pages runs from earliest times to 
1908. The story here is sympathetic 
ally told, but unconsciously or pur- 
posely, Mr. Davis is led far astray in 
his estimates of certain great leaders, 
particularly Dessalines. Evidently he 
has taken his picture of Dessalines from 
the French. And of all the Haitian 
leaders, Dessalines has been hated most 
by the whites because he was their 
most terrible enemy. It is not true 
that Dessalines massacred 10,000 mu- 
lattoes, and it was his generous treat- 
ment of his adversaries that made pos- 
sible the united front of the Haitians 
during the war for independence. Out- 
side of some unfortunate lapses like 
this, there is no doubt but that Mr. 
Davis has tried to write an impartial 
history, and he tells again the story of 
Haiti’s unselfish help of South 
America: 

“Haiti did, however, give a hearty 
welcome to Simon Bolivar and many 
Venezuelan families driven into exile 
by the Spaniards in 1816. Petion ex- 
tended to them all the assistance in his 
power and secretly equipped Bolivar 
with rifles, powder, cartridges, and all 
kinds of provisions. Petion was moved 
to this dangerous and generous action 
by his sincere desire to assist in freeing 
the slaves of South America, and Boli- 
var promised to abolish slavery in all 
provinces he might liberate. After 
freeing Venezuela, Bolivar sent Petion 
his beautiful gold sword, in gratitude 
to ‘the author of our liberties.’ ”

@ Dr. E. Elliot Rawlins, one of Har- 
lem’s best known physicians, died re- 
cently in New York City. Dr. Raw- 
lins was born’45 years ago in the island 
of St. Kitts, B. W. 1., and was brought 


as a child to New York City, where he 
studied in the public schools. In 1905 
he received his medical degree from the 
Long Island College and Hospital. 

@ Carl Diton has just completed an 
extraordinary tour. Leaving Phila- 
delphia last October with his wife, he 
made a 9 months’ tour of 33,000 miles 
in his automobile. He sang, played, 
lectured, and gave organ recitals in 
140 different concerts. Mr. Diton’s 
program consisted of classical groups 
by Scarlatti, Montevarde, Handel and 
others, German and Austrian lieder 
songs by Debussy, and other French 
masters, modern English songs and 
Negro songs and spirituals. Mr. Diton 
plans a European tour this fall. 

@ Hal Roach’s “Our Gang” is tour- 
ing the United States. ‘Farina’, the 
small colored star, is with them. Be- 
cause the Roosevelt Hotel, New York 
City, refused to accommodate ‘‘Fa- 
rina’, the “gang” took residence at the 
Park Central Hotel.

@ In 1916, Thomas Jesse Jones of the 
Phelps Stokes Fund, conducted for the 
Bureau of Education a study of the 
private and higher schools for colored 
people in the United States. In 1927, 
the Bureau of Education has sent out 
advance notice of a second survey. In 
1916, there were 31 Negro institutions 
with college work, having 2,132 Negro 
students, and an income of $2,283,000. 
In 1927, there were 77 colleges, with 
13,680 students and an annual income 
of $8,560,000. In 1916, the value of 
the physical plants was $15,720,000, 
which had increased to $38,680,000 in 
1927, Productive endowments had in- 
creased from $7,225,000, yielding 
$361,250 annually, to $20,713,000, 
yielding $1,071,300. 

@ This Survey was conducted by the 
State Departments of Education in 19 
states with the co-operation of 79 Ne-

@ The Department of Labor has is-

ployed by the United States Govern- 
ment. In 1910, there were 22,940 em- 
ployees with salaries aggregating $12,- 
456,760. In 1928, June 30th, there 
were 51,882 employees receiving $64,- 
483,133. The chief number employed 
are as follows: 


Post Office Department, 25,390. 

The War Department, 5,914. 

The Navy Department, 5,427. 

The Treasury Department, 5,407. 
District of Columbia Government, 3,674.

@ The Reverend John H. Lewis has 
resigned his position as president of 
Morris Brown University, located at 
Atlanta, Ga. Mr. Lewis, who has 
been at Morris Brown for eight years, 
gives as his reason for resignation the 
unfortunate financial condition of the 
institution which prevents the realiza- 
tion of its ideals. 

@ The Commission on_ Inter-racial 
Co-operation in Atlanta is offering to 
High School students three cash prizes, 
aggregating $100 for papers on “Amer- 
ica’s Tenth Man”. High School pu- 
pils are eligible. The object is to en- 
courage a study of the Negro’s part 
in American history.

@ Mrs. Mary M. Bethune writes 
that it is impossible to tell of the de- 
struction and suffering among colored 
people in Florida as a result of the 
hurricane: “Suffice it to say that the 
lower East Coast of Florida lies pros- 
trated. Delray, Pleasant City, Palm 
Beach, West Palm Beach. Canal 
Point, Bellglade, Panoke, ail have 
been seriously struck. Never before 
in my life have I witnessed such suf- 
fering, and so many homeless people. 
The Coast has been raked and scraped 
from Pompano to Stuart. The storm 
was the most violent ever known in 
that section. In its rage, it brought all 
persons down to a common level of 
mutual help. Little has been left of 
the homes and business places of the 
Negroes in West Palm Beach. School 
houses have been destroyed—every 
church, save one, in the entire city, is 
demolished. All of the public build- 
ings are destroyed. ... The distress 
among the poor people in the ever- 
glades is great. They were drowned 
by the hundreds. Great trucks— 
heaped high with dead bodies—white 
and black—men, women and children, 
were buried without being identified— 
many of them having no one left to 
identify them. Steam shovels were 
used in the colored and white ceme- 
teries to dig the trenches in which this 
great mass of stricken humanity was 
laid to rest.”

@ D. J. Wallace, director of the Se- 
curity Life Insurance Go., and an at- 
torney of Okmulgee, Okla., died re- 
cently at that city at the age of 70 
years. 

@ Ministers and laymen from forty- 
eight states took part in the 49th an- 
nual session of the National Baptist 
Convention of America, which con- 
vened in Shreveport, La., early in 
September. Over $300,000 in busi- 
ness during the past fiscal year was 
reported by the Publishing House as 
the gross operation of the institution. 
This is an increase of more than $20,- 
000 over the year 1926-27. 

@ A new colored high school build- 
ing, modern in every respect and cost- 
ing $45,000, was opened in North 
Little Rock, Ark., in September. In 
keeping with the custom of naming 
school buildings in honor of some not- 
able citizen, the school board named 
the school the Scipio A. Jones High 
School. 

( An investigation of the penal sys- 
tem of Texas has revealed the fact 
that 4,000 prisoners, most of them Ne- 
gro workers, are ruled by whip and 
blood-hound terror on the prison farms 
of that state. This is true of the 
main penitentiary at Huntsville as 
well as the twelve prison farms. If a 
convict does not work as hard as the 
guard thinks he should, he is given 
solitary confinement on dry bread and 
water. When he returns to work, if 
he is too weak to work as hard as 
formerly, he is bound to a post and 
lashed with a heavy thong. 


THE PACIFIC AND MOUN- 
TAIN STATES 


@ The Inter-racial Committee of 
San Diego, Calif., and The Little 
Gallery, held its first exhibition of 
contemporary Negro art in San Diego 
on September 16th. 

@ A protracted fight against colored 
citizens of Los Angeles, Calif., occupy- 
ing residences in the exclusive Crest- 
more residential district terminated re- 
cently when the State Supreme Court 
ruled that Negroes might buy property 
ir the area, but they could not occupy 
it. 

@ Frederick M. Roberts, a colored 
man, was re-nominated for a_ sixth 
term in the California Legislature in 
the recent primary elections. In all of 
the precincts known as the “colored’”’ 
precincts, Assemblyman Roberts was 
the choice over his opponent by major- 
ities ranging from two to one to more 
than three to one. 


THE WEST INDIES 
@ Silvio Cator of Haiti, runner-up at 
Amsterdam in the Olympic broad 
jump, broke the world’s record for 
that event in an international meet 
held at Paris, when he leaped 7.93 
metres, or 26 feet 27/128 inch. 
@ The Virgin Islands Fish Indus- 
tries, Inc., with headquarters at St. 
Thomas, and with a capital of $15,000, 
has been organized by a group of citi- 
zens who have been studying the unde- 
veloped resources of the Virgin Islands. 
@ Cuba’s foremost poet, Vincenta Sil- 
veira Arjona, Negro, died recently at 


his home in Oouajay, Cuba. Mr: Ar-

literature for more than three decades. 


SOUTH AFRICA 


@ The South African Native College 
under the Presidency of D. D. T. 
Jabavu, B. A. (London), is situated 
at Fort Hare, Alice, Cape Province, 
South Africa. It was established by 
the natives after long effort and is 
recognized as an official part of the 
University of South Africa. At the 
last Commencement, May 30th, the 
College for the first time, presented 
candidates for degrees, and H. M. 
Scott, Director of Education in the 
Transvaal Province, bestowed the fol- 
lowing degrees: Gertrude N. Ntlabati, 
Bachelor of Arts; Benjamin Mahlasela, 
Bachelor of Arts; Donald Guy Sidney 
Mtimkulu, Bachelor of Arts. Mr. 
Scott said in conferring the degrees: 
“This ceremony to-day is more mem- 
orable than those which have preceded 
it for two reasons. In the first place 
the standard of attainment reached 
marks a higher level than has ever 
been reached before and we must con- 
gratulate not only the student con- 
cerned but also the Institution. More- 
over the day is particularly memorable 
because I have just conferred in the 
name of the University a degree upon 
‘ woman of the Native races and this 
is the first time that a woman has won 
this distinction in South Africa.”

THE FAR HORIZON 


THE “SOLID IVORY” SOUTH 
HE CRISIS is delighted over the 


political situation in the South. 
We admit that our delight is schaden- 
freude, meanness, and all that. Never- 
theless, we ask if anyone can read the 
painfully conceived editorial below and 
not feel an inclination to snicker, and 
perhaps even to whoop. It is from our 
old friend, the Charleston, South Caro- 
lina, News and Courier: 


The Southern states will vote for 
Smith and Robinson. Whatever the dis- 
affection, whatever the spirit of resent- 
ment, whatever the pain on the part of 
devoted prohibitionists, they will sup- 
port the Democratic ticket, because they 
must. Their good sense will convince 
them of it. 

The presence of the Negroes as poten- 
tial voters ties the prohibitionists to the 
Democratic party. In South Carolina 
are now about 875,000 Negroes and 
about 925,000 whites. 

The white people cannot divide into 
two parties without letting many Negro 
voters into both. If the Negroes are 
used as voters they will be used as office- 
holders. 

Since Mr. Taft took office in 1908, 
the Southern white people have not been 
harassed by Republican administrations 
with appointments of Negroes, and a 
frame of mind has been induced upon 
them that this menace to their safety 
and peace has been wholly removed. 

What they have forgotten is that in 
this same twenty years the contacts of 
the federal government with the private 
affairs and interests of the citizens have 
been multiplied by ten or twenty. They 
forgot what might take place when they 
ratified the Eighteenth amendment and 
their congressmen voted for the Vol- 
stead act. They forgot that, one day, 
Negroes might be appointed as federal 
prohibition enforcers. The Volstead act 
is a “force bill.” 

Federal prohibition agents are federal 
police officers. 

In South Carolina are about 200,000 
Negroes of voting age. If 50,000 of 
them vote the Republican ticket, they 
will demand their rewards and will re- 
ceive them. Some of them will be ap- 
pointed to office. That statment proves 
itself. Probably, in Northern cities, are 
a few Negro prohibition agents now. 

In South Carolina there is not a Pro- 
hibition Democrat who would be willing 
for the home of a suspected “wet” to be 
raided by a Negro agent. Nor would 
he have white men and white women in 
automobiles subject to be halted and 
searched by colored men. 

In Mr. Taft’s administration there 
was no federal income tax, no collectors 
and auditors looking into the citizen’s 


380 


books. There was no Harrison narcotic 
act, with federal enforcers, in those days. 

In these twenty years laws have been 
passed whereby the federal government 
enters, at will, into every man’s and 
every woman’s kitchen, office, store, bed- 
room, bathroom. Its agents tap the 
telephone wires and eavesdrop a con- 
versation at a man’s fireside if it is their 
wish. It is their right. The supreme 
court so has decided. 

Twenty years ago the federal govern- 
ment seldom touched the average man. 
A few deputy collectors raided a few 
mountain moonshiners, the collector of 
the port here had to do with shippers, 
and other people would scarcely have 
known by personal association that there 
was a federal government except from 
the postoffice. 

All that is changed now. “Uncle 
Sam” walks with us arm in arm. He 
crosses his legs under our tables. When 
he is in good humor he is a welcome 
guest, but when he is prying he isn’t. 

The News and Courier has no de- 
light in talking about the Negro question; 
its disposition toward the Negroes is 
not unkind, but we have got to keep the 
Negroes out of government in the South 
or get out of the South ourselves. 

The federal government having be- 
come intimate with all of us, having 
taken a seat in the family circle, which 
it did not do formerly, it is for the South 
to watch. . 

If the whites divide, the Negroes vote. 

If the Negroes vote, they get a share 
of the offices. 

Prohibition agents and income tax 
deputies are federal officers. 

These officers get closer to us than do 
other officers. 

The Southern white prohibitionists 
will turn against national prohibition 
and vote for a “wet” candidate for presi- 
dent, pledged to uphold the right of each 
-state to deal with the liquor traffic ques- 
tion in its own way, before they will take 
the chance of creating an angry division 
of the white people and having the South 
infested with Negro prohibition agents 
and income tax investigators. 

Of course the South will vote for 
Smith and Robinson. 


The spectacle of a South Carolina 
colored gentlemen inspecting a white 


Colonel’s baggage for liquor reduces 
us darn near to tears. 


PREJUDICE 
R. HARRY EMERSON FOS- 


DICK preached a sermon some- 
time ago on Prejudice. Parts of it 
are worth quoting: 

When, therefore, today you hear a 
man say, “I hate Jews, Roman Catho- 
lics, Japanese, Negroes,” you are deal- 


R 


ing with a belated mind. That man may 
dress like a modern, ride in an automo. 
bile, listen over the radio, but his ming 
is properly dated about a thousand B. (. 
Long ago those ancient isolations and 
barricades began to break down. Long 
ago the Roman Empire poured them into 
a melting pot and the Christian church 
organized them into a spiritual kingdom, 
Long ago science, giving us new means 
of communication and multiplied cop. 
tacts, tied humanity into one bundle so 
that the only way we now can live well 
is to live well together. Long ago great 
souls like Dante said, “As for us, the 
world is the fatherland,” and yet we 
still have with us belated minds that 
poison our life with prejudice. 

How absurd are some of our prej- 
udiced exclusions! When our friend 
Miss Maude Royden was in this coun- 
try, she attended a convention in the 
South, and somewhat shocked and 
grieved her hosts by choosing a Negro 
church in which to preach; but when a 
dinner was given in her honor she found 
beside her at the table, in the seat of 
second honor, a Eurasian from India. 
She laughed about that. It would have 
seemed dreadful to that company to seat 
her next a Negro, but it would have 
seemed equally dreadful to some of her 
friends in England to have been seated 
next a Eurasian. What fools and blind 
men we are! 

This is why International House on 
Riverside Drive is one of the most stim- 
ulating places on this planet—sixty- 
seven different nations and races under 
one roof. It is a liberal education to 
breathe the air. “But,” some one says, 
“you are dodging the question. You 
are talking about students, I am think- 
ing about the ordinary garden variety of 
people. I don’t want anything to do with 
niggers, Japs, Dagoes, and Jews.” My 
friend, do you see what you are doing? 
You are gathering up a great mass of 
human beings and tagging them with an 
opprobrious epithet. How do you like 
that when people do it to us Americans’ 
Gandhi is said to have told his fellow 
Indians that whatever creed we ma 
profess, our God is always money. Do 
you like that? Do you think it is fair’ 
Would you not want to say, “That is 
true about some Americans, but we are 
not all like that. We are not all 
stamped with the dollar mark.” That 
is, you do not like it when anybody: 
takes us, ties us up in one bundle, and 
plasters us with an opprobrious label. 
"Well, what about the Golden Rule? 

Finally and briefly, think of what 
prejudice does, not simply to ourselves 
but to the prospects of the race. You 
see, somehow or other, these nations, 
races, creeds, and colors must live to 
gether. Science has spoken an infallible

THe Crisis

Fiotacnfe 


ON THE FENCE 

N this prcsidential campaign THE 

Crisis is sitting squarely on the 
fence, naked and unashamed and with- 
out apology. It is certain that either 
Herbert Hoover or Al Smith is going 
to be elected President of the United 
States, and in our humble opinion, it 
does not matter a tinker’s damn which 
of these gentlemen succeed. With 
minor exceptions, they stand for exactly 
the same thing: oligarchy in the 
South; color caste in national office 
holding; and recognition of the rule 
of organized wealth. We do not be- 
lieve that there is a jot or tittle of dif- 
ference between these two men in their 
attitude toward these fundamental mat- 
ters, and we sincerely advise our read- 
ers to vote for neither of them. 

On the other hand, we repeat ad- 
vice which we have given many times 
before: it is of the utmost importance 
that Negro voters register and vote for 
Congressmen who are the friends of 
Industrial Democracy and who do not 
believe in the color bar. A Congress 
filled with men of this sort will do 
much to curb the Bourbon South led 
by Al Smith, or entrenched plutocracy 
represented by Herbert Hoover. 


4 THIRD PARTY 


HE political theory of the Third 

Party in a Republican form of 
Government is that when the two chief 
parties cease to stand for distinct poli- 
cies and principles, one of them will 
disappear, or the two will coalesce, 
and that a Third Party will arise and 
become one of the main contenders 
for the popular vote. In this way, it 
is assumed that there will always be a 
real difference of aim and principle be- 
tween the main political parties. It 
was thus that the Republican Party 
arose and triumphed in the election of 
| In this way the 
English Liberal Party displaced the 
Whigs, and the Labor Party now bids 
fair to displace the Liberals. 

Many Americans place their hopes 
of political reform in the United States 
on the rise of a Third Party which 
will register the fact that the present 

epublican and Democratic parties no 
onger differ in any essential respect. 


November, 1928 


_ failed. 


That both represent the rule of or- 
ganized wealth, and neither of them 
has been willing to take radical ground 
with regard to the tariff, the farmer, 
labor, or the Negro. 

The efforts, however, to organize a 
Third Party movement have not been 
successful. ‘The Populists failed. The 
Socialists failed. The Progressives 
failed. The Farmer-Labor movement 
Many reasons have been ad- 
vanced for these failures, but by com- 
mon consent the real effective reason 
has seldom been discussed and that rea- 
son is in the Solid South: the fact is 
that no party in American politics can 
disappear if it is sure of 136 electoral 
votes. 

This number of votes the Demo- 
cratic Party is practically sure of in the 
Solid South: Virginia, 12; North 
Carolina, 12; Tennessee, 12; South 
Carolina, 9; Georgia, 14; Florida, 6; 
Alabama, 12; Mississippi, 10; Arkan- 
sas, 9; Louisiana, 10; Oklahoma, 10; 
Texas, 20. 

There is a possibility that Tennes- 
see’s 12 votes might now and then be 
cast for the Republican Party and a 
still slimmer possibility of Oklahoma’s 
10, and North Carolina’s 12. For the 
most part, however, a presidential elec- 
tion in the United States has to do only 
with 395 of the 531 electoral votes. 
In order to win an election, a party 
must carry 266 votes. Any Third 
Party, therefore, in the United States 
to be successful would have to find its 
266 votes among the 395 votes. 

It must receive all but 29 of the 
electoral votes of the North and 
West. If it fails to do this, then 
it not only fails to carry the election, 
but it throws the election into the 
hands of the least liberal of the two 
old parties. 

The least libc:al party must be the 
Democratic Pz:iy because that party 
must place its main dependence upon 
the Solid South. The Solid South 
has the greatest percentage of illiteracy, 
the greatest percentage of lynchings 
and lawlessness, the greatest amount of 
religious bigotry, the least liberal laws 
as to labor of men, women and child- 
ren, and is, in fine, because of its eco- 
nomic history, the most backward part 
of the whole nation. It does not make 
any difference how far the Democratic 


Party of the North may be stirred by 
liberal leanings, its very dependence 
upon the Solid South compels it to be 
a reactionary party. We might, of 
course, imagine liberal and radical ele- 
ments among the Democrats making a 
strong appeal to the party and to the 
nation, but could we imagine any such 
political leadership voluntarily relin- 
quishing 136 electoral votes? 

Suppose we represent the electoral 
vote of the United States by the figure 
16, and assume that today this power 
is divided almost evenly between 
Democrats and Republicans, each with 
8 votes. To 4 of these votes, cast by 
the Democrats and representing the 
Solid South, a Third Party could make 
no appeal at all. This would leave 
12 votes open to liberal appeal. As- 
sume that the principles of the Third 
Party are so strong and compelling that 
they convince half of those voters; that 
is, half of those open to conviction. 
What is the result? The result is the 
triumph of the Democratic Party by 
a vote of 7 Democrats, 6 Third Party 
men, and 3 Republicans. This illus- 
trates what is bound to take place as 
long as there is a Solid South. 


W HISPERS 


HE real whispering of this cam- 

paign is not whispers with re- 
gard to Smith’s private character or 
Hoover’s relations with England. It 
is the intense and dramatic silence in 
both the Democratic and Republican 
camps on the Negro vote. The Negro 
vote is essential to the victor in this 
campaign. Smith has no ghost of a 
show unless he can carry it, and any 
large defection of Negroes from 
Hoover would ruin his chances. Yet 
neither candidate dares to court this 
vote or to make any promises, or to 
give the slightest indication that he 
cares to have it. Well and good. This 
is not a sign of our weakness; it shows 
the weakness of a nation so sold to race 
hate that it cannot face the truth. The 
real sufferers in a campaign of this 
sort are those American white people 
who do not realize the desperate ef- 
forts that are being made backstairs, 
sotto voce and under cover to attract 
the franchise of Negro voters. Such 
cheerful idiots are under the impres-

sion that our two million votes are of 
no account. We know better and so 
do the disbursers of the slush funds 
which are being poured out among us 
from both headquarters. Thousands 
of Negroes will sell their votes to the 
highest bidder and millions of whites 
will do the same. That’s the reason 
that an American election costs eight 
open millions of dollars and God alone 
knows how much more. 


THE DUNBAR NATIONAL 
BANK 

HE establishment of the Dunbar 

National Bank in New York 
City, may be simply another bank; 
but it might prove to be an epoch 
making event for the darker races of 
the world. Here is a bank with over 
a million dollars of capital and surplus, 
with a colored and white directorate 
and a colored and white personnel. 
Even though white business men and 
capital predominate in numbers and 
authority, yet the possibilities of such 
an organization are tremendous. 

In the present organization of the 
world in politics and industry the line 
between capital and labor coincides 
roughly to the line between the white 
and darker races. Whatever salvation 
the darker races seek under present 
conditions must be attained through 
their admission to the ranks of capi- 
talists. 

Failing this, they must fight capital 
and modern industry and their fight 
must be primarily racial and not based 
on the intrinsic merits or demerits of 
capitalistic industry. 

Thus two questions face Negroes 
and Chinese and Indians. 

First, is capitalism, as at present or- 
ganized, the best director of work and 
income? Second, can the darker peo- 
ples secure voice and influence in the 
governing councils of modern organ- 
ized capital? These are separate ques- 
tions, but they tend to be one today, 
because organized capital today is al- 
most exclusively in white eontrol. The 
control of capital and credit enables 
the white people of the world to rule 
the world for their own benefit and to 
ignore whenever they so wish, the 
best interests of the colored peoples. 

The leaders of colored thought, 
therefore, are faced by this problem: is 
the whole capitalistic system wrong or 
is the color problem merely the prob- 
lem of securing for the darker people 
proper representation in the centers of 
capitalistic control? This question has 
been variously answered. 

Booker T. Washington in the 
United States, most of the Negro 
leaders of West Africa, and some of 
the leaders of India, have seen salva- 
tion in a chance to share the capitalistic 
control of industry with white Europe 


382 


and America. Others, including the 


Editor of THe Crisis, believe that in- 
dustrial reform must be far more radi- 
cal than this. 


UT no matter what differences of 

opinion arise on this point, so 
long as organized capital excludes Ne- 
groes and other darker folk from its 
counsels and official positions, just so 
long will this people be forced toward 
radical industrial reform. 

It is useless to reply that the capital- 
istic system is always open to individ- 
ual merit. That is not true so far as 
white boys are concerned, and it is a 
fiat lie in the case of black boys. No 
black boy today, no matter what his 
education or ability, has any chance of 
admission and promotion in a white 
bank, insurance company, corporation 
or manufacturing concern. And no 
bank organized by black folk has a 
ghost of a chance to grow to real power 
in a financial world dominated by 
white banks and white captains of in- 
dustry. Indeed, it has become almost 
axiomatic in England and America to 
put no real financial or industrial 
power in the hands of black folk. 

Repeated attempts have been made 
to break over this industrial dead line: 
on the Gold Coast in West Africa in 
connection with the cocoa trade; in the 
establishment of some fifty small Ne- 
gro banks in the United States; in vari- 
ous co-operative movements in Asia 
and Africa ;—none of these movements 
have had any real and conspicuous suc- 
cess. Each one has found itself eventu- 
ally in the masterful grasp of the 
great white capitalistic monopoly. 

It is not too much to say that the 
Dunbar National Bank offers the 
greatest opportunity of modern days 
for something different. One cannot 
think that Mr. John Rockefeller, Jr., 
and his associates have gone into this 
enterprise merely for profit. They 
must have a vision. How wide is that 
vision? It may, of course, be narrow 
and conventional: the training of col- 
ored bank officials, the extension of 
credit to promising small colored enter- 
prises. This would be of value. Eventu- 
ally, it would lead to better banking 
among Negroes and more adventure 
in business. But ultimately, it would 
do little more than to emphasize the 
division among colored people into rich 
and poor, exploiter and exploited, land- 
lord and tenant, employer and em- 
plovee. 


EYOND this. there should be, and 

we sincerely trust there is, a 
wider and broader dream. This dream 
would be to break up the controlling 
caste in organized capitalistic industry; 
to say to the world that the use of 
capital is one of the greatest of mod- 


ern inventions and it must no longer 
be monopolized by white people. We 
are going to train colored people jn 
its use and proper control, and through 
these trained men, we are going to see 
how far it is possible in the United 
States, in the West Indies, and jp 
Africa, to put colored men in contro] 
of capital and credit, and to let them 
develop it, not simply for the profit of 
white people, but for the advancement 
of darker peoples. 

And this is no idle dream. A proper 
use of capital and credit in the cocoa 
raising regions of the Gold Coast of 
Africa would do more to emancipate 
black West Africa and educate and 
uplift Negroes, than any other single 
movement. The West Indies, by far 
the most beautiful part of the new 
world, are today prostrate and en- 
slaved under the heels of absentee 
white capitalists and landlords. They 
could be redeemed if the power of 
capital and credit was put into the 
hands of trained colored men who be- 
lieve or could be led to believe in the 
possibilities of Negro blood. American 
imperialism in Haiti and Central 
America, instead of being carried out 
by ‘““Nigger”-hating Louisianians, could 
be put in the hands of black Americans 
who believe in Haitian freedom and 
independence. 

The seemingly insoluble problems 
of South Africa and of East Africa 
could be mitigated in the same way. 
While in the United States the only 
thing that is going to save organized 
labor and bring true industrial de- 
mocracy, is the abolition of the color 
line in capital and credit. 

We shall look forward then with 
interest to the development of this 
bank. If it adds simply one more bank 
in Harlem to the banks of New York, 
we shall be profoundly disappointed, 
no matter how large its capital and 
how great its dividends. If it takes a 
real step toward an industrial de- 
mocracy which includes the darker 
races, we shall hail it as one of the 
great steps of the 20th Century.

~ The Seal of Approval 


HE General Education Board, after a most careful investiga- 

tion, has given a Half Million Dollars towards the Endow- 
ment Fund of TALLADEGA COLLEGE, (Talladega, Ala.), 
conditioned that the College itself shall match the gift with 
another half million dollars in five years. 


This recognition and the approval of the other great Educa- 
tional Agencies, have come as a result of a quiet efficiency, 
uncompromising standards and actual results in the field of higher 
education. 





“Talladega College proved to be a great surprise to me. I was 
not prepared to find an institution with buildings and equipment 
equal to those of many of our better known Northern institutions. 
* * * Talladega College stands as one of the foremost of the 
Negro Colleges, with curricula, teaching, buildings, and equip- 
ment fairly comparable with those of the standard colleges for 
whites in all parts of the country.” — Clarence Linton, Secretary 
of Teachers College, Columbia University. 





Talladega College has a plant worth one and one-half millions 
of dollars. 


A gift towards this Endowment Fund represents a gilt-edge 
investment in Negro Welfare.

The Trail of the Buffaloes 
(Continued from page 367) 


through this tranquil valley, the still- 
ness was almost as appalling now as 
was the continued patter of machine 
guns during the hostilities. We re- 
called most vividly that Sunday and 
Monday of November 10th, and 11th, 
1918, when the ist Battalion, 367th 
Infantry—the original Buffaloes—went 
into action through that unsheltered 
stretch known as the “Death Valley.” 
It was exposed to heavy German guns 
and machine guns, but it held the 
enemy at bay while the white 56th 
Infantry, pocketed and hopelessly en- 
tangled in the enemy’s wire and under 
murderous enemy fire, was allowed to 
reorganize its position. It was for 
this deed that the Ist Battalion was 
cited for the Croix de Guerre. In 
this valley now are fields of produce, 
greener and more abundant than ever, 
enriched by the blood of those who 
gave their all. Gone are the machine 
gun pits and “pill-boxes,” only one 
stands now in “Death Valley,” a monu- 
ment to the heinous past. 

This attack, you “Buffaloes” will 
recall, had been ordered for Novem- 
ber 10th, the “zero hour,” at 5 A. M., 
and the attack was under way when 
orders came to cease hostilities. The 
plan for attack included a charge on 
the Bois Frehaut—a veritable lair of 
machine guns for it seemed that every 
one of its numerous trees held a sharp- 
shooter—by the 2nd Battalion of the 
366th Infantry. It included an attack 
by the 365th Infantry on the Bois 
Voirotte—a maze of barbed-wire en- 
tanglements. 


HENCE to Villers-sous-Preny, 

which had been held by the 367th 
Infantry for many days and from 
which the attack against Pagny had 
been launched. On the other side of 
the river were Bouxieres and Champey, 
unusually strongly fortified by four 
years of stabilized effort on the part 
of the Germans. It was their first 
line of defense. What a difference 
now! Everywhere busy French peas- 
ants, men and women, even children, 
cultivating their mosaic-like plots of 
ground. These villages have raised 
themselves out of the dust that German 
guns and the artillery manned by our 
black boys had razed. 

Along the road a little further we 
came to Vandieres, which had been 
occupied by the 366th Infantry when 
they had been ordered to the Bois 
Frehaut. It was in this engagement 
that Lieutenant Guy W. Cannady was 
killed outright and Lieutenant N. W. 
Rush, of Atlanta, fell mortally wound- 
ed, dying later after heroic and stren- 
uous efforts on the part of black surg-

eons to save him. There were mem- 
ories as we rode along of those un- 
cited and now forgotten ambulance 
drivers of the 366th Ambulance Com- 
pany, who for 72 continuous hours 
had driven over those shell-torn roads, 
often under the cover of darkness in 
an unlighted shrapnel and machine gun 
marked ambulance, evacuating the 
wounded. One driver collapsed in his 
seat as he brought back the load of 
mangled bodies which included Lieu- 
tenant Rush. 


HIAUCOURT, the first city en- 

tered in Alsace by American 
troops—and they were “Buffaloes”— 
was next visited. They still sell in the 
shops picture post cards showing our 
black boys in khaki entering the town. 
In the public square of this town is a 
most impressive monument to the dead 
of the French and Americans; but for 
that matter, there is no town in France 
too small to have a monument erected 
to the men who lost their lives in the 
Great War. 

At Thiaucourt is the American 
Cemetery for the St. Mihiel Sector. 
To those of you who have loved ones 
resting “over there” it will be consoling 
to know that these cemeteries are beau- 
tifully and reverentially maintained. 
As one walks around among the 
crosses all alike, 
graves, which are marked with the 
Cross of David, it is with bowed head 
and reverence. 


“There is on earth no worthier grave 
To hold the bodies of the brave 
Than this place of pain and pride 
Where they nobly fought and nobly 
died.” 


As we placed flowers upon the grave 
of Lieutenant Rush, we wondered if 
he and the thousands of others who 
died like him, had died in vain in the 
fight to make the world safe for De- 
mocracy. There is one consolation at 
least, even if our boys fought “jim- 
crowed,” there is no segregation here. 
They are buried “row on row” with- 
out regard to rank, organization or 
race. It may be interesting to know 
that Lieutenant Rush’s grave is almost 
directly behind the grave of Major 
Lufberry, the famous American Ace. 


EAVING Thiaucourt we went in 

the direction of Pont A’ Mous- 
son, through Fey-on-Haye. This little 
town for some reason has not been 
rebuilt, its crumbled walls remain as a 
spectre on the horizon. Pont A’Mous- 
son was taken on November the 9th 
by the 2nd Battalion of the 365th In- 
fantry. The bridge, which gives the 
name to the town, destroyed by the 
Germans in their retreat, has not been 
entirely rebuilt and we crossed over 


except the Jewish ° 


the same temporary structure that we 
crossed in the advance to Metz. Pon, 
A’Mousson has been entirely rebyjl; 
and its public square, with its yp. 
broken line of shops surrounding it, is 
again alive with business. There are 
many new houses, much more modern, 
yet retaining the typical French arch. 
itectural style. 

Here, we visited and lunched with 
Professor and Madame Camille Rol. 
land, who, many of the Buffaloes at. 
tached to the Sanitary Train will te. 
call, conducted the school at Millery. 
It was our good fortune to be billeted 
with this lovely, typically French fam. 
ily during the war. They have a new 
house now and grandpere is dead. 

From here back to Metz again, over 
a road no longer marked with camov- 
flage and shell craters, but flanked 
by two new lines of railroad track 
under construction. . 

These days “hiking” around Mew 
were filled with much interest to me 
and we are hoping that this narrative 
of our impressions will take you back 
to those crucial days. We wondered 
then as we wondered now whether 
the “Buffaloes”? could have taken the 
impregnable fortress known as Metz. 
But why wonder! La guerre est fini! 
The “Big Parade” is ended. 


How Shall We Vote?

and then try again. Sometimes in the 
past I have voted the Socialist ticket 
because it indicated successful effort. 
Sometimes I have voted otherwise in 
the hope of more practical and imme- 
diate gain, as in-the case of Wilson’ 
first administration. But this year 
when I read the platform of the 
Socialist Party and compare it with the 
Republican and Democratic platforms, 
there is absolutely no doubt in my mind 
but that this is the only platform be 
fore American people that has common 
sense or justice, reason or hope, written 
into it: It dares to mention Negro dis 
franchisement as a prime cause of reat- 
tion, fraud and privilege, and it ’ 
right. I shall vote for Thomas.

was hunted with the blunderbuss and 
brought down from his roost in the

The Dunbar National Bank 
(Continued from page 370) 
Negroes upon the Board, those instru- 

mental in establishing the bank say: 
“The Dunbar National Bank is, of 
course, an experiment and we must 
move slowly in deciding upon our 
policies, and until we see the response 
of the representative Negro business 
men of Harlem to this effort to be of 
assistance to them, we will have to 
delay the consideration of appointing 
any of them directors of the institution. 
It seems to us that we have gotten a 
Board which is very sympathetic with 
the aims of the Negro and they will 
deal with the questions which come up 
in the largest possible way for the 
benefit of the race. We may not make 
so much money in the end by this 


policy, but the Negro will be assured - 


that his own interests are constantly in 
our minds.” : 


T present no stock has been 
offered for sale to colored people 

and the reason is stated as follows: 
“The bank is only an experiment 
and until its success is definitely as- 
sured, we hesitate to invite subscrip- 
tons to its stock on the part of col- 
ored people. However, we have some 
plans under consideration for an allot- 
ment of stock to be subscribed for by 
tenant-owners in the Paul Laurence 
Dunbar Apartments ; it may be several 
months before this is definitely offered 
to them. The whole enterprise is en- 
tirely for the benefit of the colored 
people and if we can make it a great 
Success and then turn it over to them, 


November, 1928 


we will be all the more pleased.” 

The bank opened with a consider- 
able number of depositors, including 
organizations like the North Carolina 
Mutual Insurance Company, and a 
large number of visitors. Many per- 
sons regard the opening of the bank as 
a milestone in the advance of the Ne- 
gro, and agree with the telegram of 
R. R. Moton, Principal of Tuskegee 
Institute: 

“Please convey to President Higgins 
and other officers and directors my re- 
gret that the opening of the forty- 
eighth session of Tuskegee Institute 
prevents my being present at the open- 
ing of the new banking home of the 
Dunbar National Bank. The Dunbar 
Apartments with the bank marks a 
new epoch in the progress and -history 
of the Negro race. Of all the things 
that Mr. Rockefeller and his distin- 
guished father have done for the Ne- 
gro this new movement of his is with- 
out doubt among the most significant. 
He is giving the Negro a chance to 
work out his economic problem at six 
per cent a lesson that millions of our 
people as well as others need to learn.” 


N.A.A.C.P. Battle Front 
(Continued from page 369) 
numbers are working together appar- 
ently without friction or protest. In 
the Indian Office, in the Pension Of- 
fice, and the Geological Survey and 
other places, colored and white clerks 
work amicably together. So far as 
laborers and messengers are concerned, 
there is no discrimination at all, but 
this is perhaps because there are very 
few white people in these positions. All 
messengers are located at desks in halls 
and use the same locker rooms with- 

out discrimination. 


PECIFIC and open discrimina- 
tions have been found in the fol- 
lowing cases: , 
A. Segregation ‘of Negro clerks in 
separate rooms. In the Treasury De- 
partment, Room 308 of the Registrar’s 
Office, there are 30 colored clerks and a 
colored Section Chief working in a 
room by themselves. In the same of- 
fice, there are two other rooms, one 
with white girls, and the other with 
colored girls, making complete sepa- 
ration. In Room 341 of the Treasury 
Department, there are 5 colored clerks 
who are segregated. In the Navy De- 
partment, 11 colored clerks are put by 
themselves at one end of Room 3747- 
3750. In the Department of the In- 
terior, one colored girl stenographer, 
instead of being in the Stenographer’s 
Pool, is segregated in a room by her- 
self. The United States Veterans’ Bu- 
reau, Room 219, has 15 clerks and a 
Section Chief segregated. In the

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 


General Accounting Office, there are 
the following rooms with segregated 
colored clerks: Room 427, 4 clerks; 
Room 720, 8 clerks; Room 728, 5 
clerks; Rooms 721-31, 6 clerks. In 
the Division of Statistics, 18th Street 


and Pennsylvania Avenue, two colored ° 


clerks occupy Room 614 by themselves. 

B. In some cases, there is segrega- 
tion by grouping the colored clerks by 
themselves. This is true in the Gov- 
ernment Printing Office and the Bu- 
reau of Engraving and Printing. Also, 
in the Department of the Interior, in 
the Third Wing of the 5th Floor, 5 
colored clerks are segregated, and in the 
Third Wing of the 6th Floor, 2 clerks 
are segregated. 

C. Most of the segregation in Gov- 
ernment. departments relates to cafe- 
teria service. There are co-operative 
cafeterias in the Bureau of Engraving 
and Printing, and in the Government 
Printing Office. In each of these cases, 
there are separate tables for the colored 
clerks. In the Navy Department, the 
cafeteria operated by the Government, 
has separate tables for colored clerks. 
Concessionaires operate cafeterias in 
the Department of the Interior, the 
United States Post Office Building, 
and the City Post Office Building and 
the General Accounting Office. In 
all of these cases there are separate 
tables, and in one case, a separate room 
for colored clerks. 

D. There are separate lockers and 
toilets for white and colored clerks in 
the Bureau of Engraving and Print- 
ing, in the Washington City Post Of- 
fice, and in the Government Printing 
Office. 

E. In the General Land Office of 
the Department of Interior, there is 
discrimination in stenographic service. 
The colored clerks are served by a 
white man, while the white clerks call 
women stenographers from the Steno- 
graphic Pool. 


T will be noted that in none of the 

above cases are the discriminations 
a matter of life and death, and only 
in the evident policy of certain Bureau 
chiefs not to appoint colored clerks, 
even if they qualify, or to promote 
them on their record, is there a chance 
for energetic protest or legal action. 
The chief difficulty is in the principle 
laid down by the United States Gov- 
ernment. In a large number of cases 
the Government permits a discrimina- 
tion which has no basis except race 
and color. Most of the objects which 
the Government thus professes to seek 
would be accomplished easily by vol- 
untary action: colored and white clerks 
would quite naturally group them- 
selves according to their friendships 
and acquaintanceships at tables, and 
probably in their work. But to be

compelled to do this by administrative 
order or by custom or by fear of dis- 
missal, is an intolerable invasion of 
citizenship rights and calls for con- 
tinued protest on the part of Negro 
Americans. 


HE EFFORTS of the N. A. A. 
C. P. against this segregation pol- 
icy began back in 1913. August 15th an 
open letter to President Wilson was 
issued signed by Moorfield Storey, Dr. 
Du Bois and Oswald Garrison Vil- 
lard. It said among other things: 
“The National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People, 
through its Board of Directors, re- 
spectfully protests against the policy of 
your Administration in segregating the 
colored employees in the Departments 
at Washington. It realizes that this 
new and radical departure has been 
recommended, and is now being de- 
fended, on the ground that by giving 
certain bureaus or sections wholly to 
colored employees they are thereby 
rendered safer in possession of their of- 
fices and are less likely to be ousted or 
discriminated against. We believe this 
reasoning to be fallacious. It is based 
on a failure to appreciate the deeper 
significance of the new policy; to un- 
derstand how far reaching the effects of 
such a drawing of caste lines by the 
Federal Government may be, and how 
humiliating it is to the men thus stig- 
matized.” 


LLOWING this up in Novem- 

ber, the Secretary of the Board, 
Miss M. C. Nerney, made an investi- 
gation of the situation and reported 
segregation in many departments, but 
especially in the Bureau of Engraving 
and Printing, the Post Office Depart- 
ment, and the Treasury Department. 
A series of meetings were held under 
the auspices of the branches all over 
the country in connection with this. 
Wide publicity was given the matter. 
The Associated Press reported it and 
newspapers and magazines took up the 
matter. Later in the same month Mr. 
Monroe Trotter had an interview with 
President Wilson at which the Presi- 
dent got insulted at Trotter’s straight- 
forward demands. 

The result of this agitation seems to 
have been to stop any further spread of 
the segregation idea. The election of 
1916 and the war overshadowed the 
matter. But after the election of 
Harding in 1920, it was found that in- 
stead of segregation being abolished, 
that in many cases it was being in- 
creased by the Republicans. In 1923, 
the N. A. A. C. P. tried to get at the 
facts through the District of Columbia 
Branch, and the Secretary, S. J. 
Davidson, worked several months 
gathering considerable evidence. But 
he found reluctance on the part of the 
segregated colored clerks to make the

ACK of the founding of this company, which 
B has grown to be the greatest business enterprise 
of our Race, are the axe, the hoe, the broom and 
the spelling book—tools of success. 
With them, the founder of the National Benefit 
wrought his future from the smallest of beginnings 
as a hard-working boy on a Georgia farm. 
There are, on farms like that one and in workshop, 
foundry, mill and office, many thousands of soaring 
Negro youth—to whom this simple example of suc- 
cess may give hope and inspiration. 
It is to further such hopes and such aspirations that 
this organization exists. Its thirty years of con- 
tinuous growth prove that industry and faith, rooted 
in service, can overcome the world.

factseknown less they lose their jobs, 
In 1925, the N. A. A. C. P. sent 
secretly a white agent to Washington 
who interviewed numbers of people, 
white and colored, and confirmed the 
fact that segregation by race was stil] 
existent, but it was impossible to get 
the sort of proof required. 

The agitation again lapsed until it 
was brought up by a delegation under 
Mr. Monroe Trotter who went in 
1926 to President Coolidge, and later 
in 1927 by the Washington branch of 
the N. A. A. C. P. under the leader- 
ship of Neval H. Thomas, with the 
co-operation of other bodies. In the 
course of the campaign Mr. Thomas 
several times headed delegations which 
called upon department officials. In 
several of the delegations were Mr. A. 
S. Pinkett, Secretary of the Branch: 
Mr. Robert J. Nelson, of the Elks and 
the Washington Eagle; Mr. Thomas 
A. Johnson of the Equal Rights 
League. 

The National Office began a na- 
tion-wide press campaign and the re- 
sult was that segregation was practi- 
cally ended in the Pension Bureau and 
Department of the Interior and in the 
Census Bureau and Department of 
Commerce. 


The Browsing Reader 
(Continued from page 374) 


The larger part of the book, from 
page 140 to 300, is a history and apol- 
ogy for the American intervention. 
With the thesis of this part, most 
Negroes, whether Haitian or Ameri- 
can, will not entirely agree, and they 
will certainly dispute the sub-structure 
of fact which leads the author to con- 
clude that “it is difficult to see how 
armed intervention could well have 
been avoided.” 

With all this, Mr. Davis is by no 
means a thick and thin defender of 
United States policies. He points out 
many mistakes in action and organiza- 
tion, just as he criticizes the Haitian 
elite. Most readers will agree with 
his general conclusions. He suggests 
three possible policies: (1) Complete 
withdrawal of the United States from 
Haiti; (2) Indefinite intervention; or, 
(3) Definite announcement of with- 
drawal in 1936 and a program designed 
“to prepare the Haitian people to take 
over and administer an efficient inde- 
pendent government.” Of these the 
first would be an abject confession of 
incompetency; the second, impossible 
of ratification by agreement, either in 
Haiti or in the United States; while 
the third is, Mr. Davis thinks, the only 
decent way out. 

He doubts, moreover, if present poli- 
cies are preparing for this conclusion, 
and says:

“Many Haitians of the upper class 
have been educated in France, and 
their traditions, culture, and language 
are French, not African. They re- 
spond at once to courteous treatment 
and are equally quick to resent con- 
descension and any evidence of the feel- 
ing of radical superiority which many 
Americans find it so difficult to con- 
ceal. The mistake of employing in 
Haiti Americans who have strong rac- 
jal prejudices against the Negro has 
been stressed by almost every observer 
who has visited Haiti since the inter- 
vention. Haitians of the upper class 
are fully aware that such racial pre- 
judices are much stronger in the United 
States than in any European country, 
and this very fact entails a definite 
obligation on the part of Americans 
in Haiti. No American who does not 
care to maintain a certain amount of 
ordinary social intercourse with Ne- 
groes should be sent to a Negro state.” 

W. E. B. D. 


IN THE MAGAZINES 


ARPER’S for August carries 

the omnipresent conjure story, 
“Satan am a Snake” by Wilbur Daniel 
Steele. Dukey, a gray-brown colored 
girl, has fang teeth and a hellish grin 
which she uses to “conjure” her com- 
panions. Under the influence of a mes- 
meric swamp moon, Dukey sleeps—and 
her fang teeth, which are her most 
precious possession, are extracted. That 
night Dukey is “married”. 

The leading editorial in The Com- 
monweal for September 5th is on “The 
New Emancipation” of black America. 
The writer says that the emergence of 
the Negro race from the dark past is 
one of the major American movements ; 
and that the Negro has played and will 
continue to play an important role in 
the economic and political situation of 
this country. ‘To race leaders must 
fall the task of solving the Negro prob- 
lem; but the process can be speeded up 
by intelligent white aid. 

A brief article in the Literary Digest 
for September 8th tells “Why the 
Haussa Negro Language *is Deemed 
Loveliest of all”. It seems that Haus- 
sa Negroes, dwelling in the Soudan, 
are primarily a commercial people, and 
for generations they have travelled 
with their caravans even as far as 
India. Thus many words have been 
incorporated in the language by cross 
currents of traffic and by colonization 
of other peoples. 

L. Marquard in The Nineteenth 
Century for July writes on “The Na- 
tive Question in South Africa”, Mr. 
Marquard says that the history of the 
native problem -in South Africa has 

fen one of failure: failure to recog- 
nize the impossibility of maintaining as 
subject a race that outnumbers the

DR. DuBOIS’ 


powerful new novel 


DARK PRINCESS 


HIS is Dr. DuBois’ first work of fiction since his well-remem- 
bered ““Darkwater”. In it he reveals new and vigorous pow- 
ers. The hero of the novel, a young American Negro fleeing 
from racial discrimination—and the heroine—a Princess of India— 
become involved in a movement for the emancipation of the dark 
races. This powerful and dramatic story moves from Berlin to 
Chicago and Atlanta. $2.00

ruling race four to one; failure to ree. 
ognize that the native question and 
industrial problems are the same thing 
and that the native is the proletariat; 
failure to recognize that the interests 
of the two races should be one; and 
the failure to recognize the potential 
economic value of the native as a citi. 
zen of the union. 

Africa for April carries an article 
by I. Schapera on ‘Economic Changes 
in South African Native Life”, My. 
Schapera says that there is no uniform. 
ity about the native question—tha 
while there are some tribes which cling 
to their old tribal customs, there are 
yet others which approximate a Euro- 
pean existence in mode of life, economic 
occupations, and outlook on life, Ip 
the early years of the European in. 
vasion, contact between the two peo- 
ples consisted entirely in trade, but jt 
is becoming necessary for them to come 
together to work out methods of pro- 
cedure for social, economic and _politi- 
cal contact. 

When Harry L. Foster visited the 
editors of the twelve or more Haitian 
dailies, he found they had two general 
complaints to make on the “American 
Haters of Haiti”. First, that Ameri- 
can intervention was a blow to Haitian 
pride; and second, that Americans, and 
the few Haitians that the Marines 
keep in power, hold all the best jobs. 
Haitians see in the influx of American 
capital the possibility of continuous oc- 
cupation. This article may be found 
in Independent for August 1 Ith. 

“The Fruits of Haitian Occupa- 
tion”, says Mr. Foster, in the same 
magazine for August 18th, are the 
road building program, and the fight 
for sanitation in Haiti. Perhaps it is 
a tribute to the “efficiency” of Ameri- 
cans that two physicians can treat 950 
patients a day! 

New Masses for July carries “My 
Brother”, by Socrates Sandino. This 
is a stark history of the life of Augusto 
Sandino, the rebel-patriot of Nicaragua. 
Sandino is the torch-bearer of Nica 
ragua—a hard-working man who has 
faith in Nicaragua’s peasantry. 

There is a hint of jessamine in the 
air, and the faint perfume of pressed 
roses; silver-haired grandames in lav- 
endar and old lace rock gently to and 
fro on vine-covered piazzas, and Negro, 
slaves hover in the background. This 
is the picture Benjamin Brawley paints 
of the old decadent South in writing 
of “The Southern Tradition” in The 
North American Review for Septen- 
ber. Mr. Brawley says that the spint 
of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, ’ 
slowly permeating the new Southland, 
and that the younger generation is de- 
veloping a scientific approach to social 
problems.

has decided to admit the 700 natives 
engaged in the industry. This is the 
first time that a European trade union 
in South Africa has admitted native 
workers. .. E 

q At Bloemfontein, in Orange Free 
Siate, an attempt is being made by the 
Town Council, to establish a minimum 
wage of about 3 shillings for native 
unskilled labor. The present wage 
averages 2s. 3d. 

( In the Transvaal, the Johannes- 
burg joint council of Europeans and 
natives is an inter-racial group of 60 
persons. It was organized 5 years ago 
by Dr. F. G. Bridgman of the Ameri- 
can Zulu Mission. It contains a large 
number of leading whites and natives 
and has taken up the matter of hous- 
ing, recreation, and General Hertzog’s 
proposed native legislation. It has 
issued three pamphlets with regard to 
these bills and is about to publish a 
fourth. 

@ A second conference of Europeans 
and natives was called by the Dutch 
Reform Church at Capetown in Jan- 
uary, 1927. As a result of their re- 
quest, the Hertzog native bills were 
referred to a select committee before 
the second reading. 

@ In Cape Province there are 15,000 


native voters out of a total voting 


population of 150,000. In Natal there- 


are only about 12 native voters and 
there are none in the Transvaal and 
the Free State. 


WEST AFRICA 


@ Alarm is being felt on the Gold 
Coast on account of the extraordinary 
amount of liquor which is being im- 
ported. This amounted to 1,300,000 
gallons last year for a population of 
2,300,000. So far England has re- 
fused to limit the importation. 

@ In London, an African girl, Miss 
Christiana $. Thompson, of the Gold 
Coast, was married to Dr. Edward 
Tagoe of the Gold Coast Government 
Service. The bride was a student at 
Portway College, Reading. Among 
the guests was Sir Gordon Guggis- 
berg, former Governor of the Gold 
Coast.

@ The total trade imports and ex- 
ports of Nigeria for 1927 exclusive of 
specie amounted to £32,005,594. Cot- 
ton goods were chiefly imported, 
followed by dried fish, tobacco and 
motor cars. The exports were chiefly 
palm kernels and oil, cocoa and 
tin. The total trade of Sierra Leone 
for 1927, imports and exports, were 
£ 3,879,283.

word about that. We must somehow 
manage to hive together, and there is 
only one way in which we can live to- 
gether—with goodwill. And there is 
only one thing that ever yet created good- 
will and that is goodwill. Somebody 
must start it. Somebody must gener- 
ously pour goodwill into this situation. 

It is a teasing and tortuous road that 
civilization has got us on. We are 
learning to live with all these nations, 
colors, creeds, and castes that for cen- 
turies have been specializing in their 
differences. It is very difficult—so diffi- 
cult that Peter himself did not fully live 
up to his housetop vision. Only, my 
friends, illwill has no contribution to 
make. Prejudice is poison, And if there

generous goodwill into this situation, 
surely it is the disciples of him who long 
centuries ago walked out into the an- 
cient world, where the problem was 
harder than it is with us, and set his 
disciples saying, Neither Jew nor Greek, 
Scythian, barbarian, bond nor free, but 
one man in Christ. 

There is a fine story that comes from 
the Zulu wars in Africa. A British offi- 
cer was sent out with a contingent of 
his men against the Zulus. The Zulus 
sent out a peace messenger and the 
British by mistake shot him. That 
touched the honor of the British officer. 
He turned his command over to his 
lieutenant. He disarmed himself and 
all alone he walked out from the British 
ranks toward his enemies. In surprise 
the Zulus took him in and brought him 
to their chief. “I have come,” said the 
British officer, “to give myself up be- 
cause we shot your peace messenger by 
mistake. It is a thing brave warriors 
never do. I am very sorry. To make 
amends I place my life in your hands. 
Do with me as you will.” And after a 
moment’s silence the Zulu chief said, 
“You are a man, and your people are 
men, and the sons of men; we too are 
men. We will make peace.”
