GREETINGS 


from. the 
Home Office 


Southern Aid Society 
—— of Virginia, Inc. 


Age, with Corporations, acts very much as it does with individuals; as 


people grow older, they value more highly friendships and cooperation. 


The Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc., therefore, on its 35th greeting to 
policyholders and friends, has a warmth for them that cannot be expressed in 
words. During the last year, as in previous years over its history, the policy- 
holders and friends have loyally supported and appreciated its efforts to provide 
them with the best in insurance protection, and in service in the payment of 
claims, in cooperating with all other race endeavors, and in opening doors of 
employment and opportunities to our people. The Society has done, during 
1927, the largest business of any year of its career and likewise has rendered to 
policyholders and the public, the largest service in the sums paid out for sick- 
ness, accident and death, in enterprises. Such a wonderful record during the 
past year, and previous years, could not have been accomplished without the 
untiring efforts of the most loyal and race interested groups of Senior and 


Junior Officers, Superintendents, Agents and Clerks. 


Thus the Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc., closes the year with a heart 
filled with gratitude to its policyholders and friends, and plans in the New Year 


to render even a more acceptable service to both policyholders and the race.

“No One Has Gone Hungry, Un-

MISSISSIPPI 
The Situation 


ACH large plantation is farmed 

by a number of tenants, or share- 
croppers, who are furnished with 
houses and living through the year by 
the planter. That is, they are given 
credit at the plantation store and 
“Christmas money” for the holidays. 
In the fall when the crop is in, the 
amount of the tenant’s indebtedness 
is, theoretically, subtracted from the 
amount coming to him as his share of 


the crop and the balance is paid to 
him. The planter, of course, keeps 
the amount of indebtedness higher than 
the value of the crop, and by this 
method can hold the tenant to work 
for another year under the same con- 
tract. Practically all such tenants are 
Negroes and in some cases there are 
several hundred families held in this 
kind of peonage on one plantation. 
The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta is a 
one-crop country. The planter is a 
gambler, who stakes all he has each

year on cotton. One successful year 
will make him rich. For five or six 
years he has been losing steadily. The 
price of cotton went down until last 
year it reached a point so low that a

who happened to store their crop in a 
high place sold this year at a high

profit. With the exception of these 
the entire Delta, bankrupt before the 
flood, was left in a hopeless condition 
by the disaster. Practically all of the 
plantations were already mortgaged 
for more than their actual value. The 
mortgages are, for the most part, held 
by insurance companies. Plantations 
are financed each year by a “furnish 
loan” from a local bank. This is ac- 
tually a mortgage on a potential crop. 
The amount of the loan is based on 
the amount of land and labor. The 


planter must show that he has a ten- 
ant family to every twenty acres. The 
loan is used for all the year’s ex- 
penses—seed, feed for the stock and 
food, clothing, etc., for the tenants. 
The planter is thus dependent on his 
tenants and obliged for his existence 
to hold them on his land by fair means 
or foul. 

There is an understanding to the 
effect that a disaster which destroys 
the year’s crop automatically cancels 
the contract. ‘Therefore after a se- 
rious overflow, if a share-cropper 
wishes to leave a plantation he feels 
free to do so. At such times the 
planter often resorts to any pressure 





possible to keep his tenants from leav- 
ing him. The unwritten law in Mis- 
sissippi is that no plantation owner 
will try to entice labor away from an- 
other plantation. Anyone who is sus- 
pected of this crime is despised and 
outcast. Therefore the labor agent, 
whose business it is to do this, is con- 
sidered the most contemptible of men. 
He must carry on his work in secrecy, 
for if it were definitely known, he 
would certainly be treated with vio- 
lence, if not lynched.

The Planter and the Red Cross 


N the early days of the flood of 

1927, when it became apparent that 
their land would be inundated, the 
planters were greatly alarmed. They 
opposed the plan of the Red Cross to 
remove their Negro labor to refugee 
camps because, as they stated plainly, 
if the Negroes once got away they 
would never get them back. It was 
at that time not generally believed that 
the flood would be of any great dura- 
tion and most of the planters felt that 
the Negroes could be cared for safely 
in buildings on the plantations. They 
opposed the Red Cross policy with 
enough vigor to handicap the rescue 
work seriously. In order to get their 
cooperation the Red. Cross made an 
agreement with them, pledging them- 
selves to return the tenants to the 
plantations from which they came. By 
this agreement the Red Cross assumed 
the responsibility not only of caring 
for the tenants during the period of 
emergency relief, but of protecting 
plantation owners against labor agents 
and of persuading and coercing those 
tenants who did not wish to return to 
their plantations. Miss Wagner who 
was in charge of work in the refugee 
camp at Natchez told me of this agree- 
ment and I had the same statement 
from Miss Pauline Marshall who was 
in charge at Vicksburg. The ar- 
rangement could hardly have been car- 
ried out, however, without the hearty 
cooperation of the National Guard. 
The Guardsmen, under the direction 
of the Red Cross, were in charge of 
the refugee camps in most places, with 
police and sentry duty. No one was 
allowed to enter or leave camp with- 
out a pass, except at the discretion of 
the Captain in charge. By these 
means (as previously reported) the 
refugees were prevented from leaving 
without the approval of the Red Cross 
and labor agents were kept from mak- 
ing contacts with them. 


The Evacuation of the Camps 


N spite of this agreement many of 

the planters continued to be uneasy 
in regard to their labor and as soon 
as the water showed signs of receding 
they began to send for their tenants. 
Early in May, while boat-loads of 
refugees were still coming in to Vicks- 
burg from the Yazoo and Sunflower 
Rivers, plantation managers from 
Washington County were coming after 
their Negro tenants. The plantation 
owner sent to the Red Cross a state- 
ment that his land was dry, or partly 
dry and that he wished his tenants 
returned, and enclosed a list of their 
names. The Red Cross worker !o- 
cated them in camp or in town and 
ordered them to be ready to leave on 
the day set. The refugees protested 


42 





both because they did not wish to re- 
turn to the plantations and because 
they knew their homes were still under 
water. They were forced to do so 
by the combined bullying of the Red 
Cross workers, the National Guard 
and the plantation manager. At- 
tempts to remonstrate or argue were 
usually met by: “Shut up and get on 
that truck”—sometimes with a threat 
from a Guardsman of what would 
happen if they refused. They never 
did refuse. Instead they returned to 
the plantations where they stayed in 
barns or other buildings from which 
the water had receded or in Red Cross 
tents pitched on the wet, soggy “dry 
land”. On the Dawson Plantation 
at Cary fifty Negro families lived in 
a colored church for weeks. In the 
midst of this premature evacuation of 
camp came the unexpected second rise 
early in June and even these places 
of refuge were again flooded. Some 
of the refugees were sent back to camp, 
or found their way there alone; but 
the majority stayed in the vicinity, on 
the levee or some high place, enduring 
acute misery rather than return to the 
brutal treatment of the National 
Guard. Rations were furnished to 
them by the Red Cross, usually being 
issued to the planter or his manager 
and distributed by him to the tenants. 


The June rise postponed the evacua- 
tion of camps a very little. Red Cross 
orders were to send the refugees back 
as rapidly as possible. At Vicksburg 
both colored camps were closed be- 
fore the end of June although the 
white camp was kept until the twenty- 
second of August. The reason for this 
haste is not quite clear as it was far 
easier and simpler to care for the peo- 
ple in a concentrated camp than scat- 
tered about the country. Economy is 
a possible motive, but it seems safe to 
assume that the actual reason was the 
demand of the planters. 


ATIONING on plantations was 

done on the basis of a list of 
needy families furnished by the planta- 
tion owner or manager, but the actual 
distribution was generally delegated to 
the store keeper. As the plantation 
stores had been flooded with a conse- 
quent heavy loss the store-keeper (who 
may have been the owner or manager 
also) took this opportunity to renew 
the stock, putting the fresh Red Cross 
supplies in their store-rooms and ra- 
tioning the people with the wormy 
flood-damaged goods from their shelves. 
This was a very common practice and 
one of which there is no question. It 
was almost universal in Issaqueena 
County and in Washington County 
except around Greenville and also oc- 
curred very often in Sharkey and War- 
ren Counties, though less openly. The 
Red Cross was entirely aware of the 


practice and in some cases tried to 
put a stop to it. The only way this 
would have been possible would have 
been to have all rationing done 
through Red Cross workers from Red 
Cross store-rooms, to _ individuals. 
This would have been certain to cause 
bad feeling between the Red Cross 
and the planters and was therefore not 
to be contemplated. Instead they al- 
lowed the Negroes to return to live in 
houses which had been under water in 
many cases as long as three months, 
and to be rationed on spoiled food un- 
til a serious outbreak of pellagra re- 
sulted. A doctor who had charge of 
Red Cross cases on three plantations 
(Dr. Westmoreland of Murphy, 
Miss.) said there was a case of pella- 
gra in practically every tenant house 
and frequently every member of a fam- 
ily was ill. In his opinion it was en- 
tirely due to the Red Cross rationing 
and could easily have been prevented 
by a better chosen ration list and avoid- 
ing the distribution of spoiled food. 
Somewhat tardily the Red Cross “ral- 
lied to meet a new need” and imported 
several car-loads of powdered yeast for 
the treatment of the disease, and in 
addition distributed sweet potato 
plants. In some cases these were given 
directly to the Negroes, but very often 
they were given to the planter, the 
understanding being that he would 
plant them all and divide the crop 
among the tenants. 


The Rehabilitation of Tenants 


HE original plan and intention of 

_ the Red Cross was to have each 
tenant or flood victim visited by the 
worker in charge. The houses were 
to be seen, the statement of losses and 
needs confirmed, and household goods 
awarded on this basis. The losses of 
Negro tenants consisted chiefly of fur- 
niture and clothing, the latter being 
replaced during the emergency period 
from the quantities of second-hand 
clothing contributed. Occasionally 
mules or other stock were reported in 
the lists of losses but I have not heard 
that they were ever replaced except 
to white people, although they may 
have been in exceptional cases. 

To replace household goods the Red 
Cross has purchased goods in quantity 
and distributed them as needed. The 
cost has been kept to an incredibly 
small amount. T. R. Buchanan, Red 
Cross Area Director in Washington 
County, told me that a family of five 
with a total loss was rehabilitated for 
$20.00. A bed cost approximately 
$2.00, chairs fifty cents, etc. The 
grade of goods may be judged fairly 
by the prices. 

The fairness of the distribution de- 
pended upon the Red Cross worker in

charge. In some places the worker 
had actually carried out the instruc- 
tions in the simplest way, visited the 
houses, noted the losses, and sent out 
supplies according to the need. These 
places were very rare. The usual 
method was for the worker to talk to 
the planter, interview a few tenants 
at the plantation store, and send a 
more or less haphazard selection of 
furniture to the store-keeper to be dis- 
tributed by him. This again gave the 
store keeper an opportunity to replen- 
ish his stock. As they did with food, 
they also put Red Cross furniture in 
their store-rooms and disbursed in- 
stead their own damaged goods. Later 
they can charge the tenants a high 
price for these things. I was told by 
many people, among them Miss Gail 
Bradley, one of the best Red Cross 
workers, that it was well known that 
many plantation* stores have on hand 
enough Red Cross supplies to carry 
them through the winter. 

The rehabilitation of the section 
around Hollandale had been finished 
and the worker, Miss Marion Wald 
had left when I visited this section. 
This area included Murphy and the 
Houston Plantation. I found that 
Miss Wald had not been inside of 
any of the houses but had decided the 
probable needs of the families by her 
imagination. I visited cabin after 
cabin in this neighborhood, and found 
in all of them the same picture of utter 
dreariness and desolation, accepted 
with incredible patience and uncom- 
plaining fortitude. In the white ten- 
ant houses I found an adequate amount 
of furniture given by the Red Cross, 
and a vastly more hopeful outlook in 
every respect, but a general attitude of 
bitter resentment because they had not 
received more. 


HE first house 1 visited was one 

to which I was taken by Dr. 
Westmoreland to see a special case of 
pellagra. It was a two-roomed shanty 
which had been under water for more 
than two months. Water was still 
standing in the yard when the family 
moved back. The mud and filth had 
been scrubbed away but had left its 
mark which no scrubbing could re- 
move. T'wo rusty iron beds stood in 
one room. On one of them, on a new 
Red Cross mattress, wrapped in musty, 
smelly bedding, was a week-old baby. 
The mattress for the other bed was 
on the floor, because the bed-springs 
had rusted completely away and no 
others had been provided. The rest 
of the furniture had either been de- 
stroyed or swept away by the swift 
current. Beside the mattresses the 
had given them four 
straight chairs, so cheaply made that 
they were already coming apart and 
a tiny stove, scarcely two feet high 


February, 1928 


After the Red Cross 


even when set up on two layers of 
bricks. They had no dishes, cooking 
utensils, table, or bedding. There 
were four children beside the baby, 
one of them seriously ill with pellagra, 
and three adults. They had received 
no rations for six weeks and the man 
had neither work nor credit. This I 
soon found was not an exceptional, 
but a very typical case. Near by on 
Houston Brothers’ Plantation I saw a 
man named Enoch Williams who had 
a family of five and had lost every- 
thing he owned. His Red Cross award 
had consisted of four chairs. His 
“‘boss-man” gave him cotton to fill two 
bed ticks. They were cooking over 
a camp-fire in utensils they had found 
in the wreckage beside the river. An- 
other man on the same. plantation, 
named John Williams, with a family 
of five, also had a total loss. His son 
is in the last stages of tuberculosis. 
They received from the Red Cross 
one blanket, one mattress, one chair. 
They searched among the wreckage 
that is strewn along the banks of the 
river and found a few broken pieces 
of furniture which they have propped 
up with bricks and now using. 

In this same neighborhood, I was 
told by a reputable white man, that 
the emergency rations first issued in- 
cluded, beside the regular ration list, 
such things as canned sweet potatoes, 
peaches, sardines and sausages. These 
were issued to the store managers for 
distribution to the tenants, but were 
divided among the white people in the 
locality. There were no cases of pel- 
lagra among the whites. 


N Sharkey County the first worker, 

Miss Moxley, caused so much dis- 
satisfaction by her unfairness that a 
petition was circulated in Rolling 
Fork, and the Red Cross was asked 


to remove her. This was done and a 





Withdrew Its Tents 


man from Ohio was put in her place. 
Under his management there has been 
a decided improvement both in white 
and colored cases. A much better 
grade of furniture was purchased and 
the work was done on an actual in- 
dividual basis, by the worker in charge. 
The same abuses continued on the 
plantations, but to a lesser degree and 
there was a serious effort to end them. 

In Issaqueena County the situation 
is about the same as in Washington. 
Warren County is somewhat better. 
‘The man in charge for a time at Vicks- 
burg was reprimanded I was told by 
Mr. John Cremer at National Head- 
quarters because, as it was put, “he 
got so interested in the social situation 
that he forgot what he was there for”. 
It may be due to his interest that the 
plantations at Redwood, Yokena, Ce- 
dars and Glass showed much better 
conditions. 


Migration from the Delta 


N spite of the united. efforts of the 

Red Cross and plantation owners 
to hold the Negroes on the land by 
force a general movement from the 
Delta began soon after the evacua- 
tion of the refugee camps. All tenant 
houses were damaged and many swept 
entirely away by the flood. At first a 
few families, rather than endure the 
misery of living in make-shift tem- 
porary quarters until the rehabilita- 
tion program could be carried out, 
went at once to the hills or upper 
Delta, where there was plenty of work 
to be had. Others waited to see what 
the Red Cross was going to do, but it 
soon became clear that it would do so 
little as to be negligible. Ten or 
twelve dollars’ worth of cheap house- 
hold goods was not worth enduring 
unnecessary hardships for. More and 
more families packed up their few 
belongings and left. (Turn to page 64)

with the ball. If a fumble or other 
misplay occurs, Millér and Redd are 
there after the ball every time. Both 
are sure tacklers and hard line hitters. 

For center I have chosen Tadlock 
(Tuskegee), a man whose passing back 
and all-round playing make him a most 
valuable player. His passes never go 
astray, and his line splitting charges 
bother his opponents in every scrim- 
mage. He catches well and tackles 
like a demon. 

Jones (Oklahoma), McConnell 
(West Virginia), Stevenson (Tuske- 
gee) and Cain (Bluefield) form a 
wonderful backfield. Cain was the 
best field general of 1927. He knows 
how to direct a team. Cool and brainy, 


Miller 


THE Crisis 











he meets every situation determinedly, 
outguessing, outgeneraling and out- 
fighting his opponents. His sound 
judgment when on the offensive and 
his ability to learn quickly the enemy’s 
plays and players, enable him to upset 
his enemy’s plans and lead his team to 
victory. He passes splendidly, and he 
is a good kicker, a fast runner, a kill- 
ing tackler and a reliable catcher of 
passes. 

Jones played both quarter and half 
on Oklahoma’s team. He is one of the 
fastest and quickest backs in the game. 
His fleetness and dodging and ducking 
antics make him a difficult man to stop, 
and his catching, kicking and passing 
are always dangerous. At snatching 
passes he is as good as his teammate 
Williams and the superior of all backs 
in the game. 

McConnell is a player who can be 
depended upon to make gains. When 
he carries the ball, his team advances, 
and when he goes after an opponent, 
the enemy’s advance is halted. He is a 
fine ball toter, a good pass snatcher, 
and a heady open. field runner. He 
makes his way through the smallest 
holes, and he seldom fails to gain a 
touchdown when his team is near the 
enemy’s goal line. 


At full Stevenson, the most ver- 
satile Negro back, is placed. He can 
run, catch, tackle, pass, block and 
kick. His smashing drives and open 
field running brought victory to Tus- 
kegee in many games. Thoughtful, 
watchful and dependable, he is al- 
ways a threat, for he seldom fails to 
register gains when called on. Alert 
and fast, he hits the enemy’s defense 
like a whirlwind, making holes through 
which he passes with lightning ra- 
pidity. 

The men placed on the Second and 
Third teams know foot ball and give 
their best in every contest in which 
they participate. Breaux was a gen- 
eral whose plans seldom failed, and 
McPherson, Bailey and Williams 
starred in every game they played. The 
other players proved their worth on 
many a hard-fought field. 

Outstanding Teams 

HE foot ball season of 1927 pro- 

duced three outstanding teams,— 
Tuskegee, Oklahoma and Bluefield, 
representing the southeast, the far 
southwest and the mid-west. These 
teams were not defeated during the 
season. Team work and fighting 
spirit gave them “clean slates”. Thou- 
sands saw them play each Saturday, 
and their supporters came from all sec- 
tions of the country. 

Tuskegee had a hard schedule. It 
won over Straight (47-0), Clark (28- 
12), Fisk (32-0), Lincoln (29-0), 
Morehouse (14-0), Talladega (28-0), 
Florida (33-12), Knoxville (21-6), 


February, 1928 


and Atlanta (7-0), and tied Alabama 
State (0-0). Tuskegee’s squad had 
more than fifty members, with Steven- 
son, Bailey, Wooten, Paul Smith, 
Shanklin, and Stewart, backs; and 
Tadlock, McKinney, Harris, Walker, 
Joseph, the Robinsons, Britton and 
Champion, linemen, the brightest stars. 


‘Tuskegee has not lost a game since 
1923 and has been tied but three times 
in five years. It has played forty-eight 
games during these five years and 
scored 1246 points against its oppon- 
ents 184 points. 


There is a disquieting report that 
‘Tuskegee and Lincoln will not meet 
in 1928. Lincoln is asking Tuskegee 
to put into effect a rule which will 
limit the playing of varsity men to 
three years. Many Negro colleges 
maintain both a preparatory school and 
a college department, and any athlete 
who proves good enough may play on 
the team that represents the main foot 
ball power and strength of these col- 
leges before he enters the college de- 
partment as a student and continue as 
a member of the varsity team through- 
out his college career. Fans are hop- 
ing that athletic relations between 
these schools will continue. 


Oklahoma’s schedule contained but 
six games, but it could not be denied 
victory in any contest. It defeated 
Wiley 27 to 0; Prairie View 12 to 6, 
Lincoln (Mo.) 51 to 0; Alabama 
State, 14 to 0, and when there were 
no more colleges in the far southwest 
to conquer, it met and defeated Okmul- 
gee Y (54-0) and Santa Fé Athletic 
Club (44-0). The Oklahoma ma- 
chine was one of the smoothest work- 
ing organizations in foot ball. Its pass- 
ing attack bewildered every team 
against which it played, and its buck- 
ing, running and plunging tactics gave 
all foes much to worry about. Wil- 
liams (end), Jones (back), Johnson 
(back), Doster (center) and Wert 
(guard) know foot ball and how to 
play it, and their work was felt in 


every game. The Oklahomans have 
lost but one game in three years. 


The playing of Bluefield was one of 
the big features of the season. Almost 
unknown before September 24, 1927, 
when it defeated Knoxville (38-0), 
Bluefield attracted national attention 
when it downed Howard 18 to 7, and 
after its tie with Wilberforce and its 
victory over West Virginia (18-7), it 
was called “the wonder team’. All 
eyes were turned toward its game each 
week-end. Every man on the team 
was a fighter, and the team often ac- 
complished that which seemed impos- 
sible, snatching victory from defeat 
more than once. In the game with 
Virginia Seminary and College, with 
the score 13 to 7 and only four minutes 
to play before the last gun, Bluefield 
came from behind to win 14 to 13. 
Cain (quarter), Gallion (tackle), 
Wiggins (half), Graves (full), and 
Jeffries (end) won fame leading Blue- 
field to victory. 


Howard and Lincoln, “the big 
teams” of the East, played ragged foot 
ball in 1927. Both were beaten sev- 
eral times, Howard losing to Bluefield, 
West Virginia (6-0) and Atlanta 
(6-0), and Lincoln being on the littie 
end of the score in games with West 
Virginia, North Carolina A. & T., 
Virginia Union, Hampton, Tuskegee, 
Virginia Seminary and College, and 
Howard. Howard’s team was prac- 
tically the team of 1926, but in the 
early weeks of the season morale was 
at low tide, and the team could not 
muster that fighting spirit which wins 
foot ball games. Howard’s 19 to 0 
victory over Lincoln on Thanksgiving 
Day was its seventh win out of twenty- 
three games played against Lincoln. 
Six games ended in draws and ten 
were Lincoln victories. 


Wilberforce and West Virginia rank 
next to Bluefield in the midwest. Wil- 
berforce lost but one game, a forfeited 
fray (1-0) to Howard, and it tied 
West Virginia (Turn to page 64)

Calendar Chat 
“And I forgot thee, as the berried 


holly 

By shepherds is forgotten, when in 
June, 

Tall chestnuts keep away the sun and 
moon.” 


ERHAPS I should talk about val- 

entine flowers and butterflies. Yet 
winter is still here, and I am going to 
make holly my subject, if you'll for- 
give me. 


There are two straight prim holly: 


trees growing in a square near where 
I live. I call them the Holly Tree 
Twins. They look so much alike and 
are growing quite apart from other 
trees in the square and act unlike the 
poplars and elms and maples. 

Very early in the spring the poplar 
buds unroll and wave glossy brown- 
edged leaves. Elm foliage appears, 
oval and lettuce green. And what are 
my Holly Twins doing? Standing 
still. 

Before I knew them well I felt sad 
to see them so backward for they had 
proved staunch winter friends that 
cheered me with green when other 
trees appeared lifeless. But with the 
coming of spring the stiff foliage 
looked stale and out of place. I rather 
regretted that my hollies had not shed 
in autumn with their companions. 
How the spring suns seemed to mock 
the twins with their dark bark and 
somber foliage! 


But one day I was to be greeted by 
tender new brownish leaves at the foot 
of the Holly Twins and on looking 
higher, to see fresh touches of green 
everywhere, mild touches, but unmis- 
takable. The new foliage made slow 
entry day by day. But it persisted and 
turned yellower as it grew. It had 
come on so gradually. The stiff leaves 
did not wave in spring winds as maple 
leaves. Yet I felt an indescribable 
pride in seeing those twins take on 
foliage that would outlive all other 
greens of the park. 


“Like a star, without haste, without 
rest”—this had been the process.

““Advance”’ 


T was a custom in our village school 

to celebrate on St. Valentine’s Day 
in the afternoon. We would put aside 
our books and joyously begin the val- 
entine exchange. A pasteboard box 
with a slot in the lid awaited our of- 
ferings on the teacher’s desk. And 
when we had tripped up one by one 
and dropped our valentines in the box 
it remained only for us to listen for 
the sound of our names. 

These would be called by the teacher 
as she handled the little packets and 
sorted them over. I received a queer 
valentine one afternoon when my time 
came. And though there were others 
for me at the same dealing, the trim 
red hearts and clusters of forget-me- 
nots and Watteau men and women and 


Cupids have all but passed in scarlet 
and blue confusion from my memory, 
I simply recall the strange valentine. 
It was home made. 


BOY ’S sister had created it her- 
self and the boy was so proud of 
this fact that he forgot that there was 
supposed to be mystery connected with 
the dispatching of valentines and adver- 
tised his sister’s skill broadcast. I can 
see the bright crimson dove now—it 
was drawn with careful flourishing— 
and beside it in writing heavy with 
“shading” the word “Advance”. Scar- 
let zephyr or wool thread held the two 
sheets of the valentine together. Why 
did the loop tailed dove bear to me 
the word ‘Advance’? I wondered. 
One day in a ponderous old “Home 
Encyclopedia of General Information” 
that promised to instruct one in pen- 
manship, silver plating, music, dress- 
making, bookkeeping and other sub- 
jects, I found the “Advance” dove 
neatly nestled amid elaborate flourishes 
on the penmanship page. The very 
word was beside the bird—but that’s 
rhyming! I have never found out why 
Big Sister selected this theme for a val- 
entine. So after all there was some- 
thing of delightful mystery about my 
gift even though the name of the sender 
was no secret.

THE Crisis 








* 






















Ww 





RUE friends of the Negro among 
the Nordic, are not so numerous 
that it will be inappropriate to tell you 
of another. It appears to me all the 
more appropriate to tell you of this 
friend since he died unknown and un- 
heralded as a friend of the black man. 
This unsung hero and friend is the 
late Major Charles L. Appleton of 
New York. 

Born an aristocrat, the scion of an 
old New York family, a graduate of 
Harvard, a member of exclusive New 
York town and country clubs, he at- 
tended the officer’s training school at 
Plattsburgh and was commissioned a 
captain of infantry. He was first as- 
signed to the 152d Depot Brigade at 
Camp Upton, N. Y., and later was 
made Supply Officer of the 367th In- 
fantry, the Buffaloes. This assignment 
gave him his first intimate contact 
with colored folk, except as servants 
in the hotels of Palm Beach, as even 
his house servants were white. In 
France he was promoted to be a Ma- 
jor and given command of the First 
Battalion of the Buffaloes, in which 
capacity he served throughout the war. 

He was by no means a genius at 
military tactics, but at least he was 
tactically efficient, sufficient to disre- 
gard—as he did on one occasion— 
poorly planned orders from division 
headquarters that meant slaughter to 
his men without military gain. He 
sought and depended upon the efh- 
ciency of his men, especially his Negro 
adjutant. He was not among the in- 
fluential and well known officers of 
the Ninety-Second division, but he had 
influence sufficient to save the Buf- 
faloes from returning from France led 
by that “white coward” who caused 
the bravery of the Negro officers in 
the “368th Infantry affair” to be ques- 
tioned. It was he, who with a picked 
squad returned the regimental colors 
of the Buffaloes to the Union League

An Unsung Hero 


CAPTAIN CHARLES H. GARVIN

Club in New York. He died Wed- 
nesday, December 16th, 1922, follow- 
ing an operation and was buried from 
the Church of the Incarnation on the 
following Friday, at Ipswich, Massa- 
chusetts. 

You ask, perhaps, after reading the 
above, why we call him a hero. He 
was a hero because he dared to “eat 
with his black officers’. Why should 
this make him a hero? In the 92nd 
Division during the World War it 
was an unwritten law that no black 
and white officer should be billeted un- 
der the same roof. It was much easier 
for a white officer to face a German 
machine gun than to face the ridicule 
of his white fellow officers, as he would 
be forced to if he was too friendly so- 
cially with his black officers. As far 
as I am able to ascertain he was the 
only white officer in the Ninety-Sec- 
ond division who consistently ate with 
his Negro officers at the same table, 
when there was a white officers’ mess 
available. 

This much belated article was 
prompted by a recent European trip, 
during which I spent two days tramp- 
ing over that sacred, blood-stained 
ground in front of fortified Metz, then 
German, now French, where our black

one road leading like an artery from 
the square, which is the heart of the 
town, rise the cotton mills, ugly, squat 
oblate buildings whence pale-faced 
children peep out rather sullenly on 
the life beyond their prison walls. 
Farther up this same red road one 
begins to catch sight of smooth and 


boys in the 92nd Division fought so 
valiantly, especially during the last 
three days of the war. They paid 
dearly in blood for every inch of 
ground gained. As I tramped through 
fields and over the roads—and they 
are still muddy—around Noveant-sur- 
Moselle and passed the big house on 
the main highway to Metz, which 
served as Battalion headquarters, my 
thoughts went back ten years. It was 
a few days after the armistice, when 
we were relaxing after those strenu- 
cus days, that the conversation that I 
am about to relate occurred. 

There were just three of us chat- 
ting after dinner, the Major, another 
officer and myself. He was asked the 
question: “Why is it, that despite 
opposition, propaganda and silent con- 
tempt (he was too much their peer to 
receive open abuse), do you continue 
to eat with your black staff?” He said 
that it was not an attempt upon his 
part to solve the “so called Negro prob- 
lem”, but that it was rather a selfish 
motive. “I eat with my staff because 
among them I find more comradeship 
and intellectual equality than I do 
among most of the white officers that 
I have come in contact with in the 
army.” His battalion officers were 
for the most part college bred men, 
several of whom were fellow alumni. 
He regarded these men as his equals 
and sought his associates on the same 
basis that most men seek theirs if the 
color question is not involved. 

You may say that this isn’t sufficient 
reason to make him a hero, but to us 
black officers in the A. E. F., with the 
many perplexing problems involving 
the color question, his actions meant 
courage to us in the struggle to be 
men as well as officers. Don’t you 
think under these circumstances he 
was a hero?

I saw it first four years ago, on 
July days, hot and red, made cool and 
bearable under the shade of the tower- 
ing trees. The college boasted then 
a large, old, comfortable dormitory 
and refectory, a beautiful chapel, a 
cottage serving as dormitory for both 
teachers and students, a Carnegie Li- 
brary and several recitation buildings. 
Naturally in July there were no 
classes—I was attending a Y. W. C. 
A. summer conference—but even so I 
received an impression of cultural en- 
deavor and ambition quite contrary to 
my preconceived notions of aims of 
colored Southern schools. 

Talladega is an A. M. A. school. 
That is, the American Missionary As- 
sociation sponsors its economy and its 
curriculum. In November last I was 
the grateful recipient of an invitation 
to visit Talladega anew. The occa- 
sion was the dedication of the Silsby 
Hall of Science and of Fanning Hall, 
the college refectory. This second 
occasion increased and confirmed my 
impression of four years’ earlier. “Tal- 
ladega is the coming, almost the ar- 
rived school of the South. Its Presi- 
dent, Frederick A. Sumner, is not 
striving for numbers. His desire is 
to conduct a first-class undergraduate 
school for about 600 students. The 
addition of these two buildings has 
added greatly to his equipment and 
teachers, writers and social workers 
came from Chicago, New Haven, 
Washington, D. C., Atlanta and New 
York to mark the improvement. 

The two buildings were fashioned 
according to the plans of a local 
builder, a graduate of Talladega. 
They stand porticoed and columned, 
visions of beauty in construction and 
line, against the vivid background of 
red and green so peculiar to the South. 
Each hall is in itself perfection. Its 
equipment boasts the last invention of 


Silsby Hall of Science 


modernity and Talladega’s prestige is 
thereby increased. 

Naturally equipment does not make 
a-college. The curriculum is the de- 
ciding factor. In the present com- 
pleteness of Talladega it is saying 
much to state that this school’s curri- 
culum outstrips its equipment. Work 
in the Sciences is conducted on a high 
level. The Mathematics’ Department 
is sturdy. French is my own field and 
naturally I was very much interested 
in the way in which this subject was 
taught. I found employed the latest 
and most approved methods backed by 


splendid training in phonetics, com- 


position and conversation and along 
all the lines which make the teaching 
of modern languages a much more ef- 
fective process than the lines of even 
ten years ago. 

Music flourishes here. Teachers 
both of voice and of instruments are 
of broad training and_ experience. 
There is a freshness, an unjaded qual- 
ity about the work of orchestra and 
choir which rewarded manyfold the 


wearying trip undergone by most of 
the visitors. Music and her sister 
Art have really taken up their abode 
in this marvellous school. On _ the 
Saturday of the days devoted to the 
dedication a pageant written by one 
of Talladega’s teachers was rendered 
by the students showing the inception 
and development of the institution. 
It was a beautiful piece of work, well- 
planned with noble words and high 
sentiments. And the actors, amateurs 
though they were, informed their in- 
terpretation with real fervor and feel- 
ing. 

Talladega has already had a notable 
past. An idea of the calibre of its in- 
fluence on its students may be formed 
when one recalls that among its alumni 
are William Pickens of New York, 
George Crawford of New Haven, 
Conn., and Juliette Derrigotte of 
Athens, Georgia and of New York. 
Its future bids fair to outstrip its past. 
May it be Alma Mater to many and 
increasingly illustrious souls.

THE CRISIS 





















F there is one word which comprises 
the attitude against which the fight 
of the N. A. A. C. P. is directed, it is 





_ the word Segregation. For that word 


implies the setting apart of human be- 
ings on the ground of superficial dif- 
ferences: of color or appearance; or 
even deeper differences summarised in 
the word Race. The Association has 
never taken the ground that all men 
are alike. It has championed their 
right to be what they are and to be 
accepted on a common ground of hu- 
manity. 


Segregation 


HE work of the Association is reg- 

istered in many avenues of attack 
upon segregation. Many of the re- 
sults of what it has been doing are 
intangible. The slow and_ subtle 
change of attitude which permits col- 
ored singers and writers and painters 
and business men and scientists to func- 
tion freely in America, is something 
that cannot be pinned down on paper. 
Neither is this change the work of any 
small group of individuals. Yet, that 
the work of the N. A. A. C. P. has 
been potent in accelerating this change 
is a demonstrable fact. ‘The work of 
the year 1927, now come to a close, 
may well illustrate. 

Two of the outstanding victories of 
the year were won before the Supreme 
Court of the United States. One of 
those victories was won in the so-called 
New Orleans segregation case. It 
will be recalled that a state law of 
Louisiana and a city ordinance of New 
Orleans, made it imperative for a col- 
ored home-seeker to obtain the writ- 
ten consent of all the residents before 
settling in a district predominantly in- 
habited by white people. This regu- 
lation, if put into practice would have 
constituted simon-pure segregation. It 
would have had the effect of confining 
colored people to their own district, a 
ghetto, in which they must not only 
live but receive their schooling, enter- 
tainment and other services of life. It 
was a further wedge of cleavage be- 
tween the races, thrusting them far- 
ther apart. 


Now the N. A. A. C. P. in 1917 
had carried a similar ordinance before 
the Supreme Court. The Louisville 
Segregation case is by now famous. 
For in that case, argued by the Asso- 
ciation’s President, Mr. Moorfield 
Storey, the Supreme Court established 
once and for all that any law or ordi-

soa wide 
nance establishing residential segrega- 
tion by race is unconstitutional. So 
that when the Louisiana and New Or- 
leans enactments were passed, the N. 
A. A. C. P. had a precedent to go on. 
It had the precedent of the Louisville 
Segregation case of 1917 which its 
president had won. And on the basis 
of that Louisville decision of 1917 the 
United States Supreme. Court invali- 
dated the Louisiana and the New Or- 
leans enactments. 

This victory by the N. A. A. C. P. 
of the year 1927, based upon the vic- 
tory it had won in 1917, suggests sev- 
eral things: first that the Louisville 
victory was a vital one, since it has 
been made the basis not alone of the 
New Orleans victory this year, but 
of one in Dallas, Texas, and of vic- 
tories in other cities in other years. 
Furthermore, it makes clear that had 
there been no N. A. A. C. P. to fight 
this issue of residential segregation 
there is probably not a large city in 
the United States in which segregation 
ordinances would not have been en- 
acted into law. Beyond constituting 
another clear-cut victory over segre- 
gation in its crudest form, the New 
Orleans victory before the Supreme 
Court establishes one of the functions 


of the Association. The N. A. A. ° 


C. P. before the ultimate organ of 
government in this country, the courts, 
is laying down the fundamentals of 
the Negro’s citizenship rights. And 
so long as the Negro is organized and 
ready to defend them, no power can 
take away from him these rights which 
the courts have affirmed and are ready 
to reaffirm whenever they are given 
opportunity. 
V otes 


HE second of the Association’s 

victories this year before the 
United States Supreme Court, was 
won in the Texas White Primary case. 
This case involved another form of 
segregation of which the Negro in the 
South particularly has been made the 
victim. This form of segregation is 
disfranchisement, the barring of men 
and women from the polls at elections 
because their skins are dark although 
they are in every way qualified to cast 
a ballot. The Texas White Primary 
case arose out of a Texas law of 1924 


which prohibited the voting of any 
colored people in the Democratic party 
primaries of the state. As the State 
of Texas is overwhelmingly Demo- 
cratic, the party primaries are the real 
election and the election itself is a 
mere formality ratifying what has been 
decided at the primaries. To deprive 
any citizen of the right to vote in the 
primaries is to bar him from the fran- 
chise as effectually as if he had no vote 
at all. This case was carried before 
the Supreme Court by the N. A. A. 
C. P. and the Supreme Court’s deci- 
sion, revalidating the provisions of the 
14th Amendment to the Constitution, 
declared that the primary was part 
of the election and that no American 
citizen may be barred from participat- 
ing therein because of his race or color. 


This decision applies to much more 
than the situation in Texas. For Ne- 
groes have been barred from party 
primaries in other states in the South, 
notably in Georgia. Moreover, it en- 
ables colored people to realize their 
determination to have a part in the 
choice of those who will represent 
them. In states where the Democratic 
party is overwhelmingly dominant it 
enables colored people to register and 
vote in the primaries of that party. 
Many colored people, as a consequence 
of the Supreme Court’s decision, have 
registered in the Democratic party in 
west Texas. And their votes will 
without doubt have an effect in de- 
termining the policies of that party. 
Perhaps in time, colored votes within 
the Democratic party will help to lib- 
erate that party from its slavish Civil 
War attitude founded upon oppres- 
sion of the Negro and injustice to all 
of the darker races in this country. 
If the Negro could, in the course of 
time, become a factor in Democratic 
party politics in the South, it would 
have a profound effect upon the Re- 
publican party in the North. It 
would serve notice in the most forcible 
way upon the Republican party of the 
North that the Civil War is now a 
long way off. And that in asking for 
gratitude it would be well for any 
party to be able to point to achieve- 
ments closer at hand than sixty years 
past. That is a development that is 
perhaps far off. But what has been 
established now is that no Southern 
state may bar colored voters from its 
Democratic party primaries on account 
of race. And this decision colored 
voters are already taking advantage of.

Schools 

_ ET us pursue a little farther the 
Association’s campaign against the 
segregation principle. The year 1927 
showed one victory over residential 
segregation and one over the segre- 
gated vote. Another point of attack 
has been the schools. It has long been 
realized that to implant the idea of 
race antagonism in young people is to 
lay the seeds of race dissension among 
adults. For this reason the N. A. A. 
C. P. has tirelessly opposed the ex- 
tension of the segregated school prin- 
ciple in the North. One such attempt 
occurred in Toms River, New Jer- 
sey, last spring and attracted the at- 
tention of the entire country. The 
N. A. A. C. P. was informed that 
colored children were being excluded 
from the public school there and were 
being herded in a building which was 
not only separate from the whites but 
unfit for use as a school being dark 
and unsanitary. The N. A. A. C. P. 
realizing that this was a case which 
not only deserved to be fought on its 
merits, but which might serve as a 
precedent in the Northern states if 
allowed to pass uncontested, retained 
an attorney, Mr. Eugene: R. Hayne, 
of Asbury Park. A hearing of protest 
was arranged before the Governor of 
New Jersey at which national officers 
of the N. A. A. C. P. were in attend- 
ance as well as representatives from 
most of the New Jersey branches. The 
case was carried both into the courts 
and before New Jersey’s Education 
Commission. The case was won de- 
cisively and the Commissioner of Edu- 
cation ordered that the colored chil- 
dren be restored to the school from 
which they had been illegally excluded. 
The case was given the widest pub- 


licity in the press and it was made. 


known to the country that colored 
people were opposed to the extension 
of the segregation principle in the 
schools; and what is more that they 
were prepared to fight it to a conclu- 
sive show-down. This was again made 
clear in Gary, Indiana, where the 
white students of the Emerson High 
School, inspired no doubt by the Klan 
spirit which is rife in that state, went 
on “strike” against the continued pres- 
ence in their school of upwards of a 
score of colored pupils. The city 
council, capitulating to this expression 
of mob spirit, voted $15,000 for the 
erection of a “temporary” segregated 
high school to house these colored stu- 
dents. Again the N. A. A. C. P,, 
both through its ably led and well- 
organized Gary branch and through 
the National Office, took this case to 
court. The expenditure of the $15,- 
000 Gary city funds, which were de- 
rived from the taxes paid by both col- 
ored and white citizens, for a segre- 
gated high school was enjoined. And 


50 


the Mayor of Gary finally realised 
that the position the city had taken 
was untenable. The city council re- 
scinded their appropriation. The in- 
junction against the segregated insti- 
tution was made permanent. And, as 
a price for the discontinuance of fur- 
ther court procedure, the city of Gary 
paid the cost of the legal proceedings 
which had been brought by the N. A. 
A. FF. 

Every one of the four cases thus 
far listed as part of the victorious 
achievement of the N. A. A. C. P. for 
the year 1927, has helped to establish 
and to strengthen a general principle. 
It is the principle that it is contrary 
to the American idea that human be- 
ings shall be deprived of any citizen- 
ship privileges, whether of right of 
residence, of voting, or of public 
schooling among their fellows because 
of the accident of race or color. Vir- 
tually every case fought by the N. A. 
A. C. P. depends upon the affirma- 
tion of this principle in one form or 
another. If a keystone of the Asso- 
ciation’s work were sought, it might 
be found in this consistent and per- 
sistent opposition to the segregation 
or “Jim Crow” spirit. 

A Race Riot 

THER of its outstanding achieve- 
ments in 1927 further illuminate 
this fact. During the year, it will be 
recalled that there were reports of a 
serious “race riot” which emanated 
from Coffeyville, Kansas. This so- 
called race riot was used to blacken 
the repute of the Negro race. It was 
attributed to the crime of two “Negro 
rapists”. The circumstances seemed 
so questionable that the N. A. A. C. 
P. employed an attorney who not only 
demonstrated that Negroes were not 
concerned in the disturbance but that 
white men had been the occasion of 
the trouble for which Negroes had 

been blamed. 

At Washington 

TILL another form of segregation, 
this time under the aegis of the 
national government was made a na- 
tional issue. Negroes during the past 
few years have been increasingly chaf- 
ing at the fact that men and women 
of their race, working in departments 
of the federal government in Wash- 
ington, were being set apart in work- 
rooms, deprived of stenographic ser- 
vices and otherwise treated as if they 
belonged to some sub-species of the 
human race. The Washington, D. C. 
Branch of the Association took the 
leadership in attacking this abuse. Un- 
der the guidance of its president, Mr. 
Neval H. Thomas, government offic- 
ers responsible for this condition were 
called upon and written to. The Na- 
tional Office also took a hand, calling 
the attention of President Coolidge by 
letter to this situation. And an early 





result of this agitation has been the 
reinstatement to their old posts of 
clerks in the Pension Bureau. 
Concubinage 
ERHAPS the most vicious form 
in which the segregation spirit 
manifested itself during the year, were 
the bills prohibiting intermarriage be- 
tween people of white and colored an- 
cestry, admittedly sponsored in north- 
ern states by the Ku Klux Klan. The 
N. A. A. C. P. receiving information 
from many sources of such measures, 
sent out a general warning to its 
branches. Strong delegations appeared 
at state houses and before legislative 
committees and the enactment of the 
anti-intermarriage laws was prevented 
in the states of Connecticut, Rhode 
Island, New Jersey, Massachusetts, 
Maine and Michigan. It was made 
clear to all concerned that the N. A. 
A. C. P. was not “advocating” inter- 
marriage as its opponents falsely 
charged, but that to prohibit inter- 
marriage was to write into law the 
“magna charta of concubinage and 
bastardy” and to deprive colored wo- 
men of all redress at the hands of 
white men. The position taken by the 
N. A. A. C. P. is that marriage is a 
private concern and it is the affair of 
society only insofar as individuals mar- 
rying may be compelled to observe the 
general laws applying to their rela- 
tionship. 
Into the South 
HE N. A. A. C. P. has not 
stopped with the North in its fight 
upon the segregation spirit. Both the 
Texas White Primary Case and the 
New Orleans Segregation case origi- 
nated in the South. It has carried 
its fight close to Southern states by 
opposing the extradition of fugitives 
from justice where there seemed strong 
doubt that a fair trial would be given 
in the South. The N. A. A. C. P. 
has the lynching record of every south- 
ern state for the past forty years. 
These records were forwarded to 
various northern cities throughout 
the country from which it was being 
sought to extradite a colored man to 
the South. One such extradition to 
Alabama was prevented from Wash- 
ington, D. C. Another was fought 
in the states of Illinois and Indiana 
and was terminated only when a Geor- 
gia sheriff, by collusion with Indiana 
police officers, kidnapped his prisoner 
from Northern jurisdiction. 
Moreover the N. A. A. C. P. fight 
has been carried into the South in a 
more direct way. Officers of the As- 
sociation have visited most of the 
Southern. states during the year, lec- 
turing, encouraging the colored people 
to organize and to stand for their 
rights as American citizens. N. A. 
A. C. P. officers during the year 1927 
have visited the (Turn to page 66)

ANY persons are under the im- 

pression that the N. A. A. C. P. 
has been the persistent enemy of Mar- 
cus Garvey. This is due to repeated 
accusations published in the Negro 
World without the slightest basis of 
fact. For the sake of the truth, it 
may be well to recall certain matters 
of clear record. 

Tue Crisis has published five ar- 
ticles on Marcus Garvey. The first 
two articles, March 1920 and January 
1921 ended with this summary: 

“To sum up: Garvey is a sincere, 
hard-working idealist; he is also a 
stubborn, domineering leader of the 
mass; he has worthy industrial and 
commercial schemes but he is an inex- 
perienced business man. His dreams 
of Negro industry, commerce and the 
ultimate freedom of Africa are feas- 
ible; but his methods are bombastic, 
wasteful, illogical and ineffective and 
almost illegal. If he learns by experi- 
ence, attracts strong and_ capable 
friends and helpers instead of making 
needless enemies; if he gives up secrecy 
and suspicion and substitutes open and 
frank reports as to his income and ex- 
penses, and above all if he is willing 
to be a co-worker and not a czar, he 
may yet in time succeed in at least 
starting some of his schemes toward 
accomplishment. But unless he does 
these things and does them quickly he 
cannot escape failure.” 


No more prophetic word was ever 
written about Marcus Garvey! 

The third and fourth articles dealt 
with the Black Star Line and the Uni- 
versal Negro Improvement Association 
and were based on published documents 
with little comment. 


It was not until September, 1922, 
that THe Crisis had a sharp word of 
criticism. This was based on Gar- 
vey’s threats against his critics, his con- 
nection with the Ku Klux Klan and 
his distribution of pamphlet propa- 
ganda against American Negroes. We 
quoted, among other things, this: 

“The white race can best help the 
Negro by telling him the truth, and 
not by flattering him into believing 
that he is as good as any white man.” 

Concerning this we said: 

“Not even Tom Dixon or Ben Till- 
man or the hatefullest enemies of the 
Negro have ever stooped to a more 
vicious campaign than Marcus Gar- 
vey, sane or insane, is carrying on. He 
is not attacking white prejudice, he is 
grovelling before it and applauding it; 
his only attack is on men of his own 
race who are striving for freedom; his 
only contempt. is for Negroes; his only 
threats are for black blood.” 


February, 1928 


Marcus Garvey And The N. A. A. C. P. 


On the other hand Garvey’s attacks 
on the N. A. A. C. P. have been con- 
tinuous, preposterous and false. He 
has claimed: 


1. That we kept his representative 
from activity in Paris in 1919. 

2. That Moorfield Storey came 
from Boston to secure his conviction 


in 1924. 


3. That the collapse of the Black 
Star Line came about “because men 
were paid to make this trouble by cer- 
tain organizations calling themselves 
Negro Advancement Associations. 
They paid men to dismantle our ma- 
chinery and otherwise damage it so as 
to bring about the downfall of the 
movement”, 


4. That the N. A. A. C. P. was 
responsible for his incarceration and 
deportation. 


Every single statement in these and 
dozens of similar charges are abso- 
lutely false and without any basis of 
fact whatsoever. As THe Crisis said 


in May, 1924: 


“No Negro in America ever had a 
fairer and more patient trial than 
Marcus Garvey. He convicted him- 
self by his own admissions, his swag- 
gering monkey-shines in the court 
room with monocle and long tailed 
coat and his insults to the judge and 
prosecuting attorney. 

“Marcus Garvey was long refused 
bail, not because of his color, but be- 
cause of the repeated threats and cold 


blooded assaults charged against his 
organization. He _ himself openly 
threatened to ‘get’ the District At- 
torney. His followers had repeatedly 
to be warned from intimidating wit- 
nesses and one was sent to jail there- 
for. One of his former trusted offi- 
cials after being put out of the Gar- 
vey organization brought the long con- 
cealed cash account of the organization 
to this office and we published it. 
Within two weeks the man was shot 
in the back in New Orleans and killed. 

“Everybody, including the writer, 
who has dared to make the slightest 
criticism of Garvey has been intimi- 
dated by threats and threatened with 
libel suits. Over fifty court cases 
have been brought by Garvey in ten 
years.” 

We are reminding our readers of 
all this not to revive forgotten rancor 
but for the sake of historical accuracy. 
When Garvey was sent to Atlanta, 
no word or action of ours accomplished 
the result. His release and deporta- 
tion was a matter of law which no 
deed or wish of ours influenced in the 
slightest degree. We have today, no 
enmity against Marcus Garvey. He 
has a great and worthy dream. We 
wish him well. He is free; he has a 
iollowing; he still has a chance to 
carry on his work in his own home 
and among his own people and to ac- 
complish some of his ideals. Let him 
do it. We will be the first to applaud 


any success that he may have.

TOOK a little walk with Joy 
Heart singing like the Dawn 
And then I turned to trace my steps 
But Sorrow drew me on. 


I took a little walk with Love— 

And O, the day was high, 

The road was winding, at the end 
Love turned—and passed me by. 


I took a little walk with Life 
Along a thorny way; 

Joy came, and Love, but as we went 
Death beckoned me—away.

I Walk the Residential Streets of 
Poorer Brooklyn 


By PHILIP VAN ORTEN 


WALK tthe sstreets_ this 

dreamy languor, 

The residential streets of poorer Brook- 
lyn: 

Streets sharp and straight as cowardly 
virtue, 

Streets of a people, pale and trite and 
prosaic, 

Streets of pattern-houses cut from nonen- 
tity, 

Houses without tradition, without age, 

Houses with window-eyes of death with 
open lids. 


night in 


And the windows, 
Windows that wear wrestled weeds like 
city lots, 


Windows dark-shaded as mean ambi- 
tions, 
Windows silhouetting shadows  gro- 


tesque in all perspective. 


And I wonder at the meanness of the 
multitudes, 

‘The isolated, inborn, ingrowing mean- 
ness, 

The meanness of self-satisfaction, 

Of patting mud around many, many 
mounds, 

Of little bankbooks, of little prayers, 

Of grown children letting parents serve 
them, 

Of bodies dreading danger. 


Se 


And I walk past the churches, 

Churches gaunt and godless, 

Churches like the empty shells of worm- 
eaten chestnuts, 

Churches that are the white flags of 
surrender. 


And in the houses, 

Far, deep, cloistered in the houses 

Are the people. 

Family groups of people, 

Isolated people, 

People squirming around in little square 
rooms, 

Squirming into little soft beds, 

Uttering automatic syllables, 

Thinking machine-made thoughts, 

Planning little pleasures of tomorrow, 

Mourning little misfortunes of yester- 
day, 

Burying little selves into little person- 
alities. 


And in the streets, 
Men cower along the shadows like old 
driftwood along canals, 

Youths congregate at corners like 
curses waiting fulfillment, 
Unmarried couples slouch into dens of 

debauchery. .. . 


And an old woman drifts along like a 
skeleton-leaf and mutters.

When in the tomb their all is laid 

And there returns 
No echoing of weal or woe; 
The strong hope on—

And yet— 


A little world within the world

Daily our heart’s high yearnings fade, 
Are buried! 

Then, new ones are made, 

Are crucified!

With no reaction only an ennui; 

So rouse your slugeard legs, and pres-

Where fairies curl themselves in fronds

Se 
PERSONAL 


@ The monument erected at Atlanta, 
Ga., in honor of the late Bishop L. H. 
Holsey, was unveiled on November 
17. Bishop Holsey was born on a 
plantation near Columbus, Ga., in 
1842. His clerical career began in 
1870 when he was a delegate to the 
organization Conference of the C. M. 
E. Church which was held at Jack- 
son, Tenn. In 1873 at Augusta, Ga., 
he was elected a bishop of the church 
which he had helped organize three 
years before. 


@ Alford H. Tavernier, a colored 
man of Springfield, Mass., has been 
inducted into office as member of the 
Common Council of that city on Janu 
ary 2. 

@ After a one year lecture tour of 
the United States, Max Yergan, Ne- 
gro Y. M. C. A. secretary with the 
National Council of the Y. M. C. A., 
is preparing to return to South Africa. 
Mr. Yergan has received $25,000 from 
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., toward the 
erection of buildings which will serve 
as a center for the training of Negro 
leaders at Alice, Cape Province, S. A. 


@ Thomas W. Fleming, who was re- 
cently elected for an eighth term in 











the Cleveland, Ohio, City Council, 
is the oldest member of point of ser- 
vice in the council. He is chairman 
of the Police and Fire Committee and 
a member of the Finance, Judiciary 
and Steam Railroads Committees. 

q E. J. Gregg, who was elected to 
the Cleveland City Council for a first 
term during the fall elections, was 
born in Tennessee forty-six years ago 
and was educated at Walden Univer- 
sity and Meharry Medical College. 

@ Clayborne George, a Cleveland at- 
torney, was also elected for a first 
term during the fall elections. Mr. 
George’s election was the most signifi- 
cant of all three as he had bolted the 
Republican ticket and ran as an In- 
dependent. His election is significant 
for the future of Negro suffrage. 

@ These three councilmen in Cleve- 
land owe their seats to two causes: 
segregation, which has caused the 
massing of Negroes in compact areas; 
and a growing determination on the 
part of colored voters to make their 
ballots more effective.

School of Social Work have recently 
accepted positions in social. service. 
They are: Miss Alice Thomas, who 
has been appointed Girls’ Work Sec-

@. The Fourth Pan-African Congress, 
held in New York last August, was 
recently reproduced in miniature at 
the Central Library of Portland, 
Ore. Among the speakers were Dr. 
Parsons, of the University of Oregon 
and President Coleman, of Reed Col-

‘n charge of the affair. Charts, books, 
art and literature concerning the Ne- 
gro were on exhibit. 

@ The Gilpin Players of Cleveland, 
Ohio, early in December presented 
three one act plays: “Blackbeard” 
and “White Dresses” by Paul Green; 
and “Fingerbowls and Araminta” by 
Harry L. Hamilton. 

@ On December 9 the Armstrong 
Association and the American Friends 
Service Committee of Philadelphia, 
Pa., sponsored a third tour through 
the Negro business and residential sec- 
tions of Philadelphia. These tours 
are organized for the purpose of bet- 
ter acquainting the white public with 
worthwhile phases of Negro life and 
activity. 

@ An inter-racial, international and 
intercollegiate debate between a team 
from Lincoln University, Pa., and one 
from the National Students’ League of 
England, took place in New York City 
recently. The subject for debate was: 
“Resolved that the attitude of the 
Anglo-Saxon race toward the colored 
races under its control is unethical and 
prejudicial to progress”. The Eng- 
lish team upheld the negative and, in 
keeping with English custom, the de- 
bate was not judged. 

@ Negro fraternity and sorority cir- 
cles in the United States have received 
an invitation from the Mme. C. J. 


Walker Manufacturing Co. of Indian- - 


apolis, Ind., to be its guests at a na- 
tional Pan Hellenic Council in 1928. 
@ The annual report of the Trinity 
Building and Loan Association of 
Ardmore, Pa., for the fiscal year end-

of the State University, it was found 
that not one had received the equiva- 
lent of a high school education and 
only three were rated as of high school

@ Eight clubs among colored women 
have been organized in Seattle, Wash., 
for intellectual, social and _philan- 
thropic uplift. This year the Thurs- 
day Study Club is discussing Negro 
poets; the Self Improvement Club is 
supporting a bed in the Children’s Or- 
thopedic Hospital; and the Commu- 
nity Club has presented two plays. 


@ The Commission in Interracial Co- 


operation, with headquarters in At- 
lanta, Ga., announces the offer of three 
cash prizes of $100, $65 and $35 re- 
spectively for the best papers on the 
subject of race relations submitted by 
students of Southern colleges during 
the school year 1927-28. For fur- 
ther information write R. B. Eleazer, 
Educational Director, 409 Palmer 
Building, Atlanta, Ga. 

@ The Federal Council of Churches 
of Christ in America has chosen Feb- 
ruary 12 as Race Relations Sunday. 
@ Approximately 700 Negro girls are 
organized in 28 Girl Scout troops 
throughout the country. It is the pol- 
icy of the national office to refer all 
questions of truop organization to the 
Local Councils, which accounts for 
the few troops organized in the South. 


MUSIC AND ART 


@ In the moving picture “Uncle 
Tom’s Cabin”, which has recently 


February, 1928 





come out of Hollywood, the leading 
role, “Uncle Tom”, is played by James 
B. Lowe. It is a different conception 
from the Uncle Tom of tradition and 
Mr. Lowe is a finished actor of fine 
presence. He succeeded Mr. Gilpin, 
who was originally cast for this role. 


@ A fund of $1,500 was pledged re- 
cently by the Gilpin Players, the Afri- 
can Art Sponsors and friends to pur- 
chase African art for Cleveland, Ohio. 
This is the first fund of its kind to be 
raised in the United States. 


@ The Allied Art Players of Boston, 
Mass., under the direction of Mrs. 
Maud Cuney Hare, presented two 
plays early in December: “Polly 
Wakes Up” by Alvira Hazzard of 
Boston, and “Plumes” by Georgia 
Douglass Johnson of Washington, 
~ % 


@ The exhibit of the work of Negro 
artists held recently at the Interna- 
tional House, New York City, under 
the auspices of the Harmon Founda- 
tion, had a threefold purpose: to create 
a wider interest of the general public 
in the work of Negro artists; to stimu- 
late Negro artists in the fine arts; and 
to encourage the general public in the 
purchase of productions of Negro ar- 
tists. 

@ The Harmony Kings have been 
singing successfully in England. They 
are: V. H. Browning, John S. Crabbe, 
Charles E. Drayton and William H. 
Berry. 

@ Mr. Roland Hayes sang in Wig- 
more Hall, London, November 17th 
for the first time in many months. It 
is reported that his “voice and the ex- 
quisite art with which it is used are 
as compelling as ever”. His program 
included Schubert, Rachmaninoff, 
Griffes and Negro folk songs. 


EDUCATION 


@ The General Education Board of 
New York City has recently appro- 
priated $100,000 to Prairie View State 





Dr. F, F’, Burnett, page 54 


College, Prairie View, Texas, towards 
a permanent improvement program of 


$360,000. 


@ The 65th annual report of the 
Penn Normal, Industrial and Agri- 
cultural School, shows a total enroll- 
ment of 239 for the school year 1926- 
27. Among the clubs and committees 
sponsored by the Community Coun- 
cil of the school are: athletics, better 
homes, forestry, library, parents’ as- 
sociation, public health, Y. W. C. A., 
and Y. M. C. A. : 


@ In November the Stenographers’ 
Institute of Philadelphia, Pa., pur- 
chased two additional pieces of prop- 
erty at a cost of $13,000 to be added 
to the present school building. The 
new annex will afford room for the 
school’s multigraphing equipment, 
typewriters, assembly room and a cafe- 
teria, 


@ Miss Olivia Stokes of New York 
who died in Washington, D. C., in 
December, left the bulk of her $3,- 
000,000 estate to charitable and pub- 
lic institutions throughout this coun- 
try and China. The largest single 
bequest is $125,000 to Tuskegee In- 
stitute. Of this sum, $25,000 is to 
form the “Booker T. Washington 
Scholarship Fund”. 


@ With the opening of the winter 
quarter of the Colorado State Teach- 
ers’ College at Greeley, Col., two 
young colored women took charge of 
classes of the training school composed 
entirely of white pupils. Miss Helen 
Gansler, a junior, is instructing the 
second year high school class in folk 
dancing and Miss Olive Douglas, a 
sophomore, is teaching games to a 
group of first year high school girls.

Supreme Court at Pretoria has, 
however, refused to exempt Kad- 
alie himself from the insulting pass 
laws. 


@ A commercial intelligence bu- 
reau to represent the British Gold 
Coast has been established in Lon- 
don. Advertisements sent out 
stress the fact that the Gold Coast 
during the past quarter of a cen- 
tury has been raised from com- 
parative obscurity to a position of 
great economic importance. She 
produced last year 344,933 tons of 
manganese ; 299,835 carats of dia- 
monds and 219,000 ounces of 
gold; 230,840 tons of cocoa; 
1,680,406 cubic feet of timber; 
12,474,028 pounds of _ kola; 
1,752,000 tons of palm oil; and 7,658 
tons of palm kernels; besides copra, 
cotton and sisal hemp. She has 





500 miles of railway; a fine hos- 
pital and the beginning of a new uni- 
versity for Negroes. She imported in 
1926, 337,000 tons of material and 
exported 661,000 tons. The revenue 
during the fiscal year 1926-7 was 
£4,200,000. 


@ In Sierra Leone the government 
has at last assumed the burden of pay- 
ing for the larger part of the primary 
education given. It pays the salaries 
of the teachers, grants scholarships, 
makes loans toward the buildings and 
gives some subsidies for other ex- 
penses. 


@ In Sierra Leone for a long time 
jury trial and the right of appeal could 
be denied Negroes. Dr. Bankole 
Bright succeeded in making public this 
state of affairs in England. As a re- 
sult the Legislative Council in Sierra 
Leone has discussed but defeatéd a 
motion to repeal the offending ordi-

AXTON HIBBEN’S “Henry 

Ward Beecher”, (Doran), is a 
thrilling book. It is as fascinating as 
any novel I ever read. But the sig- 
nificance of this “American Portrait” 
is beyond its entertaining style and 
broad marshalling of authorities. 

Often we Negroes in our inner 
whisperings despair of ourselves. 
Turning our backs to the white 
listener, we gossip of theft and lazi- 
ness, murder and adultery, cruelty and 
double dealing; and we shudder: “My 
God! We're lost, we’re nothing, we 
never will be like white folks!” And 
the white folks we want to be like 
are noble, pure Gods. They sit on 
horseback and wave their swords like 
George Washington; they stand silent, 
stern and sorrowful in long black coats 
like Lincoln; they preach the Word 
in unsullied purity like Moody. 

Then comes a revealing flash. Some 
white man who has been pictured as 
perfect is shown to be human, vulner- 
able; a wavering, struggling sinner, 
whose life was not a parade but a bat- 
tle. Thus Hibben paints Henry Ward 
Beecher. The first reaction of the 
white world is to cry, “Shame!” If 
this portrait is true, suppress it; leave 
us not the truth-as-it-was about the 
Washington, Lincoln, Grant and 
Beecher; but the truth-as-it-ought-to- 
have-been, according to our present 
ideals. And black folk say: “I told 
you so—all white men are rotten— 
hypocrites, liars and tyrants. We are 
as good as they are, not by the heights 
we climb, but by the depths they 
reach.” 

Both superficial judgments are 
wrong. Paxton Hibben has painted 
a man human, even as we are all hu- 
man. A great spirit and gifted pro- 
phet and yet cautious, with ear to the 
ground; a man qf bounding imperious 
physical appetites and yet one who 
loved God and his fellow men. The 
terrible struggle of this torn soul, be- 
tween heaven and hell is a stupendous 
drama; but it is neither unusual nor 
exceptional, save its breadth and in- 
tensity. Physical passion is as human 
as spiritual sacrifice and when we 
knowingly distort truth and paint na- 
tional heroes as impossible paragons, 
we are not setting ideals for children 
and black folk, we are simply slapping 
poor, striving, human nature in the 
face. 

Many Negroes will be disappointed 
to learn that Beecher was no original

abolitionist and that his continual sale 
of pretty slave girls from the Plymouth 
pulpit was largely vaudeville. And 
yet the tremendous influence of this 
mighty leader of men did smooth the 
way for the freedman and put his 
plight before the hearts of millions. 
Without the voice of Beecher, eman- 
cipation and enfranchisement might 
have been impossible. 

Mr. Hibben, the author, has no par- 
ticular sympathy for Negroes. He 
says of that stormy petrel, Virginia 
Woodhull: “She was running for 
President on a ticket with Frederick 
Douglass—an astounding combination 
in that (or any other) day”. Why 
so “astounding” and in any “other 
day”? Also Mr. Hibben (or is it 
Doran?) spells it “negro”! 

William H. Jones’ “Recreation and 
Amusement Among Negroes in Wash- 
ington, D. C.” (Howard University 
Press) is valuable chiefly in opening 
a field for unprejudiced and inform- 
ing inquiry. 

The really important studies con- 
tained in the book have been padded 
with too much generalization. For 
instance, two pages are given to recrea- 
tion in the home. Most of this tells 
us that: “The home is the ideal cen- 
ter of informal recreation. It sym- 
bolizes relaxation and spontaneity. It 
is the one place where the individual 
can shake off his formality, free him- 
self, more or less, from conventional- 
ity and become natural.” Then comes 
the meat: of 661 homes studied, 546 
had a piano or a phonograph. 

Among the recommendations are 
many for better recreational privileges 
and one which asks: “That the rigid 
barriers against Negro attendance at 
the leading theaters and other public 
institutions in the downtown district 
be removed. This gross discrimina- 
tion by white persons practically ex- 
cludes Negroes entirely from certain 
higher forms of the city’s cultural 
life.” 

Miss Alice Werner of the Univer- 


sity of London sends us a “First 


a 
THE BROWSING READER | 





Swahili Book”, which is a primer of 
the most widely spread African 
tongue on the East Coast. It shows 
the extraordinary ingenuity and flexi- 
bility of the African languages. Take 
the verb “to carry”. One has all these 
tenses to express: I am carrying, | 
carry, I carried, I have carried, and 
he carried, and I carried, he shall or 
will carry, if when he carried, I am 
in the habit of carrying, I would carry, 
I would have carried, even if I carried, 
etc., through five other tenses. .

IN THE MAGAZINES 
FRITZ CASTLEREIGH in jack- 


ass for January, 1928, says of ““Countée 


Cullen”: 


“a throat that choking with its golden 
paeans 

of jungle blood that surges through 
his veins 

regurgitates triumphantly the poems 


that tramp their rhythms on _ our 
brains” 
“The Negro: Is He a Biological 


Inferior?” is discussed by J. M. 
Rheinhardt in the American Journal 
of Sociology for September. One by 
one Mr. Rheinhardt breaks down the 
arguments in support of the assump- 
tion that there are potential differences 
between Caucasian and Negro. The 
only difference which can be admitted 
legitimately is the superior advantage 
the white man has over the Negro in 
the present social scheme, which gives 
rise to biases and prejudices. In con- 
clusion, Mr. Rheinhardt shatters the 
myth that the Negro is an imitator 
by calling attention to the records of 
Negro invention in the United States 
and to the rich store of folk lore and 
song which indicate a fruitful future 
for the Negro in literature and music. 
Cloyce K. Huston in Travel for 
January, 1928, takes us “On Trek in 
the Black Sudan”. Mr. Huston de- 
scribes the country along the tree 
shadowed Nile and the natives in the

Nordic sentimentality. He says that 
the women are easily flattered by the 
attention of pale-faced travelers and 
make pointed overtures to them.

A CHRISTMAS READING 
A FRIEND writes: 


“In the sacred places of my soul I 
have stowed away a few unforgettable 
experiences. Yesterday, at Howard, I 
added one more; and one reason for 
such classification was the fact—no 
doubt— that it had to do mostly with 
young people; another, that they were 
Negroes. 

“This occasion was the reading of 
‘The Other Wise Man’ by Mary P. 
Burrill at Howard Universty chapel, for 
which the candle-light processional and 
the altogether remarkable music of the 
student chorus furnished a most beauti- 
tul and harmonious setting. Glorious 
voices, beauty; and the utmost perfec- 
tion of detail everywhere. That last, of 
course, makes a perfect whole. Indeed 
my memory of the entire program is 
akin to that of a jewel without a flaw; 
but it is something quite impossible to 
describe. Words I should have to use 
would appear over-praise, when as a 
matter of fact they would be entirely in- 
adequate,—so, why attempt the impos- 
sible! 

“But I would like to frame a tithe 
of my appreciation of Miss Burrrill, 
who added to the charm of Van Dyke’s 
noble words the equal charm of a rare 
personality and dramatic genius of a 
high order. Literally, she held the au- 
dience in the palm of her hand. Espe- 
cially did the bloc of three hundred or 
so girls, the candle bearers, show, by 
their rapt attention, the magic of her 
words. They took my attention, several 
times, from the speaker. There was 
represented, beauty and vitality, poise, 
power and intelligence, and innate good 
breeding. It represents, too, an asset 
none the less worth while because so 
generally unremarked. For in such qual- 
ities of mind and soul lie great possibili- 
ties for this country of ours. 

“It seemed but a few moments—such 
had been our absorption—when the can- 
dles were again lighted. These candles 
and the illuminated star over the plat- 
form, gave the only light as the white 
clad bearers filed slowly out of the 
chapel, followed by the surpliced choir. 

“The friend with me, to whom- this 
had been an entirely new experience, 
said, with tears in her eyes and a catch 
in her voice, ‘I have been moved to the 
depths by all this. I want to go home 
and live it all over again.’ ” 


4 RACE SYMPOSIUM 


ARIAN WHEELOCK LEWIS 
of Rockford College, Rockford, 
Illinois, writes us of a “glorious dis- 
cussion of race relations’ that took 


February, 1928 


place at the Chicago Forum meeting, 
November 20: 

“On Sunday afternoon, November 20, 
the Chicago Forum held a wonderfully 
animated discussion of a problem which 
to many seems the most vital in the 
modern world, the problem of race re- 
lations. Three men spoke, a white man, 
a black man and a yellow man. Each, 
so the program said, was to speak for 
his own race, but as a matter of fact 
each spoke for all races.” 

Mr. Stanley High of Boston was the 
first speaker. Studying race relations 
everywhere on his recent trip around the 
world, he was struck by the universal 
collapse of the racial superiority of the 
white man, by the “decline of docility” 
on the part of other peoples. “The races 
of the world”, he said, “are cutting the 
apron-strings of the whites. With their 
bodies they may still be scraping for us; 
but with their spirits they’re dreaming— 
and—going to night school!” 

“The white man is still doing his best 
to maintain a free-booting tradition ir 
the non-white world. We still shoot 
straight. And we, know how to profit. 
But the situation is changing. Other 
peoples are starting out on their own 
roads to their own destinations. “The 
booted is turning to booter.’” 

Mr. High said that the world move- 
ments effecting this collapse of the do- 
cility of other races to the whites had 
three causes: communism, democracy 
and Christianity, although he added, “In 
the sense I use ‘Christianity’, the world 
cannot be both white and Christian.” 
He ended by declaring: 

“The first thing that brands the 
white man is his own proclamation of 
his superiority. That’s for other races 
to say. We go around the world pound- 
ing our breasts, and asserting our su- 
periority under one guise or another. 
The very temper of our insistance re- 
veals our so-called superiority as merely 
a complex.” 

James Weldon Johnson, Executive 
Secretary of the N. A. A. C. P. spoke 
next and said among other-things: 


“How were we able to take Haiti in 
1915, and to hold it since, without 
shocking the American conscience, unless 
we thought the Haitians an_ inferior 
people, unfit to govern themselves.? This 
attitude, the real and basic one, is in 
such cases metamorphosed, rationalized 
if you will, into the attitude of beneficent 
Christianity. 

“There are other races in the world 
with superiority complexes too! The 
Negro has one. Do you know that he 
thinks that if he had the economic power 
the white man has, he would use it with 
less cruelty than at times characterizes 
its use by the whites? He may be 


wrong. I don’t doubt that he is. I have 
not come here to put the halo around his 
head.” 

Dr. Ping Wen Kuo of Columbia Uni- 
versity and the former President of 
Shanghai College of Commerce, gave the 
last speech of the afternoon. 

Dr. Kuo ‘stressed the far-reaching 
effects of Chinese civilization in the 
Western world. He alluded to the com- 
pass and the discovery of America; to 
printing and paper-making and the Prot- 
estant Reformation. 

After admitting the objection that 
China’s government is not stable, Dr. 
Kuo reached a tremendous climax in 
this challenge: “You grow strong and 
we'll set you free!” say the nations. “Ah, 
but you set us free, and we'll grow 
strong!” we answer. 

“Now there are a lot of you who say 
you love us. It is very sweet of you. 
And we want love. But we want just- 
ice too. And if you can’t give us both, 
then we prefer that you take back a 
little of your love and give us a little 
more justice.” 


NEGRO'‘LIFE INSURANCE 


M. HAYES, president of the 
e Gibraltar Health and Acci- 
dent Insurance Company, Indian- 
apols, Ind., has made a report to the 
National Negro Insurance Association,

Negro Insurance business. He de- 
clares: “The business of life insur- 
ance is the largest business that is 
owned, operated and controlled by 
Negroes.” His report is based on the 
amzual statements of twenty-five com- 
panies who are members of the Asso- 
ciation together with statistical data 
from three other Negro companies. 
The financial statements are as of De- 
cember 1, 1926.

Mr. Hayes makes certain interesting 
comparisons, For instance, 281 white 
insurance companies show that 30 per 
cent of their gross income was net 
while only 10 per cent of the gross 
income of colored insurance societies 
is net: 


“This difference in the percent of net 
income may be accounted for in part, 
by the programs of expansion of the 
young Negro companies, where, in many 
instances the costs was as high as one 
hundred and forty percent (140%) of 
the premium income; and to a greater 
percent of waste due, in a large measure, 
to inadequate supervision and a greater 
duplication of effort on the part of the 
Negro companies.” 


The average per cent of actual to 
expected mortality in 14 of the com- 
panies was 84.3 per cent: 

“This apparent favorable mortality 
experience, however, should not be a 
cause for exuberance or Over joy, as re- 
ports from some of the older companies 
showed their actual mortality to be as 
high as one hundred and thirty-eight 
percent (138%) of the expected. 

The colored companies are evidently 
failing to gather proper figures of mor- 
tality experience. Only 7 of the com- 
panies submitted such figures and the 
numbers of exposures and deaths given 


60 


by these were too small to furnish any 
definite idea of mortality. The col- 
ored companies have therefore still to 
depend on reports of colored deaths in 
white companies. These show that the 
ratio of actual to expected mortality is 
about 116 per cent although some 


.tables put it much higher than this. 


Only 2 colored insurance companies 
are doing real life extension work, the 
Afro-American Life Insurance Com- 
pany, of Jacksonville, Fla., and the 
Unity Industrial Life Insurance Com- 
pany of New Orleans, La.

PRIZES 
I shall announce in the March 
Crisis, the winners of the 
Charles Waddell Chesnut Honor- 
arium for contributions to THE CRISIS 
during the year 1927; and the Krigwa 
prizes for 1928. 


THE PRAYER-BOOK 
OTHING is so expressive of 
modern decadent tendencies as the 
Prayer-book upheaval in England. It 
is a little out-dated scrap of Mediaeval- 
ism and centers mainly around the dis- 
position of a bit of bread and wine, 
“blessed” by Mumbo-Jumbo. Can this 
be set aside for a sick man to pray at 
and is this idolatry? What of it? Ap- 
parently everything. Strong men in 
tears, statesmen in antics of wrath, 
parties disrupted and the world’s 
greatest empire in throes of dismay. 
While that-same England is unmoved 
by starving miners, child-slavery in 
South Africa, the disfranchisement of 
a few hundred million Indians and a 
world armed for murder and war. 
And yet they call this White Civiliza- 
tion! 
ALBERT RICE 

HE blow that Albert Rice of 

Washington has dealt the younger 
literary movement is a severe one. De- 
liberately and without excuse he sent 
to Counteé Cullen’s anthology of 
Negro verse (“Caroling Dusk”) a 
poem which he had stolen from the 
work of a white man published years 
ago. The colored world and the 
Washington group in particular should 
drive this young thief out from the 
congregation of the decent. 


HOUSTON 


To the Officers and Members of the 
National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People: 


COUNT it a pleasure to thank you 
on behalf of the former members of 
the 24th Infantry, convicted for the al- 
leged participation in the so-called 
ouston race riot of 1917, for the un- 


tiring work you have done on our be- 
half, 


February, 1928 


We feel that in a great measure, if 
not entirely, we are indebted to the 
N. A. A. C. P. for our freedom. 

Your organization was on the job 
before the ink that gave the news of 
the riot to the country had dried and 
has remained there since, fighting for 
justice. 

The pilgrimage of the members and 
friends of the Advancement Associa- 
tion to the Federal Prison during your 
Conference of 1923 was an inspira- 
tion to our drooping spirits. “Che im- 
pression that you left with us cheered 
us for many days thereafter. 

Your unremitting toil on our behalf 
after that visit need not be recounted 
here. 

The work and cooperation of the 
branches was indeed commendable and 
is proof positive of the advantages of 
crganized effort. You have nobly kept 
the piedge you made to us on that 
visit: “We will fight until you are all 
out or dead.” My earnest prayers and 
wishes are that twelve million Negroes 
may become members of this fighting 
organization which has never ceased to 
contend for justice and agains: preju- 
dice and intolerance. 

I know no better way by which we 
can keep faith with those of our race 
who have been crucified upon the cross 
of prejudice than by joining and sup- 
porting this fighting organization 
whose recent victories before the high- 
est tribunal in the world ought to en- 
shrine it in the hearts of the entire 
race. 

Very gratefully and respectfully sub- 
mitted, 

(Signed) James R. HAwKINs. 


SEVILLE 


SEE the winding of the narrow 

Calle Sierpes as I am tossed through 
it into the tower and the cathedral. 
The tower, Giralda of the Moors, is 
faintly yellow, tall and graceful, laced 
in Arabesque; it is simple and beauti- 
ful with its bells. The cathedral 
stands with the rich colors of evening 
pouring down upon it. In the center 
is the great carved choir, and through 
it comes the chanting of priests and 
boys and the faint smell of incense. 
There are immense and _ sombre 
shadows and the grave of the son of 



















































Christopher Columbus. Lovely are 
the gardens of the Alcazar and of the 
palace with its great white Court of 
the Young Maidens and golden Hall 
of the Ambassadors. ‘There are orange 
trees and tile benches in the park of 
Maria Louisa, and then one drops 
down to the busy Guadalquiver—the 
busy, hurrying CGuadalquiver—filled 
with the shipping of Spain and the 
world. 


SOCIAL EQUALITY 
OTHROP STODDARD, pro- 


fessional “nigger” hater and pro- 
tagonist of the Ku Klux Klan, made 
two astonishing admissions the other 
night when he debated the subject of 
social equality with the Editor of THE 
CRISIS. 

The first was this: ‘The basic rea- 
son for white America’s attitude and 
policy toward the Negro is not a be- 
lief in the Negro’s inferiority, but the 
fact of his difference.”. This is a shift- 
ing of ground which was bound to 
come, but we had not expected it so 
soon or from such a source. 

No sooner, however, had Mr. Stod- 
dard made this admission, than he was 
faced with this statement from Mr. 
Du Bois. 

“Mr. Stoddard declares that his 
chief solicitude is to preserve racial 
differences. Very well. Preserve them. 
But do not wreck civilization in so 
doing. Be generous and truthful in 
your estimate of other races. Give 
them every chance for development 
and open recognition of their accom- 
plishment. Meet them as men. Talk 
with them. Confer with them. Only 
in this way can the differences be ap- 
preciated and understood and used for 
the glory of mankind. 

“If you wish to invite black men 
or yellow men to dinner, do so. If 
you do not, refrain from it; but do not 
shut restaurants in their faces; and 
should you meet them at someone’s 
else table, act as though you were a 
gentleman. 

“All this; and beyond this no one 
need go unless they wish. If any 
white person does not want to marry 
a colored person, no one is going to 
compel him. If he is asked, he has 
simply to say no. 


61

SRR 












“If Mr. Stoddard were speaking 
pontifically for everybody in the white 
race, there would be absolutely no 
need of his silly bi-racial program. 
But, of course, Mr. Stoddard has no 
business to speak for every single white 
person just as I cannot speak for all 


black people. Now what are you go- 
ing to do with the white man who is 
determined to marry a black woman? 
Shall you put him in jail, as in Mis- 
sissippi? That method has been tried 
and failed. What we black Americans 
suggest is, that if they want to get 
married, let them be married, openly 
and legally. 

“We assume that there are com- 
paratively few black and white people 
in the United States, who want to get 
married; we believe that if marriage 
is free, and social intercourse takes 
place on the highest and best levels, 
that, insofar as there are good and suf- 
ficient reasons in science and taste to 
keep people from marrying outside of 
their particular group, such marriages 
will not take place in the vast major- 
ity of cases. It would be an astound- 
ing admission, and the utter negation 
of his own argument, if Mr. Stoddard 
had to admit that free social inter- 
course among intelligent white and col- 
ored people in the United States was 
going to lead to wholesale intermar- 
riage. 

“I believe that there would be less 
intermingling of blood between the 
white and black group in the United 
States under the open abolition of the 
color line, than there is today under 
its futile and impossible enforcement. 
If the granting of social equality and 
equal opportunity for black folk would 
lead to making America a nation of 
octoroons, then this would be over- 
whelming proof that white people of 
the United States wanted a thing 
which Mr. Stoddard is carefully and 
elaborately denying, and with which 
denial I perfectly agree. 


“Tt is unfortunate that most white 
people arguing this question always 
leap straight to this extreme problem 
of the amalgamation of races. I ask 
for a decent seat in the theater, and 
my white neighbor answers, ‘Do you 
want to marry my daughter?’ And 
if I protest that really that wasn’t in 
my mind, he looks at me suspiciously 
and then says: ‘Well, what is it 
that you Negroes do want?’ His 
whole attitude and implication is, that 
as a matter of fact, what Negroes want 
is intermarriage and amalgamation. 

“In truth, what they want is equal- 
ity and opportunity. If a group finds, 
that in the long run, it can only get 
equal treatment by disappearing as a 
group, it disappears, and nothing that 
Mr. Stoddard or any of his friends 
can do, will keep America from be- 


62 


coming octoroon if they persist in the 
present drawing of the color line. On 
the other hand, if the time comes when 
an American can be black and have 
the same opportunities as though he 
were white, why should he change the 
color of his skin? Does Mr. Stod- 
dard really think that white people 
are so obviously and remarkably more 
gifted, good and beautiful than black 
people or brown people or yellow peo- 
ple, that these darker races are trying 
to commit racial suicide?” 

And what does Mr. Stoddard an- 
swer? His answer is, in effect: “If 
the higher classes should give Negroes 
this treatment socially, see how much 
intermarriage it would lead to among 
the mass of people!” 

Or, in other words, the only way 
to keep the mass of white Americans 
from marrying Negroes is to lie about 
Negroes and lynch them and insult 
them. This proves what we have al- 
ways said: the guilt for lynching lies 
not on the morons and criminals who 
pull the rope, it lies at the door of 
the educated and thoughtful Christians 
of America who refuse to attack race 
prejudice even when they know it is 
based on a lie. 


OKOLONA 
Y dear Dr. Du Bois: 

In reading last night in this 
cottage by the Lake the last issue of 
Tue Crisis I was surprised and de- 
lighted to find a partial but clear and 
fine statement printed in it of the Bas- 
kin murder that occurred May 20th, 
1925, in Okolona, Mississippi. A letter 
from me to the former Treasurer of the 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People, whose home 
is in Amenia, Duchess County, New 
York, is quoted without giving my 
name. I think I deserve credit for 
exactly what I have for three years 
time done in that matter.- The pub- 
lic sentiment of the entire civilized 
world, I believe, will in time condemn 
this infernal, horrible murder. 

I think, however, that the greatest 
good could come to the cause of human 
justice, to which I have given gratuit- 
ously more than half a century of 
mortal life and the best efforts of my 
heart and brain under constant prayer 
for guidance by the Divine Spirit, if 
you were to state at the same time a 
few significant facts regarding the 
principles on which I have acted gen- 
erally, and in this particular case of 
terrible wrong inflicted on a colored 
man who was simply performing his 
duty as he understood it in protecting 
the school herd of goats and sheep from 
destruction by a ferocious bull dog and 
so far as Baskin was concerned of un- 
known ownership. You ought to read 
my correspondence with certain mem- 
bers of the Governing Board of the 





school: my personal friend Wallace 
Battle; later on Captain Stovall; the 
Episcopal Bishop of Mississippi; 
Moorfield Storey and the present Rec- 
tor of Trinity Church, Boston. Copies 
of this correspondence will show my 
friendly attitude toward these gentle- 
men, and that I simply tried all last 
winter to get a circumstantial account 
of how Baskin came by his death. Be- 
lieving that the younger Anderson was 
likely to shoot anyone white or black 
person who tried to get evidence 
against him, by which he could be tried 
for violent acts in this and in other 
cases, I busied myself with plans to 
get him to consent to have his only 
boys educated in a Presbyterian Ten- 
nessee Mountain School, called Wash- 
ington University, the Principal of 
which I heard deliver a lecture on the 
topic of his school in the Albert Barnes 
Memorial Building of the Old First 
Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia. | 
have worshipped in it since my college 
days in 1876. 

I believe Anderson, who shot Bas- 
kin is an insane man. I think com- 
paratively little good comes of hang- 
ing or electrocuting such persons. | 
certainly think he should be put under 
restraint if not capitally punished. His 
children should be educated outside of 
the state in which Baskin suffered a 
species of martyrdom. I owe a per- 
sonal debt of gratitude to Wallace 
Battle for a favor conferred on a mem- 
ber of my spiritual family which I 
never can repay. 

Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Hersert WELSH. 


THE HARMON AWARDS 

HE Harmon Awards are taking 

their place as thoughtful and ef- 
ficient incentives to accomplishment 
among American Negroes. When they 
were first announced it seemed doubt- 
ful if the machinery and hard work 
would be available to search the widely 
scattered colored group for new and 
worthy material. Dr. George E. 
Haynes has accomplished this task and 
no one who has not tried it realizes its 
difficulty. The judges have repre- 
sented a high order of ability and have 
done their task with disorimination. 
There has been no attempt to do 
merely the popular and logical thing, 
but rather new talent has been dis- 
covered on the one hand and well- 
established reputations have not barred 
men from further recognitions. The 
art exhibit this year at International 
House alone marks an era.

The Flood, the Red Cross, etc. 
(From page +3) Those who could 


get the means went further, to St, 
Louis, Chicago and Detroit. Planta. 
tion owners grew alarmed and made 
severe threats. It became necessary to 
slip out by night. Guards were put 
on the plantation roads. Some fami- 
lies were caught on their way off from 
the plantations and were told that their 
property, household goods, stock, etc., 
belonged to the planter for debt, 
When they protested the property was 
taken and they were told that they 
could go, they were no longer wanted 
there. In spite of all the measures 
taken to prevent it the migration con- 
tinued. W. A. Clements, a lawyer in 
Rolling Fork said that at that time, 
early in October, more than 60 per 
cent. of the Negroes of Sharkey, Issa- 
queena and Warren Counties had left 
and they were still going.

nessee (18-0). Ward (end) and Men- 
denhall (end and back) starred in 
every game for Wilberforce. Wilber- 
force felt the loss of Ritchie (1927 
captain). 

West Virginia \ost only to Blue- 
field, defeated Howard, Lincoln (20- 
6), and Morristown (77-0), and tied 
Wilberforce and Morgan (0-0). 
McConnell (back), Branch (back),

for their school.

N the Southeastern Conference, At- 

lanta, Clark, Alabama State, More-

Brown and Clark. They were vic- 
torious over Talladega (13-7), More-

The Atlanta backfield, made up of

THE Crisis 














Fe 


“We Are Glad to Report”, 


—In the Language of George F. Babbitt, 


66 USINESS has been good with us during 1927.” Maybe we wouldn’t report 
anything else. But one item has more significance than you may realize from 
this statement. That is, Colored People are departing from the old idea of 

life insurance as a funeral benefit. 


Our VICTORY A-A SPECIAL was prepared in March, 1927, to be issued only it 
larger amounts, with $2,500.00 as the minimum, for a limited number of Select Risks. 
As announced in THE CRISIS, maximum benefits, including total and permanent dis- 
ability income and a waiver of premium, with double indemnity for accidental death, 
could be included because of a more careful selection of the risks, and the reduced ex- 
penses involved in the larger amounts of insurance. 


Between the 28th of March and the 31st of December, 1927, Colored People paid for 
348 of these policies, for a total of $1,106,500.00 of insurance. In the nine months 
since the VICTORY A-A SPECIAL was announced, this one policy has constituted 
a fifth of all our new business. The average policy is about $3,000.00 and more than 
half the people who buy it are between the ages of 27 and 41 years. 


This causes us to say that Colored People are buying Life Insurance for other pur- 
poses than a nominal funeral benefit. 


During 1928 discriminating people will find in the VICTORY A-A SPECIAL. in- 
creased facilities for building up from year to year assured incomes for dependents, 
provisions for the education of children, for the payment of mortgages, protection 
from creditors in the development of business enterprise, and, in general, relief from 
most of the cares and worries about unforeseen circumstances that overshadow a busy 
and productive life-time. 


All our policies have modern provisions with reasonable premium rates. A specimen 
copy of the VICTORY A-A SPECIAL with complete information will be sent you 


upon request.

Calling Cards with your name 


peatedly and on extensive tours. In 
North Carolina an unprecedented re- 
ception was given the Secretary of the 
Association. For the first time, per- 
haps, in the history of that state, or of 
any Southern state, a colored man con- 
ducted classes at a white university; 
and his glasses and lectures were 
crowded both with students and pro- 
fessors, to whom the occasion was a 
revelation which must have a profound 
effect upon race relations in that most 
progressive of the Southern states. 


This occurred in the self-same year 
in which THE Crisis was publishing 
its analysis of public school accommo- 
dation for colored children in the 
southern states, financed by the Gar- 
land Fund and conducted by Dr. Du 
Bois, showing the grave discrepancy 
between the expenditures on white and 
colored pupils. 

The N. A. A. C. P. was active too 
in the Mississippi flood district, inves- 
tigating the peonage conditions brought 
to light in the flooded areas, promptly 
reporting to the authorities cases of 
discrimination in the administration of 
flood relief; and in response to re- 
peated requests from outside parties, 
the New Orleans branch consented to 
serve as a distributing agency for gifts 
intended for colored flood sufferers. 


Articles 


HE fight of the N. A. A. C. P. 

is not only one of direct aggres- 
sion upon injustice and discrimination. 
It is constantly pleading its case and 
the Negro’s before the court of the 
world’s public opinion. During the 
year 1927, its pleading has been excep- 
tionally effective. Two members of 
the National Staff collaborated on a 
pamphlet setting forth the African cul- 
tural backgrounds of the Negro, prov- 
ing that he had left behind him in 
Africa and brought with him to Amer- 
ica a considerable heritage of achieve- 
ment. This pamphlet, published by 
the Slater fund, found its way into 
many public libraries. It received 
commendatory editorial comment by 
the New York Times, whose editorial 
was republished in many newspapers 
of the South. Furthermore members 
of the national staff of the Association 
have contributed during the year to 
such leading magazines as the Century 
Magazine, the Forum and Current 
History Magazine, in all of them, as 
well as in the books published by mem- 
bers of the Association, setting forth 
the Negro’s case. 


It is a case increasingly carried not 


address, phone and any fraternal only before the American people but 
emblem, all Free with 6 months before the entire civilized world.

Johnson places: lynching; laws sepa- 
rating the races on railroad cars and 
in the schools; laws excluding the Ne- 
gro from jury service and from the 
Southern primaries; the limitation of 
his privileges in the North which has 
been stimulated by the migration after 
the World War; and the policy of 
the government in Haiti and the Vir- 
gin Islands. Mr. Johnson mentions 
under credit the various inter-racial 
discussion groups which have been 
formed at the different Northern uni- 
versities; the rebuke the Gary school 
strikers received recently; and the new 
self-consciousness of Negroes which is 
causing them to view themselves cri-
