INSURANCE PREMIUM 


KEY TO 
«72s ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE 


Did you ever think, when paying your weekly premium to your 
Southern Aid Agent, what an immense amount of good that premium 
does? Well, follow it through. 


That premium gives you a set sum weekly when you are disabled 
by sickness or accident; or, in case of death, a sum to provide a decent 
burial or a nest egg for a loved one. As worry about such things takes all 
the joy out of life, that premium makes life more enjoyable and secure. 


The above protective features of that premium are only a part of the 
good that it does. That premium also helps to provide employment for 
the agent who collects it, as well as the officers and clerks in charge of 
the business. That premium goes into banks with thousands of others 
and thus swells the funds that are loaned to responsible people to buy 
homes, to conduct business or professions, or to educate children. Thus 
that premium protects you, and also benefits the doctor, nurse, land- 
lord, groceryman, clothier, banker, and even the undertaker. 


Now, the question is: Are you placing as many of those premiums as 
possible where they will do the most good for you and your people?

SIS 


VER since the “measurement 

of minds” became a popular field 

in which to pursue investiga- 
tions, the testing of Negro children has 
easily ranked as a major indoor sport 
among psychologists. The rules of the 
game are simple and seem to be stand- 
ardized throughout the country with 
but few exceptions. First one must 
have a white examiner; a group of 
Negro children; a test standardized for 
white children tested by white exam- 
iners; and just a few pre-conceived no- 
tions regarding the nature of “‘intelli- 
gence”, the degree with which Negro 
children are endowed, if at all, with 
this faculty and the fact that the social 
status of Negro children need not be 
considered as an extra allowance for 
scores different from whites. The per- 
sons who have constructed this game of 
intellectual calibration have already de- 
cided that those white children who 
make low scores do so because they 
were born that way; and, conversely, 
if a child from a good home makes a 
better score than the child from a 
poorer home, as is usally the case, the 
point is proved. For, they reasoned 
with absolute logical accuracy (once 
the little matter of the major premise 
is granted), the white family has a 
high social status because it has a high 
intelligence. Why does it have a high 
intelligence? Because it has a high 
social status. Q. E. D. 

Of course, when examining white 
children, the examiner must be very 
careful to establish rapport with his 
subject. He must take care that an 
esprit cordiale exists between himself 
and the person being given the test. 
If this is not done, so long as white 
children are being tested, the results of 
the game may not be valid. But for 
some reason, perhaps the docility of the 
Negro subjects, or the innate superior- 
ity of the race to which the examiner 
belongs, this caution is not to be re- 
garded in testing Negro children. Then 
again, the Negro children are of cruder 
clay, perhaps; why respect the sensi- 
bilities, the delicate susceptibility, of 
black boys and girls? It is to laugh— 
to dare a supposition that the same fine 
technique used in gaining sympathetic 
accord with the white child needs to be 
used with Negro children! 

‘ 


HE rules of the game, then, are 
absolutely fair. It will be ob- 
served that, since we have already dis- 
counted the influence of social status

way and though we had a sneaking sus-

dices with a vast array of statistical 
tables, bewildering vistas of curves and

who once on a time held that: “

fails to take into consideration the 
differences existent in social status, 
can be considered valid”. Another was

Garth of the University of Texas. He 
is at least frank enough to state that 
he believes the Negro is inferior, but 
the confounded fellow persists in say- 
ing that environmental differences will 
have to be equalized before a scientific 
conclusion to this effect is made. His 
data were collected under the rules of 
the game, it is true; they certainly re- 
vealed as definite differences as other 
studies. 

Perhaps the most classic example of 
the conventional method of playing the 
game is that furnished by Brigham’s 
“Study of American Intelligence”. 
This vigorous young Princeton psy- 
chologist clearly demonstrated that the 
Negro draftees were of the average in- 
telligence of a 9 year old child. It is 
true that the whites were only as in- 
telligent as a 12 year old child and 
one might well believe that the younger 
generation was far and away in ad- 
vance of the older; or else, that the 
Four Million who marched away to 
save the world for Democracy were 
morons and degenerate idiots. If the 
average intelligence of the adult men 
of America is equivalent to that of a 
12 year old child, the coming genera- 
tion will be made up of super-men, as 
we know men today. Shades of 
Nietszche! 


UT the main point in Mr. Brig- 
ham’s treatise was, as we have 
said, the demonstrated fact that Ne- 
groes were very inferior. He played 
the game so thoroughly that Dear Old 
Nassau should well be proud of this 
young sportsman. What did it matter 
that another study disclosed the fact 
that those states with the poorest school 
systems produced the most child-like 
minds? Did not Brigham immediately 
retort that even when soldiers of the 
two races were compared where they 
had the same vears of schooling, the 


258 


Negroes were poorer? Did he not 
show that invariably a Negro with a 
seventh grade education in Georgia 





Vera Turner, I. Q. 132 


would make a lower score than the 
white soldier with a seventh grade edu- 
cation from Massachusetts ? 


Giving intelligence tests in the College of Education, Oklahoma A. and N. University, 
Langston, Oklahoma 


We might indicate another rule of 
the game evidenced by Brigham’s re- 
port. The Army Tests gave the dis- 
tressing information that Northern Ne- 
groes were far superior to the Southern 
whites! Was this due to the fact that 
they had better schooling? By no 
means. It must never be forgotten 
when such a result appears, that the 
Negroes who are superior to any group 
of whites are “‘exceptions”’; and, to tell 
the truth, any of them possessing in- 
telligence have white blood in them. 
As all Negroes who have achieved any- 
thing have white blood in their veins 
and furthermore, as that infallible de- 
cennial, The United States Census, 
tells us that only 25% of Negroes in 
this country are “mulattoes”, whatever 
that means, this is proof positive of 
what just a little strain of white blood 
will do for the salvation of the dumb 
Negro blood. Perhaps, after all, as 
the ancients believed, there is something 
to the localization of intelligence in the 
“humours” of the blood. 


HE writer of the present article 

was much impressed with the fair- 
ness and efficiency of this game, for we 
are so dreadfully efficient in this coun- 
try that even our sports must have that 
semblance. So he decided to try to play 
it. Of course, he broke one of the 
rules in the beginning, for he believed 
that, as white investigators are able to 
gain fullest rapport with white chil- 
dren, the same thing might be true of 
Negro testers with Negro children. 
Also, instead of discounting environ- 
ment to begin with, he kept it in mind 
as a possible factor. The other rules 
of the game, including the testing tech- 
nique, the statistical technique, et al.. 
he regarded with the most scrupulous 
attention, fearing that any other pro- 
cedure would lay the study open to the 
damning indictment of “unreliable be- 
cause the testing technique was inac- 
curate”. The writer, accordingly, 
played the game as he had been taught 
to play it in two of the leading psych- 
ological laboratories of the country. He 
sometime “leaned over backward’, in 
fact, in order to maintain “scientific” 
accuracy. 















































THe Crisis 

















The children tested were unselected 
—no doubt one of the writer’s white 
confreres would have classified them as 
exceptional for Negroes from the 
start, because the group included chil- 
dren from professional homes, middle- 
class homes and laboring homes, in- 
stead of the Negro children from lab- 
orer-class homes altogether with whom 
the game is usually played in the ap- 
proved fashion. The results were so 
striking that the investigator was 


to be “subnormal” in: intelligence, 
down to the moron, imbecile and idiot 
classes; to make a score above this 
standard of 100 (which is known as 
I. Q., or intelligence quotient) is to be 
“superior”, up through the exceptional, 
near-genius and genius categories. The 
higher I. Q., the more intelligent the 
subject is supposed to be. Most white 
psychologists report the average I. Q. 
of Negro children as falling about 85, 
placing the race on the border-line be- 


dren (to use Terman’s data again) 
reach or exceed this mark. Of our 
group, no less than 26% exceeded a 
score of 130! 

The most fortunate part of the whole 
study is that these children have not yet 
achieved prominence and accordingly, 
have not yet been classified as Mulat- 
toes. One little girl made a score of 
142. Neither the child nor her par- 
entage evidences any admixture of 


white blood. Of the five children with

forced to the immediate conclusion that 
no Negro psychologist should play this 
game, as his data will “gum up the 
works”. If the data here presented is 
in any way typical—and there is no 
reason to believe that it is not—it be- 
comes at once evident that the game 
was made for white psychologists to 
play with Negro children and for this 
to be changed means that the game is 
bound to end in a different way than 
is customary. ‘ 

The test used was the original Binet- 
Simon, in the revised form produced 
by Professor Lewis Terman of Leland 
Stanford University. Intelligence is 
rated on a scale with 100 as approxi- 
mate normality. To fall far below is

tween extreme dullness and the moron 
class. 


F the thirty children tested, 63% 

made scores (I. Q.’s) above 106. 
According to Mr. Terman, only 33% 
of white children may be expected to 
make such a score. Mr. Terman states 
that only 5% of white children may be 
expected to equal or exceed an I. Q. of 
122; no less than 47% of our subjects 
exceeded this score. Only 3% of white 
children may be expected to possess 
I: Q.’s above 125; 42% of our sub- 
jects exceeded this tota!. 

Perhaps the most striking contrast 
is to be found in the group scoring 
above 130 I. Q. This is an extremely 
rare group, as only 1% of white chil- 


the highest scores, not one was any 
lighter in complexion than the brown 
races of Africa of which modern 
Ethnology is now telling us. 


So we hold that our group was com- 
posed of “exceptional” Negro children. 
The same sort of a group could be 
selected in any Negro community, how- 
ever. If it be objected that the group 
was too small for extensive generali- 
zations, we admit the fact gladly. If 
it be objected that our children come 
from homes on the whole superior to 
the “typical” Negro home, we would 
demur politely and even yield that 
point for the sake of continued discus- 
sion. The fact is that many excep- 
tional children (Turn to page 278)

Child Literature and Negro Childhood 


NDERSEN’S Leap Frog built 
A tor childhood from the breast 

bone of a goose was in time to 
delight George Brandes. Strange how 
attractive to adults are the whimseys 
that gratify childhood! Was Eugene 
Field consistent in depicting the child 
heart as such an elusive little organism, 
a “mouse”, a little something quite 
apart from “big hearts”? I read this 
in a review of the new Alice in Won- 
derland (Appleton), “An admirable 
gift for a boy or girl of years from 
6 to 9”. 

There are children’s books that ap- 
peal to all ages. There are children’s 
books that like lollipops are respectors 
of no epoch. Had Antonio Beltramel- 
li’s Piccolo Pomi (New York: Doran) 
been liberated by post chaise instead 
of by auto from Aunt Andromache 
it would have been equally gratifying. 
Just so the emancipation took place 
for that luckless Italian orphan, Pomi, 
as wistfully docile according to au- 
thor and illustrator as a Corregio 
cherub and so hideously imposed upon 
by cruel Aunt Andromache that one 
from the outset hovers beside the child 
to travel with him through all sorts 
of exotic settings—into rural Italy 
where one meets scng sparrows and 
larks—into robbers’ dens and finally 
to fortune. 


HILDHOOD would close this 

book with a sigh of relief because 
of Pomi’s deliverance. You and I 
might end with thinking, “and so they 
have song sparrows and larks and 
acorns in Italy too”. This very dif- 
fering viewpoint between children 27d 
adults causes one to doubt their at- 
taching a common importance to the 
appearance of Tim and Molly in Inez 
Hayes Irwin’s Maida’s Little Shop 
(Viking Press). The whole joy of 
the store keeping project of a little 
girl who had at first been a cripple and 
thus cut off from other children in 
their play would absorb the child read- 
ers. They would like to watch girl 
and boy patrons coming one by one 
to Maida’s. 

But you and I might be specifically 
happy in meeting Tim and Molly be- 
cause they are respectively “a round 
brown pop-eyed big-mouthed little 
creature” and a “round brown little 
creature too—but pretty”. They are 
lively figures in the story. I have 
hopefully searched among so many 
child books for a glimpse of colored 
children. Here is one by a New Mexi- 
can Indian about Indians. Here is

RECALL the books that formed the 

fantasy realm of my _ childhood. 
There were the fair curls of Faunt- 
leroy, Nibelungen plaits of sheen. 
There was the “lily maid of Astolat” 
and there was blond Rowena—for I 
did not then realize that Rebecca is 
really heroine of Ivanhoe. Compared 
with these I had Miss Schwartz sim- 
ply adding avoirdupois to Vanity Fair. 
A pity, considering how prone is child- 
hood to idealize, to behold in an um- 
brella a parachute, in a derby a hop- 
lite’s helmet. 

My childhood’s fairy books depicted 
Cinderella as flaxen haired and blue 
eyed and there was nothing in the 
world to suggest her oriental origin, 
her initial appearance in the sumptuous 
nursery of a son of the Pharaohs. The 
first volume of Drinkwater’s Outlines 
of Literature might have enriched my 
outlook upon life, had the work ap- 
peared then instead of forty-eight 
months ago. It might have added price- 
less significance to much of my early 
reading. I could have learned that 
with some variations the dainty myth 
of Diana and Endymion has for ages 
been known to certain African tribes 
and that Zulus have their version of 
the Cupid-Psyche story. 


MIGHT have learned that the first 

booksellers were Egyptian under- 
takers. Then I cculd also have dis- 
covered something of the precepts of 
Ptah Hotep dating from 2500 years 
before Homer’s writings. Instead of 
learning Miss Carey’s “There is noth- 
ing so kingly as kindness”, I should 
perhaps have learned this from the 
“Precepts”: “Live therefore in the 
house of kindliness and men shall come 
and give gifts of themselves’. 

Mentioning Cinderella above 
brought to my mind something rela- 
tive to the new library for white people 
in this Southern city in which I live. 
According to press reports marvelous 
murals color the children’s room with 
fairy lore. Indeed a print in one of 
the Sunday papers presented their 
Cinderella as the traditional blond. 
That reminds me. Seumas MacManus 
in his Donegal Wonder Book (New 
York: Frederick A. Stokes) revives the 
little Pharaoh’s story under the title 
of Black Sheep. If I may go back to 
murals in the new library here, there 
really seems to be (Turn to page 280) 


THE Crisis 














AY 20, 1925, was commence- 
M ment day at Okolona Insti- 

tute. This is a colored school, 
supported by the Episcopal Church, 
in northeastern Mississippi, in and near 
a small Mississippi town of four thou- 
sand inhabitants. The plant is valued 
at about a quarter of a million dollars 
and the school has been established 
twenty-five years. The Governor of 
the state, H. L. Whitfield, was ex- 
pected to speak on this occasion. The 
Episcopal Bishop of Mississippi was 
to be present and many white and col- 
ored notables. 

Early in the morning, Ulysses S. 
Baskin, a graduate of the school and 
of Tuskegee, a world war veteran 
and for seven years superintendent of 
mechanical industries, was milking in 
the pasture ten rods from his home. 
He saw a white man looking about 
the pasture, who quickly disappeared. 
After he had turned his cow back to 
the pasture and started home, two 
white men, H. Anderson and his son, 
came from behind the trees and told 
him to stop. They asked if he knew 
anything about the killing of their dog. 
Mr. Baskin replied that a week before, 
three dogs had gotten into the pasture 
and killed a goat. He had shot at the 
dogs and killed one. The men said 
that they did not want an explanation ; 
that they wanted to know if he killed 
the dog. Baskin repeated his story 
saying he did not know whose dogs 
they were, but if they were theirs he 
was ready to adjust the matter to their 
satisfaction. Immediately the two men 
shot him eight times, on the side of 
the head and in Baskin’s left thigh. 
All this was plainly seen by two col- 
ored men, by Baskin’s wife and by sev- 
eral visitors and teachers at the super- 
intendent’s house. The superintendent 
lived two days after he was shot and 
then died leaving a widow, three chil- 
dren and a fourth born after his death. 
The Andersons took the pistol which 
they found on him with them and went 
home. 


HERE seems to be no dispute 

about the above facts. They have 
been well known to the authorities of 
the Episcopal Church and to the trus- 
tees of the school. The story of the 
conversation is from Baskin’s ante- 
mortem statement. Of his death from 
the gun shot wounds by the Ander- 
sons there is no question. 


Wallace Battle, founder and prin- 
cipal of the school; demanded the ar- 
rest of the Andersons. The Grand

Jury was about to adjourn, but was 
held over for a day and the Andersons 
were arraigned before it. Not a single 
witness appeared against them. The 
only witnesses at the trial were the 
Andersons themselves. Their story 
was that when they asked Baskin about 
their dog, he drew a revolver and shot 
at them twice and that they killed him 
in self-defense. They had handed Bas-

kin’s revolver with two cartridges ex- 
ploded to the chief of police after the 
murder. They were freed and have 
not been arrested since. 

ALLACE BATTLE has at 

various times and in various 
places declared that the above facts 
are by no means the whole of the 
story; that the Andersons had a bad 
reputation and had been in shooting 
scrapes before and had at least one 
other murder to their credit ; that there 
were witnesses to the murder of Bas- 
kin, colored and white, but that the 
mob spirit was such in the town, and 
the feeling against a school for Ne- 
groes so strong, that these witnesses 
dare not testify; that the shooting was 
a merciless assassination for which no 
possible excuse could be given; that 
after the elder Anderson had shot this 
teacher to death he took from Baskin’s 
pocket a revolver from which no shells 
had been fired, carried it into the An- 
derson’s garden and within the sight 
of a white lady, fired two shots so as 
to make it appear that their story of 
self-defense was creditable. 

Mr. Battle declares that for some 
time he had seen the mob spirit form- 
ing in Okolona. He believes that 
séventy-five per cent of the white 
people of the town and vicinity are his 
firm friends. Many white people say 
that Battle was the best loved Negro 
in Mississippi. White Mississippians 
have given money to the school; have 
acted upon the Board of Trustees; and 
have on many occasions, protected the 
institution. 

But these friends find themselves 
helpless apparently before the other 
twentv-five per cent, consisting of some 
poor, illiterate whites, some rich men, 
some preachers and politicians who 
were determined the school should go. 
Mr. Battle declares that twice recently 
his own life has been threatened and 
that once he strongly suspected an ef- 
fort to burn down the school. With 
his wife and family he was once way- 
layed in August, 1924, by an automo- 
bile full of white men who went by 
him at great speed and then blocked 
his road. He escaped by backing his 
car and fleeing to his campus at the 
rate of fifty miles an hour. Two weeks 
later, on a public street opposite the 
post office, this same H. Anderson 
stopped Battle and threatened to kill 
him if he approached the mayor about 
the case of a Negro whom Anderson 
had nearly beaten to death. Battle 
offered to prove that he had said noth- 
ing to the mayor about the matter by 


261 


going with Anderson to the mayor. 
He afterward tried to get the trustees 
to take up the matter, but they thought 
it best to let it die down. 

In March, white Mississippi ladies 
planted two magnolias on the high- 
way in front of the campus. In May 
these magnolias were pulled down and 
one of the gate posts of the campus in- 
jured. On Tuesday night, May 19, 
just before commencement the water 
supply of the school was cut off. Then 
came the tragedy of commencement 
day. 

Wallace Battle, the principal of the 
school, declared that if these murder- 
ers were to go unpunished or if at 
least they were not compelled to leave 
town, he could not continue to remain 
as head of Okolona Institute. 


O realize just what this statement 

meant, one must know something 
of Wallace Battle. To American Ne- 
groes, Battle represents the extreme 
type of the so-called “white folk’s nig- 
ger’; but he was undoubtedly sincere 
about it. He believed in Southern 
white people; he believed that their 
hearts were in the right place; he be- 
lieved that if a Negro tried hard and 
did his duty he had nothing to fear 
from the Southern mob; or if he was 
threatened with mob violence and had 
the right sort of reputation and 
friends that the good white people 
would come to his defense. Battle 
thought that he had proven his thesis 
by establishing and maintaining the 
school at Okolona. There was bitter 
opposition at first against such a Negro 
school, but it had been overcome and 
few colored men stood so high in any 
Southern community as Wallace Bat- 
tle. He was a clean, honest, sincere 
man, but Negroes considered him lack- 
ing in backbone and _ self-assertion. 
They accused him of going out of his 
way to condemn black men who stood 
up for manhood rights and to excuse 
the South on every occasion. Battle 
was one of those who criticized the 
Booker Washington luncheon at the 
White House and recently condemned 
Tuskegee for her determination to 
maintain the great Government hos- 
pital with black employees. Battle 
certainly served the white people well 
and in turn they helped him. 

To Battle this sudden and wanton 
murder of his friend and employee 
came as a terrible blow. He demanded 
justice and confidently expected it. He 
expected the best elements of the white 
community and the whole church to 
stand back of the demand that these 
murderers be arrested and punished. 
When this seemed improbable he de- 
manded that at least public op‘nion 
should compel their withdrawal frem 
the community and when slowly it be- 
gan to dawn upon him that nothing 


262 


was going to be done, he declared that 
if this were the case he could no longer 
serve as principal of Okolona. 


N the meantime, it looked as though 

the church was up in arms about 
this outrage. Prominent officials con- 
sidered this murder as not simply the 
killing of an individual, but as a wan- 
ton affront to the Episcopal Church, 
to education and to civilization in Mis- 
sissippi. They determined to demand 
redress. If it was impossible to secure 
the legal punishment of the Andersons 
it was proposed that the church make 
an open and clear appeal to the civil- 
ized world. They determined to ask 
the white president of the Board of 
Trustees, Captain A. T. Stovall of 
Okolona, to arrange for a mass meet- 
ing of the citizens of Okolona so that 
representatives of the church and of 


The Murdered Man and his Family. 
A fourth child was born after his death 


the school could lay the matter frankly 
before them and ask them to take ac- 


tion. Beyond this, they proposed to 
appeal to the whole church. It hap- 
pened that the General Convention of 
the Episcopal Church was to be held 
in New Orleans in the fall of 1925. 
The argument for bringing the con- 
vention to New Orleans was that the 
North and West would thus be able 
to learn more of the South. Wallace 
Battle was on the program to speak of 
educational efforts among Negroes. It 
was proposed that Mr. Battle tell the 
church and the world the story of the 
murder of Baskin by the Andersons 
and of the failure of the state of Mis- 
sissippi to punish the murderers. 


URTHER than this, friends of 

Okolona and of the National As- 
sociation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People appealed to the Associa- 
tion to take ‘egal steps. One distin- 
guished citizen of Philadelphia wrote: 
“In my judgment the only way to 
stop such horrible outrages . . . is by 


sending a resolute and trained man or 
woman to the spot getting the evi- 
dence and then trying to secure con- 
victions, to be followed by the inflic- 
tion of extreme penalty of the law. 
We could not have better cases to work 
upen. If you take up these cases. with 
the same vigor and discretion that you 
showed in other like cases you will 
probably put a stop forever to such 
lynchings. I have, unfortunately, no 
mney to spare, but I will help you 
in any other way I can. I think you 
and your organization are doing a 
splendid and much needed work. I 
would not for a moment consider that 
time-serving X of the Oko- 
lona School. I have letters from Su- 
perintendent Battle that will start you 
finely in your God-given work at any 
rate.” 

Our legal committee began to look 
into the matter when suddenly they 
received another letter from Philadel- 
phia saying that: “It is urged that 
any airing of such a matter would im- 
mediately bring down upon the colored 
people who run this school the wrath 
of the surrounding white neighbors. 
When I wrote to Mr. Battle asking 
him why he had not fulfilled his prom- 
ise I learned from him that his Board 
of Trustees had refused to allow him 
to say anything in the matter.” 


EANTIME, what had §hap- 

pened? The officers of the 
Church Institute had set forth their 
plan of protest and publicity. The 
Bishop of. Mississippi and the Presid- 
ing Bishop of the Church had con- 
sented to it. Many others had ex- 
pressed strong sympathy, but Captain 
Stovall of Okolona had strongly dis- 
agreed. He refused to call the local 
meeting but arranged for a meeting 
at Memphis where the Bishop of Mis- 
sissippi, Mr. Bolton Smith, Mr. Wal- 
lace Battle and others were present. 
Captain Stovall insisted that this was 
not a clear case of race hatred or of 
enmity to the school; that Baskin was 
armed ; that no witnesses had appeared 
against the murderers. He persuaded 
the members of the Council that it was 
a sign of guilt for a black man in Mis- 
sissippi, protecting his flocks from dogs 
and himself from something worse, to 
carry a pistol. He persuaded them to 
assume that the absence of witnesses 
was not a proof of any mob spirit in 
Okolona, but simply because there 
really were no witnesses; and he told 
Wallace Battle that he believed Bat- 
tle’s mind to be a little unhinged by 
the sad event and advised him to take 
a vacation. 

With such pressure put upon him, 
Battle backed down, shut his mouth 
and went off on a vacation. He spoke 
later at the church Convention but said 
nothing about the (Turn to page 282)

HE first Pan-African Congress 

was held February 19-21, 1919, 
in the Grand Hotel, Paris. The ex- 
ecutive committee consisted of M. 
Blaise Diagne, President; Dr. W. E. 
B. Du Bois, Secretary; Mrs. Ida Gibbs 
Hunt and Mr. M. E. F. Fredericks. 
Fifty-seven delegates representing fif- 
teen countries were present and among 
the speakers were members of the 
French Parliament, the President of 
Liberia, a former Secretary of State of 
Portugal and several other dis- 
tinguished persons. 

The second Pan-African Congress 
met in London August 28 and 29, 
1921, in Brussels, Belgium, August 31, 
and September 1 and 2, 1921, and in 
Paris, France, September 4 and 5, 
1921, with M. Blaise Diagne as Presi- 
dent and W. E.-B. Du Bois as Execu- 
tive Secretary. A special committee 
visited the Assembly of the League of 
Nations with a petition, September 6. 
There were present one hundred and 
ten delegates representing thirty-three 
different countries and the sessions 
were attended by about a thousand visi- 
tors. Among the speakers were Flor- 
ence Kelley of America, Norman Leys 
of England, Senator LaFontaine and 
Professor Otlet of Belgium, Blaise 
Diagne and M. Barthélemy of the 
French Chamber of Deputies, General 
Sorelas of Spain, M. Paul Panda of the 
Belgian Congo and others. The Euro- 
pean press of England, Scotland, 
France, Belgium, Germany and Italy 
took wide notice of the Congress. 


HE third Pan-African Congress 

was held November 7 and 8, 
1923, in London and November 25, 
1923 in Lisbon. There was a small 
number of delegates to these sessions 
as the Congress had not been properly 
worked up by the Fren@l. secretary. 
The Circle of Peace and Foreign Re- 
lations under Mrs. A. W. Hunton as 
Chairman finally sent Dr. Du Bois to 
hold the Congress. There were some 
distinguished people as speakers includ- 
ing Sir Sidney, now Lord Olivier, Mr. 
H. G. Wells and Mr. Harold Lasky; 
and Mr. Ramsey McDonald: would 
have been present had it not been for 
the sudden crisis of the general elec- 
tion. In Lisbon there were present 
the Minister of Colonies and one for- 
mer minister and several members of 
parliament. 

It was planned to have the fourth 
Pan-African Congress meet. in the 
West Indies in 1925 but the plans mis- 
carried on account of the difficulty of 
transport. Finally, the Circle of Peace 
and Foreign Relations, under the

Three Thousand Dollars to finance 
the Congress and made all the arrange- 
ments. Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois acted 
as General Chairman and Mr. Ray- 
ford W. Logan as Secretary and in- 
terpreter. An exhibition of fifty-two 
maps and charts illustrating the con- 
dition of peoples of African descent 
was arranged by Dr. Du Bois and was 
on exhibition at headquarters.

HE program included an opening 

meeting with history of the Pan- 
African Congresses and greetings by 
delegates from West Africa, several 
of the West Indian Islands, ‘including 
Haiti, and the East Indies. To this 
Mr. William Pickens added a report 
of the Brussels Conference for Op- 
pressed Races. On the following three 
days, sessions were held morning, after- 
noon and night, taking up African mis- 
sions, the history of Africa, the history 
and present conditions of the West 
Indies, the economic development of 
Africa and the political partition of 
Africa. The closing meeting — dealt 
with education in Africa and African 
art and literature. 

Among the chief speakers during 
the sessions were M. Dantes Belle- 
garde, former Minister of Haiti to 
France, former Member of the As- 
sembly of the League of Nations and 
Commander of the French Legion of 
Honor; Dr. Charles H. Wesley, of 
Howard University; Professor Mel- 
ville Herskovits of Columbia; Profes- 
sor L. W. Hansberry of Howard; 
Chief Amoah III of the British Gold 
Coast; Mr. Leslie Pinkney Hill and 
Mr. H. H. Phillips of Cheyney; Dr. 
Wilhelm Mensching of Germany; and 
Mr. John Vandercook. All the ses- 
sions were well attended and the even- 
ing sessions often crowded. The total 


- attendance ‘aggregated five thousand 


persons. ‘There were 208 paid dele- 
gates, representing 22 states and the 
District of Columbia; Haiti, the Vir- 
gin Islands, the Bahamas and Barba- 
does; South America; the Gold Coast, 
Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Liberia, 
West Africa; Germany and India. The

the legitimate aims and needs of the 
peoples of Negro descent. 


representatives from 


In General 


Negroes everywhere need: 

1. A voice in their own govern- 
ment. 

2. Native rights to the land and 
its natural resources. 

3. Modern education for all chil- 
dren. 

4. The development of Africa for 
the Africans and not merely for the 
profit of Europeans. 

5. The re-organization of com- 
merce and industry so as to make the 
main object of capital and labor the 
welfare of the many rather than the 
enriching of the few. 

6. The treatment of civilized men 
as civilized despite differences of birth, 
race or color. 

Specifically and in particular we 
stress the need of reform in the fol- 
lowing countries: 


Haiti 

N accordance with the report of the 

Committee of Six disinterested 
Americans we demand: the withdrawal 
from Haiti of all military forces of the 
United States and all officers, military, 
naval or otherwise, except only regu- 
larly accredited diplomatic representa- 
tives or consular agents. We demand 
that actual self-government be restored. 
In 1928 Haitian elections should be 
held. We demand that the American 
Receiver General of Customs be re- 
placed by equitable agreement with 
the bond holders and that in general 
the attempt of American capital to 
dominate the industry and monopolize 
the land of Haiti be decisively checked 
and turned into such channels as will 
encourage industry and agriculture for 
the benefit of Haitian people. 


Africa. 

HE attitude of all the imperial 

powers who own Africa is funda- 
mentally wrong. They are seeking 
profit, not men; they want trade and 
industry more than civilization and 
spiritual uplift. This attitude is:a 
menace, not simply to Africans, but to 
modern democratic culture. It must 
and will be changed. 


British Africa 
E congratulate Great Britain on 
granting increased political 
power to the four colonies of British 


263 


West Africa. We urge an extension 
of this policy so that Africans may con- 
trol their own legislative councils. 

We urge the restoration of their 
land and the granting of a voice in the 
government to the natives of Kenya 
and of Northern and Southern 
Rhodesia. 

We are alarmed at the attempt of 
the white minority in the Union of 
South Africa to monopolize the land 
of the black’ Aboriginees; to exclude 
them from profitable labor; to main- 
tain, in effect, their present disfran- 
chisement and to reduce them to im- 
potent serfdom. We regard the re- 
actionary program of the Herzog gov- 
ernment as the greatest challenge to 
decent race relations in our day. 

In all British Africa it is lamentable 
to note how little is being done to edu- 
cate the natives despite the founding 
of Achimota College. 


French Africa 

E urge in French Africa a fur- 

ther development of their ad- 
mirable scheme of native education and 
an extension of political rights for a 
larger number of natives. We ask pro- 
tection for the natives against the ex- 
ploitation by French industry and com- 
merce of the resources of this great 
colony. 


The Belgian Congo 


E still await in the Belgium 

Congo real evidence of a move- 
ment on the part of Belgium to re- 
store land ownership to the natives; 
to give them some voice in their own 
government and to restrain the effort 
to make the Belgium Congo merely a 
profitable investment for European in- 
dustry, with almost no concerted ef- 
fort to uplift and develop the natives 
and conserve the natural resources for 
them. We are glad to see an increase 
in the appropriation for education in 
the Congo, but it is still far below the 
amount needed. 


A byssinia 

E demand the continued inde- 

pendence of Abyssinia, coupled 
with international movements on the 
part of philanthropists to bring modern 
education to the people of that land 
and modern industry planned for the 
benefit of the Abyssinians and not sim- 
ply for the European trade. 


Liberia 

E congratulate Liberia upon her 
improved financial position, but 

we are alarmed at the increasing power 
and influence of the owners of the Fire- 
stone rubber concession. We urge the 
authorities of Liberia and the Negro 
voters in the United States to be vigi- 


264 


lant lest this industry’s concession en- 
croach upon the political independence 
of Liberia. We believe that the solu- 
tion of Liberia’s problems lies in the 
establishment of a strong system of uni- 
versal education for all Liberians of 
both native and American descent. 


Portugal 


E demand for Portugal and her 

African colonies a curbing of 
that financial and industrial power 
which is forcing her into bankruptcy 
and making her colonies the property 
of slave-driving concessionaires, despite 
the liberal and far-sighted colonial leg- 
islation of Portugal. 


Missions 


E believe in missionary effort but 

in missionary effort for health, 
morals and education and not for mili- 
tary aggression and sectarian super- 
stitions. 


The West Indies 


E urge the peoples of the West 

Indies to begin an earnest move- 
ment for the federation of these islands; 
the reduction of their present out- 
rageous expenses of government; the 
broadening of educational facilities on 
modern lines and labor legislation to 
protect the workers against industrial 
exploitation. We regard the first step 


towards this to be an utter erasing of 
that color line between mulattoes and 
blacks, which sprang from slavery and 
is still being drawn and encourzged by 
those who are the enemies of Negro 
freedom. 


United States 


E believe that the Negroes of the 

United States should begin the 
effective use of their political power 
and instead of working for a few minor 
offices or for merely local favors and 
concessions, they should vote with their 
eyes fixed upon the international prob- 
lems of the color line and the national 
problems which effect the Negro race 
in the United States. Only indepen- 
dent votes for candidates who will 
carry out their desires regardless of 
party will bring them political and 
economic freedom. 

The economic situation of American 
Negroes is still precarious. We be- 
lieve that along with their entry into 
industry as skilled and semi-skilled 
workers and their growing ownership 
of land and homes they should espe- 
cially organize as consumers and 
from co-operative effort seek to bring 
to bear upon investors and producers 
the coercive power which co-operative 
consumption has already attained in 
certain parts of Europe and of Amer- 
ica. Lynching, segregation and mob 


violence still oppress and crush black 
America but education and organized 
social and political power begin to 
point the way out. 


Other Peoples 


PON matters that lie outside our 

own problems, we must also ex- 
press our thought and wish because the 
narrow confines of the modern world 
entwine our interests with those of 
other peoples. We desire to see free- 
dom and real national independence in 
Egypt, in China and in India. We de- 
mand the cessation of the interference 
of the United States in the affairs of 
Central and South America. 

We thank the Soviet Government of 
Russia for its liberal attitude toward 
the colored races and for the help which 
it has extended to them from time to 
time. 

We urge the white workers of the 
world to realize that no program of 
labor uplift can be successfully carried 
through in Europe or America so long 
as colored labor is exploited and en- 
slaved and deprived of all political 
power. 

A committee to call a Fifth Pan- 
African Congress and to present to it 
a plan of permanent organization was 
appointed. It consisted of Dr. W. E. 
B. Du Bois, chairman, Mrs. A. W. 
Hunton, M. Dantes Bellegarde, Mr. 
H. H. Phillips, Mr. Rayford W. Lo- 
gan, Mr. F. Eugene Corbie, Mr. Otto 
E. Huiswoud, Mrs. B. Cannady 
and Bishop R. C. Ransom. This com- 
mittee has power to enlarge its num- 
ber.

And place on her a wedding ring of

The pain beneath your wrinkled smile 
That aches incessantly. 


There’s a quiver in your speech, 
Old man, 

I clearly hear 

A trembling in your feeble voice, 
A trembling as from fear.

All fond hopes turned to lies, 
One son in jail— 

Another, dead, 


How could you be elsewise?

Before five hundred people. (It was Sun-

There wasn’t anybody in the old Park,

And let them rest 
Against the anguish 
Of my breast.

You do not understand. 

But we are old 

As the jungle trees 

That bloomed forever; 

Old as the forgotten rivers 

That flowed into the earth. 

Surely we know what you do not know: 
Joy of living, 

Uselessness of things. 

You are too young to understand yet. 
Build another skyscraper 
Touching the stars. 

We sit with our backs against a tree 

And watch skyscrapers tumble 

And stars forget. 

Solomon built a temple 
And it must have fallen down. 
It isn’t here now. 
We know some things, being old, 
You do not understand.

OCCUPIED HAITI 


66 CCUPIED HAITI” is edited 
by Emily Green Balch, “being 
the report of a committee of six dis- 
interested Americans, representing or- 
ganizations exclusively American, who 
having personally studied conditions in 
Haiti, 1926, favor the restoration of 
the independence of the Negro repub- 
lic’. This is the book for which we 
all have long been waiting. The facts 
concerning the American Occupation 
of Haiti have been meager and difficult 
to get at, and while the excellent work 
ot Mr. Ernest Gruening and Mr. J. 
W. Johnsen have thrown a flood of 
light on Haitian conditions, there has 
not been until now a single volume 
which contained the whole story. 

The pilgrimage to Haiti which re- 
sulted in this book was started by the 
Women’s International League for 
Peace and Freedom. The membership 
of the Committee consisted of two 
colored women, Miss Charlotte At- 
wood of the Washington Public 
Schools and Mrs. A. W. Hunton; 
three white women: Miss Zonia Baber, 
former Frofessor in the University 
of Chicago, Miss Balch, a Professor 
in Wellesley College and Mrs. J. H. 
Watson of the Fellowship of Recon- 
ciliation. Paul H. Douglas of the 
University of Chicago was the sole 
male member of the Committee. 

HE report begins with a short his- 

tory of Haiti, followed by a po- 
litical history of the occupation. -It is a 
story of inexcuseable aggression, dis- 
tortion of the truth, cheating and dis- 
crimination. “The excuse which is 
generally given for the American oc- 
cupation of Haiti is that it was neces- 
sary to prevent foreign intervention”. 
This was untrue. German cruisers had 
been swept from the seas, the French 
had absolutely no intention of inter- 
fering, England was too busy and “it 
seems, therefore, that there was vir- 
tually no danger of foreign interven- 
tion”. Nevertheless, Haiti was seized 
and a treaty forced upon her by armed 
soldiers. Haiti is now held by Amer- 
ican officials receiving double salaries 
and costing the United States a mil- 
lion dollars a year. 

The report looks carefully into the 
economic and financial aspects of the 
American Occupation and shows the 
large profits which the National City 
Bank of New York City is making. 
There are two chapters on the land, 
showing how the way has been opened 
for driving out the Haitian peasants

and monopolizing the land by foreign 
corporations. A high-priced Director 
ot Agriculture at $10,000 a year has 
led as yet to no particular results. “In 
general the American Occupation has 
done little or nothing for education in 
Haiti”. In racial relations the United 
States has sent the worst class of South- 
erners to have charge of affairs, while 
the marines*have spread prostitution 
and venereal disease. Civil liberty is 
gone. Private letters are opened, edi- 
tors are imprisoned and the Commit- 
tee finally concludes: 


ss—"*ROM the point of view of 

United States interests, in the 
most ‘hard-boiled’ sense, there is little 
to be said for the continuance of our 
Occupation of Haiti. American in- 
vestments there have in general not 
proved a source of legitimate profits, 
but of loss, and there is now nothing 
to justify, from the selfish point of 
view, the continued expenditure of 
United States money in administering 
the country. 

“From the point of view of Haiti’s 
interests, it is not true that we are in 
Haiti solely as disinterested benefactors, 
nor that we can show clean hands in 
our business dealings there. If our of- 
ficials have tried to benefit the people 
of Haiti, (as we believe they have), it 
is also true that the Occupation has 
cared for American financial interests 
there, of a none too creditable sort, a 
the expense of our poor and sok 
neighbors. 

“Happily it is not the case that the 
United States is confined to the alter- 
native of either occupying Haiti, or 
else regarding her necessities with in- 
difference and unconcern. It is per- 
fectly possible to be a good neighbor 
and help Haiti to attain health, edu- 
cation, public improvements and pub- 
lic order, by other less drastic, and ul- 
timately more effective methods than 
military control. 

“The authors of this report believe 
that the Occupation should be ended 
for the sake of Haiti, for the sake of 
the United States, and especially for 
the sake of good relations among all 
American republics, and finally be- 
cause it is in itself an unjustified use 
of power.” ‘The book is published by

ORD OLIVIER is known to 
Negroes by that excellent little 
brochure on “White Capital and Col- 
ored Labor” published in 1905. He 
hes been Governor of Jamaica; a leader 
ot the English Labor Party; and took 
part in the Second and Third Pan 
African Congresses. He has now pub- 
lished (Hogarth Press, 1927) the 
“Anatomy of African Misery”. 

This is by long odds the best book 
which has appeared on the race prob- 
lem of South Africa. No person who 
wishes to be intelligent on the tremen- 
dous complications between white and 
black in this part of the world can af- 
ford to be without this small searching 
and stimulating volume. In twenty 
chapters he notes the introduction of 
slavery into South Africa by the Dutch 
East India Company; the way this 
idea of slavery was inherited by the 
incoming poor whites and the extra- 
ordinary effect produced when capital- 
ism came and began to dig diamonds. 

“The value of diamonds is, entirely 
emblematic; they are a monopolized 
symbol, the blazon of solid lucre and 
funded property, worn by women as an 
advertisement that they are maintained 
by rich men, and by men as an adver- 
tisement that they are the sort that can 
get rich quick and can lend you money. 
The special type of instinct which 
Providence had implanted in Mr. Cecil 
Rhodes unerringly inspired him to dis- 
cern that a monopoly of the supply of 
the finest diamonds was the most 
auspicious and appropriate foundation 
imaginable for a policy of commercial 
Imperialism.” 


HE tradition of slavery and caste 

exploited by capitalistic imperial- 
ism spread over the whole Southern 
half of the continent and led to aston- 
ishing contradictions and cruelties. It 
led, for instance, to giving 280,000,000 
acres of land to a million and a half 
Europeans while five million natives 
had only partial rights in 20,000,000 
acres. In other words, it set up the 
extraordinary dictum that the native 
“must not be allowed to have land in 
his own country and that any and every 
white man is entitled to have whatever 
land he wants and natives to work it”. 
And to this now the South Africans are 
trying to add further discriminations 
and exveriments to keep natives from 
being recognized (Turn to page 283)

Flying Lessons 


Calendar Chat 


ONCE saw an Arapahoe moccasin 

that was embroidered with porcu- 
pine quills dyed yellow and scarlet. I 
gazed at the moccasin and thought of 
that wandering vanquished tribe, the 
Arapahoe Indians and recalled Park- 
man’s Ardphoes of the Oregon Trail. 
Speaking of trails causes me to won- 
der if you recall Edwin Sabin’s life 
of Kit Carson and the circumstance 
of his having associated with him Jim 
Beckworth the colored man for whom 
Beckworth Pass was named. 


But I really mean to write of the 
trail of birds, not of men. For now 
birds are moving southward. On the 
first day of August I watched a bril- 
liant indigo bunting on the fence of 
a wheat field. He darted about between 
the ground and the fence as though fly- 
ing were no fine art with him. Yet I 
knew that within a few weeks he 
would be setting out upon a voyage to 
Central America. 

I once read an interesting article on 
bird travel. It mentioned the cir- 
cumstance of one’s encountering on 
one’s premises some rare bird migrant 
pausing for a brief spell in its immeas- 
urable journey. He mentioned hav- 
ing found an eagle three thousand 
miles from its winter destination cas- 
ually halting upon one of his fences. 


SAW, in a field of bronze wheat 

shocks, hosts of bronzed grackles 
foraging. They were trotting about 
like farmers over the gold stubble. Al- 
ways in flocks like the sparrows, they 
remind one of that time when they will 
assemble bevy with bevy for the long 


fall flight in October.

EFFIE LEE NEWSOME 


Their kindred, the orioles, so merry 
and busy—but even the cowbird for 
that matter is gayer—unlike the grim 
grackles have been cheerily receding all 
summer with a view to final south- 
ward flight. After the first splendors 
of spring song, after the mate had 
woven her wonderful pouch and tended 
her eggs within it and when the par- 
ents had retired with the fledglings 
to the orchard and the father had re- 
duced his song to one or two tantaliz- 
ingly vibrant notes, brief, just enough 
to help in guiding the youngsters, it 
seemed only the matter of a few days 
before their flight to sunlands. When 
the orioles migrate in the fall they 
leave behind their relatives that will 
stay to bravely face the snows, the 
meadow larks. 


Sumac 


UMAC, sure and sugar, three 

words that we can’t help think- 
ing should begin with s-h! The stag- 
horn sumac, growing cheerily by thick- 
ets of blackberry and wild rose is a 
bush of no pretentions. You might 
spell it any way, just so you got pleas- 
ure from the sight of its ruddy fruit 
and later the scarlet foliage. Red 
Riding Hood had no gayer cap than 
the velvety seeded crimson fruit that 
glows in cone shaped clusters among 
the green sumac leaves. 

Long after the fruit has changed 
from scarlet to rust brown, from rust 
to sepia the leaves turn turkey red as 
though a colorless sumac were scarcely 
to be conceived. The red glows out 
boldly when October skies are dull. 


A Black Boy Dreams 


TROT on with the silver streams, 
And laugh and build my little 
dreams. 
I trip on with the lively brooks 
Through meadowland and wood. 
Ha, ho! How merrily I run! 
To dream and move along is fun. 
I tread the meads of yesterday 
Where once the Indians used to play. 
The soil belonged to white men next.. - 
How many changes it has known! 
For now it is my father’s own! 
I trot on with these silver streams, 
And laugh and build my little dreams, 
Ha, ho, how merrily I run! 
To dream yet move along is fun. 


Bob White All Right? 


[7 seems to me the quiet quail 

When he steps through the stubble 
So smoothly with his head thrown back, 
As though it were no trouble, 

Is not saying his name at all, 


But asking this politely, 
“Bob White all right? 
Bob White all right?” 


In sounds so clear and sprightly. 


The Umbrella Man 
‘TSE man who mends umbrellas up, 


He’s wonderful, that’s all. 
He even fixes flabby ones 
With broken stays that sprawl. 


He sits right down on your back steps, 
And does his mending there. 

He fastens wrinkled tops to wires, 
And smooths them down with care. 


I’m certain he has lots of time, 
At least, it seems that way. 

He lifts the mended ones up high 
To see if they will stay, 


Then closes them and tries again, 
Just whistling quietly. 

The bag that holds his mending things 
Is lying on his knee. 


He shakes the old umbrellas out, 
When all the mending’s through, 
Tells what it cost and nods and says, 
“You've got a good job, too.” 


He thanks you when the paying’s done, 

Then goes off, slow, to find 

More work right in your meighbor’s 
yard, 

Just of that very kind. 


You look and see him through the fence 
All bent with knees up high, 

And hear him whistling those same tunes 
He did your mending by.

THE FAR HORIZON 








TO ALL OPPRESSED PEOPLES 
AND CLASSES 


HE MORE one reads the litera- 

ture as sent out by the Brussels 
Congress against Colonial Oppression, 
the more one is impressed by its earn- 
estness and ability. A ‘‘Manifesto to 
All Oppressed Peoples” is the latest 
oftering from which we quote: 

The proud edifice of European and 
later of American capitalism has been 
erected on the sweat and blood of the 
colonial peoples. Horrible slavery, in- 
human maltreatment, forced labor and 
in some cases the complete extermination 
ot whole races and cultures so that 
scarcely the name remains, have been 
the means to this end. .. . 

The end of the 19th and the beginning 
of the 20th century saw the final divi- 
sion of the world between a group of 
imperialist powers. A few great powers 
at the bidding of a small group of indi- 
viduals controlling immense stores of ac- 
cumulated capital, brought the whole 
world under their control with the as- 
sistance of rifles and bayonets and the 
most modern murder technique. The 
struggle of these imperialist powers 
amongst themselves for the last stretches 
of undivided land, and the demand of 
countries more recently imperialist for 
the redivision of the world led finally to 
the greatest catastrophe and greatest 
crime in the history of the world—the 
great World War. 

But this fearful cataclysm which 
drenched the land of the two Continents 
with blood did not abolish, the awful sys- 
tem of which it was itself the fruit. The 
imperialist powers are grimly hanging on 
to the booty which threatened to slip 
from their hands and which they paid so 
much to retain. The murder of millions 
of men, including hundreds of thousands 
of colonial slaves from India and the 
African possessions of France, did not 
end the mad scramble for possession. 
Fascist Italy has taken the place of im- 
perialist Germany in the struggle for co- 
lonial possessions. Even in Germany it- 
self, the privileged classes who have re- 
stored their economic and political power 
and forgotten the bitter taste of foreign 
tule are again striving to win for them- 
selves the right to oppress other peoples. 

That is the inexcusable logic of the 
system under which mankind is groan- 
ing. The present economic system which 
exhausted the European masses during 
the war is to-day less than ever able to 
exist without the, subjection of whole na- 
tionalities and the resulting excess profits. 
The less capitalism is in a position to en- 
sure the well-being of the European 
masses and above all of the proletarian 
masses, the more it is compelled to seek 
markets for its goods on foreign con-

tinents which can be controlled by force. 
The development of monopolist capital 
transformed a small clique in the im- 
perialist countries, above all in the An- 
glo-Saxon countries, into the masters of 
the world. 

The World War showed the deep divi- 
sions of world capitalism, but not only 
that, the imperialists were compelled to 
set up the slogan of self-determination as 
a way out of their difficulties. After the 
war, the oppressed and enslaved peoples 
took the imperialists at their word. A 
mighty movement for national emancipa- 
tion passed over immense territories in 
Asia, Africa and America. The banner 
of revolt was raised in China, India, 
Egypt, North-West Africa, Indonesia 
and the Philippines. This great move- 
ment received a mighty impetus from the 


Russian revolution which smashed the’ 


power of Russian imperialism, freed hun- 
dreds of races and Nationalities ex- 
ploited by the Tsarist Empire and estab- 
lished the rule of the proletariat upon the 
basis of a free federation of free peoples. 
The Workers State is the flaming torch 
lighting the oppressed peoples of the 
world along the path to freedom and in- 
dependence. 

This mighty will to freedom and inde- 
pendence will never again be broken. 
Only fools can believe that the civiliza- 
tion of to-day and of the future will be 
confined to Europe and the United States 
of America. The struggle of the Asiatic, 
American and African peoples for na- 
tional emancipation in alliance with the 
proletariat of the imperialist countries, 
is the force which will abolish interna- 
tional capitalism and civilize the whole 
world. 


SOCIAL EQUALITY 
L. HUTCHERSON writes 


* us from Emporia: 

Emporia! a city of some 18,000 popu- 
lation, in north central Kansas, the seat 
of two colleges, and the Gazette, edited 
by William Allen White! But, in Em- 
poria they have a Young Men’s Chris- 
tion Association! Well, so have several 
hundred other cities, small towns and vil- 
lages! Why make reference to the Y. 
M. C. A. in Emporia? Because, in its 
membership, you will find boys of all 
the race and national groups that live 
in the city. Yes, Negro boys! Using the 
building, to be sure. The Father and Son 
Banquet for colored men and their boys 
have been held in the building for five 
years. 

Each year, the Civic Clubs of Em- 
poria, cooperate with the Y. M. C. A. 
in sending a group of under-privileged 
boys to the State Y. M. C. A. Boys’ 
Camp. And for six years they have in- 
cluded Negro boys. This year—1927, 
eight of the forty boys sent to camp are 


colored. 

In the game rooms; lobby; on the 
Gym. floor and in the pool! Yes, in the 
pool, you will find Negro boys! 

Yes, Emporia has a Klavern of the Ku 
Klux Klan. But, it also has L. A. Duffy, 
City Boys’ Work Secretary, De Witt 
Lee, General Secretary, William Allen 
White and the Emporia Gazette. 

And would you believe it, there has 
been neither an earthquake nor falling of 
the stars in Emporia! 


We take this paragraph from The 
Survey: 


An experiment in race relations, be- 
gun in a small way two years ago, will 
be part of the Summer School for 
Workers in Industry at the University 
of Wisconsin. Each Negro girl enrolling 
for the six-weeks’ course in English, 
economics and physical education for 
“girls who work with the tools of trade” 
will be offered the choice of living in a 
Negro home known to the University as 
a satisfactory boarding-place, or in a 
campus house in which girls of both 
races live on an equal footing. A cen- 
trally located house with accommoda- 
tions for twenty girls has been secured. 
It has two connecting livingrooms, suit- 
able for general meetings, and will pro- 
vide a center for the entire industrial 
group. A university Y. W. C. A. sec- 
retary will act as chaperone. The white 
residents will be those who, before com- 
ing to the school, signify their desire to 
take a part in this inter-racial experi- 
ment. 

And yet despite this, in Flushing, al- 
most a suburb of New York City, 
colored boys, including the son of the 
Executive Secretary of the National 
Urban League, have been refused mem- 
bership in the Y. M. C. A. This 
building was erected opposite the pub- 
lic high school and high school stud- 
ents and citizens, colored and white, 
were appealed to to help build it. 


THE STRUGGLING SOUTH 


HE Macon (Ga.) Telegraph has a 
long editorial on the “Aspects of 
the Problem’”’. 


The question of the relations of the 
white and colored races in this country 
is being illuminated from several angles 
just now by an almost simultaneous 
series of events. The Supreme Court’s 
decision on the Texas primary case, of 
course, is the most conspicuous of these. 
The New Orleans segregation ordinance 
is being argued before the same court, 
with the prospect of a decision favorable 
to the Negro plaiatiff. The reduction of 
the sentences of twenty Negro mutineers 
who killed their white officers and ter- 
rorized the city of Houston, Texas, in 


273 






















































































































































































































































































































































































































































1917 probably will have its reaction in 


that state. Senator Cole Blease, of 
South Carolina, has returned to his con- 
stituents with the report that white 


supremacy is at stake in the Pennsyl- 


yania and Illinois ballot scandals. The 
University of Georgia was recently 
treated to a demonstration of what a 


zealous worker for more equable race 
relations may look for in certain quar- 
ters in the South. Literature and the 
stage are dealing with phases of misce- 
genation and kindred matters with a 
frankness that would have been disas- 
trous to the public peace a few years ago 
—witness Lulu Belle, Ninth Avenue, All 
God’s Chillun Got Wings, The Sailor’s 
Return and almost any number of others 
which hardly ruffle the surface of today’s 
strong currents. 


Those in the South who are more in- 
terested in peace and a square deal than 
they are “keeping the nigger in his place” 
are still liable to bitter and powerful op- 
position, as an assistant secretary of the 
University of Georgia’s Young Men’s 
Christian Association recently discovered. 
This young man had been assisting in 
inter-racial meetings in and _ about 
Athens. His work came under the 
scrutiny of one of the most influential 
members of the board of trustees of the 
university, who immediately demanded 
his official head and a large chunk of his 
body. The consequent uproar on the 
campus drove him off and the secretary 
still holds his job, in spite of being ac- 
cused of treason to “white supremacy” 
and affiliation with the Russian Soviet 
Government. The most instructive part 
of this episode was the immediate and 
vociferous protest of the students against 
the trustee’s intention. College students, 
in mass, are seldom much interested in 
or worried by unpleasant things that may 
happen to Y. M. C. A. secretaries. Their 
reaction in this-case would seem to indi- 
cate that there is one group of Southern 
students which is more interested in jus- 
tice and a reasonable amount of personal 
liberty than they are in maintaining a 
fetish of “supremacy.” 

This supremacy business is coming to 
a new turn in the road. A very con- 
siderable portion of the dominant race is 
coming to look upon a supremacy based 
on artificial and unnecessary barriers and 
discriminations as nothing much to be 
proud of. A goodly portion of the white 
population begins to see that, although 
there may be and often is good and sufh- 
cient reason for binding a person’s legs, 
there is no great glory in distancing him 
in a foot race while the gyves. are on his 
feet. 


It is coming to be seen that the Negro 
is working toward a goal separate from 
that of the white race, although their 
paths must run parallel. The racial aims 
and aspirations of the Negro are coming 
to be respected and encouraged by his 
white fellow citizens as legitimate and 
desirable. White persons are beginning 
to see that there can be no lasting bene- 
fit in keeping a portion of the population 
as closely approximating serfdom as can 
be encompassed by community custom 
and devious legal technicalities. 


274 


To this we may append two occur- 
rences in North Carolina: 

In the Durham Morning Herald for 
August 5, 1927, appears an article un- 
der the caption “CONSCIENCE 
HURT HIM; SURRENDERS.” This 
article relates an incident wherein Man- 
ly Justice shot and fatally wounded Earl 
Williams, both white, and says in part: 

“After Williams had been wounded by 
one bullet fired by Justice. Wil- 
liams begged him not to shoot again, 
promising to tell officers that a Negro 
had done the shooting if his life were 
spared.” 

Williams maintained until death that 
a Negro shot him when he was really 
shot by Manly Justice, white. 

Before the truth of the matter re- 
ferred to above was made known, a mob, 


or posse, had instituted a “man-hunt” 
for “a” Negro. 

In the press of August 15, 1927, ap- 
peared an article under the caption 


“FATAL ACCIDENT CAUSES AR- 





Helen Eloise had no Home, 
Crisis found her a lovely one. Would you 
like a littie brown fairy in your home? 


but THE 


REST OF BUS DRIVER”; this article 
said in part: 

“Baswell Green, Negro, is dead and 
Everett Fish, white, bus driver is out 
under bond on the charge of manslaugh- 
ter. . Another Negro was seriously 
and probably fatally injured, while four 
white people received injuries of varying 
degrees of seriousness. 

Sweeping down Vickers Avenue at a 
rate of speed estimated by a passenger 
at around 40, the bus met the lighter car 
as the latter was crossing the intersec- 
tion. Through the impact of the 
collision the bus was overturned and the 
other car knocked approximately 20 feet. 

Following an investigation by the po- 
lice into the accident, which according 
to their findings, showed the car occu- 
pied by the Negroes had the right of way, 








under the terms of the state law, a war- 
rant charging manslaughter was served 
on Fish. Bond in the sum of $500 was 
given. . ~ 

In the same paper on the following 
morning appeared another article under 
the caption “WINSTON SALEM OF- 
FICER IS DEAD _ FROM sIN.- 
JURIES”; this article said in part: 

“Thomas G. Anderson, motorcycle of- 
ficer, died today from injuries received 
last Thursday in a collision. Will 
Lowery, Negro, driver of an automobile 
truck, which collided with the motor- 
cycle on which Anderson was riding, has 
been arrested on a charge of man- 
slaughter and is out under $5,000 bond.” 

From the facts brought out in these 
two cases, Everett Fish, the bus driver, 
was in the fault according to the state 
law, as a result of this he was placed 
under a five hundred dollar bond; how- 
ever, no allegation was made to the ef- 
fect that Will Lowery, the truck driver, 
was in the fault according to the state 
law, and yet, he was placed under a five 
thousand dollar bond. 


4 SERV ANT OF AMERICA 
R. WILLIAM H. HUNT who 


has served many years as United 
States Consul at St. Etienne, Loire, 
France, has been transferred to Guade- 
loupe. Le Memorial de la Loire, the 
local paper says: 

L’excellent consul des Etats-Unis et 
Mme. Hunt ont quitté, hier aprés-midi, 
notre ville, se dirigeant sur Bordeaux 
d’ot ils s’embarqueront le 27 courant 
pour le nouveau poste qui été-assigné 2 
M. Hunt. 

Sur le quai de la gare de Chateau- 
creux, ils ont été salués par de nombreaux 
amis qui leurs ont exprimé avec leurs re- 
grets pour leur départ, leurs meilleurs 
souhaits de bonheur. 

Citons: .MM. Jean Neyret, ancien 
maire; Jaray; Colcombet, Schuemacher, 
Rivoire, docteur Castaing, commandant

Tardy, etc., ainsi que de nombreuses 
dames. 

A St. Etienne on gardera longtemps | 
souvenir de ce couple charmant, qui 
avait obtenu chez nous entiérement dro't

What a curious way for the United 
States to reward a faithful public ser- 
vant. Mr. Hunt is sent from a busy 
district in the center of France to a 
tiny island in the Caribbean with no 
increase in pay or standing. 





DAYTONA BEACH—H. A. Patter-

sion of “thanks.”

CHILDREN 

HE Crisis published its first Chil- 

dren’s Number in October, 1912. 
Thus this issue marks our Sixteenth 
annual reminder to the black people 
of America that children are rather 
important; that if we propose to con- 
quer this earth for the principles of 
democracy regardless of race, and for 
the open door to genius regardless of 
color, we must not only bring children 
into the world, but we must train them 
after they arrive. 

The stress of psychology in the last 
few years has been put upon the im- 
portance of the training which children 
get before they enter school. “Be- 
haviorism” asserts that the child is 
practically made into the human be- 
ing which he is going to be in these 
earlier years and that all this emphasis 
which we have been putting upon here- 
dity is mainly nonsense. While the 
new psychology may thus over-empha- 
size social environment, certainly and 
without the slightest doubt, the older 
psychology and the older education 
went violently and illogically to the 
other extreme. Colored fathers and 
mothers must learn that the atmo- 
sphere of the home, the denizens of 
the street, the playmates of their chil- 
dren, the culture of the Negro quar- 
ter—all these things are perhaps the 
largest factors in making the future 
men and women of the Negro race. 


DEATH RATES 


HE difficulty about nearly all sta- 

tistical matter with regard to the 
Negro in the United States is the 
rather astonishing habit which we have 
of comparing all our figures with simi- 
lar figures relating to whites. In most 
cases the comparisons are misleading 
because the groups are not at all simi- 
lar. Here is a great mass of white 
people, aided by large immigration in 
the past and considerable in the pres- 
ent, with the advantage of hospital 
service, trained physicians, sanitary 
homes and selected areas for the richer 
classes. There. is neither sense nor 
illumination in comparing the death 
rate of that group with the death rate 
of American Negroes, only a genera- 
tion removed from slavery, under 
great mental and physical stress by 


October, 1927

Negro death rate per 1,000 living, U. S. A. 


reason of prejudice and migration, and 
under severe economic pressure. 

The group can only be compared 
with its own status in the past, to note 
progress; and such a comparison shows 
that the Negro death rate has been 
reduced 50 per cent. in the last forty 
years. The Negro has reduced his in- 
fant mortality and his death rate from 
scurges like tuberculosis. His better- 
ment in health has been most striking 
and encouraging, as Louis I. Dublin, 
statistician of the Metropolitan Life 
Insurance Company, proves in the 
September American Mercury. Of 
course, there is still room and need for 
improvement, but the present Ameri- 
can Negro death rate is as low as that 
of most European countries and con- 
siderable lower than that of Spain, 
Hungary, Russia, and the countries of 


South America. 


ELKS 


HE meeting of the colored Elks 

in Harlem during August was 

one of the most astonishing and hope- 
ful occurrences that has ever taken 
place among Negroes of America. 
Never before has a great city been so 
elaborately and beautifully decorated 
for a visiting convention. There must 
have been at least six miles of flags, 
bunting and electric lights which 
turned High Harlem into fairyland. 
Then there poured into this colored 
city, between 125th and 145th Streets 
and from the crags of Washington 
Heights to the Harlem River, a crowd 
of visitors estimated as high as fifty 
thousand. Streets were crowded day 
and night with automobiles, buses, 


men, women and children. Theatres, 
dance halls, churches and _ cabarets 
were wide open. Private homes were 
filled with gay parties and entertain- 
ments. And yet the police force was 
not perceptibly increased in number; 
there was almost no disorder of any 
sort; there was very little drunken- 


ness; very little quarreling. It was 
a happy, beautiful party. 
The conference despite strong 


rivalry for office and many matters of 
difference and dispute went off appar- 
ently without a hitch, and the parade, 
even in the rain, was a moving spec- 
tacle; while the great ball in the 
armory of the Negro regiment was 
little less than magnificent. 

The white city humming below was 
literally struck dumb. The New York 
W orld had regular accounts as usual. 
Some of the other papers had a note 
now and then; but for the most part 
there was no news, no comment, no 
pictures; the white city sat and stared. 


JOHNSTON 


HE death of Sir Henry Hamil- 

ton Johnston at the age of sixty- 
nine has come in England. Sir Harry 
Johnston, as he. was better known, 
probably knew more and had written 
more of the history and condition of 
African Negroes than any living man. 
He was born in London in 1858 and 
first entered Africa at the age of twen- 
ty-two. He became an explorer and 
writer, a Vice Consul and Consul in 
the English service and finally Spe- 
cial Commissioner to Uganda. He 
was liberal in all matters and one who, 
with all his eccentricities, believed in 
the Negro race. The Editor has long

is seventy-five years old and 
America has been sending him con- 
gratulations. In these good words 
black America should have no small 
part. He has been a friend to Negroes. 
He has helped with his money; with 
his wide influence as a Southerner; 
and with his kindly heart. He does 


275 


not believe altogether in Negro col- 
leges or in the social intermingling of 
the races or in the Fifteenth Amend- 
ment; but he believes so much more 
than most Southerners of education 
and insight, and believes it so earnestly, 
that his life has been a benediction to 
the nation. 
THE TERRIBLE TRUTH 

E who are black can sympathize 

with Sacco and Vanzetti and 
their friends more than other Ameri- 
cans. We are used to being convicted 
because of our race and opinions and 
regardless of our proven guilt. We 
are used to seeing judge, jury and pub- 
lic opinion lay down the rule: “Bet- 
ter ten innocent Negroes lynched, than 
one guilty one go free!” We can see, 
South and North, changes for the bet- 
ter from the day when this extraordi- 
nary reversal of a common law maxim 
was dominant; and yet the public exe- 
cution of these two Italian anarchists 
makes us know that we have not gone 
so very far after all. 

We must not allow ourselves to 
forget a far less widely known case. 
August 29, 1919, Maurice F. Mays 
of Knoxville, Tennessee, was arrested 
and charged with the murder of a 
white woman, Mrs. Bertie Lindsey. 
On October 4th, he was convicted of 
murder in the first degree. ‘There 
was no charge to the jury in sentenc- 


ing him. The court was prejudiced 
to such an extent that the trial judge 
would not or did not hear witnesses 


for the defense”. The police were 
against Mays because he had been “in 
politics”. ‘The community wanted to 
lynch him. 

The case was appealed to the Ten- 
nessee Supreme Court and heard in 
January, 1920. The judgment of the 
lower court was set aside on a tech- 
nicality and Mays was tried again in 
April, 1921. He brought in witnesses 
to establish a complete alibi. Never- 
theless, he was again found guilty of 
murder in the first degree and ordered 
to be executed June 26, 1921. The 
case was again appealed, but the State 
Supreme Court upheld the lower court 
and set the execution for December 
15th. On December 14th, through 
the efforts of the N. A. A. C. P. and 
his friends, a respite of ninety days 
was granted. Commutation of the 
sentence to life imprisonment was 
asked, but it was all in vain. On 
March 15, 1922, Maurice Mays was 
executed. 

Six years later, in August, 1927, 
the Chief of Police of Norton, Vir- 
ginia, informed the Knoxville author- 
ities that Mrs. Sadie Mendil, a white 
woman of twenty-eight, had confessed 
to the murder of Mrs. Lindsey. Her 
name at the time was Mrs. John 


276 


MAURICE MAYS 
Officially murdered by the State of 
Tennessee, 1922 


Roddy and she lived at Devonia, Ten- 
nessee. “Dressed in men’s clothes and 
with her face blackened, according to 
her story, she slipped into the Lind- 
sey woman’s home and killed her in 
bed. She did so, she said, because a 
few nights previous she had trailed 
her husband, a traveling man, to the 
Lindsey home, and had seen her hus- 
band and the Lindsey woman to- 
gether”. Mrs. Mendii, despite her 
confession, was released because the 
record showed ‘“‘no charge against the 
woman”. Maurice Mays had borne 
that charge to his grave, because’ he 
was a Negro and “in politics”. 
MENCKEN 

ANY colored people have under- 

taken to answer Mr. Mencken’s 
remarks about Negro artists. Most 
of them apparently make the mistake 
of questioning his attitude rather than 
his facts. There can be no question of 
H. L. Mencken’s attitude toward Ne- 
groes. It is calmly and judiciously 
fair. He neither loves nor hates them. 
He has a predilection for men. 

But he, like many other Americans, 
does not understand just where the 
shoe pinches. When American artists 
of Negro descent have work worth 
while he believes that they are not 
barred by magazines or publishers. Of 
course not. But the point is that the 


themes on which Negro writers natu-’ 


rally write best, with deepest know]- 
edge and clearest understanding, are 
precisely the themes which most edi- 
tors do not want treated. These are 
themes which white readers are tired 
of or do not wish to hear. What is 
the “freedom” cry to a white American 
or “discrimination”? He is fed up on 
this which is the breath of life to black 
folk. While the feelings of insulted 
men, their reaction to the color line 
—well this he will not read about. 


Consequently the chief reading public 
in America will not buy precisely the 
sort of thing that Negroes must write 
about if they are sincere and honest. 

White Americans are willing to read 
about Negroes, but they prefer to read 
about Negroes who are fools, clowns, 
prostitutes, or at any rate, in despair 
and contemplating suicide. Other 
sorts of Negroes do not interest them 
because, as they say, they are “just 
like white folks’. But their interest 
in white folks, we notice, continues. 
This is a real and tremendous handi- 
cap. It is analogous to the handicap 
of all writers on unpopular themes; 
but it bears hardest on young Negroes 
because its bar is broader and more in- 
clusive.- It puts a premium on one 
kind of sadistic subject. 

Despite this, Mr. Mencken does not 
realize all that has been done. If the 
really first rate books written by Ne- 
groes since the Civil War make “a 
shelf a foot long”, that is a matter of 
congratulation. Similar notable works 
by white Americans would be a good 
deal less than nine feet long. In music, 
Nathaniel Dett has given the Negro 
spiritual another form and Harry Bur- 
leigh has done more than reproduce it. 
W. C. Handy is father of the “Blues”. 
Coleridge-Taylor, if we may be per- 
mitted a journey overseas, stands mani- 
festly the great creative artist with his 
“Bamboula” and ‘Take Nabandji’; 
and there is Roland Hayes—is he not 
an artist? There may, of course, be 
difference of opinion about Negro 
poets, but in our opinion Paul Lau- 
rence Dunbar, Claude McKay, Coun- 
tée Cullen and Langston Hughes 
stand far above “second rate”. We 
are inclined too to think that Ches- 
nutt’s novels are far above “the level 
of white hacks”. Jean Toomer’s 
work will not soon be forgotten and 
Booker T. Washington’s “Up From 
Slavery” is no ordinary biography. 
Jessie Fauset and Eric Walrond de- 
serve notice. Finally, we have H. O. 
Tanner. 

On the whole then, despite a stimu- 
lating critic’s opinion, we Negroes are 
quite well satisfied with our Renais- 
sance. And we have not yet finished.

Exceptional Negro Children 


(From page 259) were unearthed in a 
small group and our data, with several 
rules of the game slightly modified, 
brought out startling exceptions. Stud- 
ents of race advancement, of cultural 
development, are united today in be- 
lieving that progress comes not so much 
through a general high level within the 
group, as from the degree to which the 
group proliferates exceptional individ- 
uals. To know that exceptional indi- 
viduals are being proliferated in our 
race today is indeed “Balm in Gilead” 
to ease our discouraged hopes for racial 
betterment. 


HAT lesson may we glean from 

this study? One interesting fact 
stands forth from a study of this kind. © 
No matter how high in the social scale 
the family may be, the exceptional chil- 
dren in this study came from homes 
where someone had encouraged the 
child to read. The work of Dr. Adler of 
Vienna has indicated—Arnold Gessell 
at Yale has vindicated—the theory that 
mental superiority in children is more 
largely the product of vigorous mental 
stimulation during the first three years 
of life than at any time afterward.- 
Negro parents are too inclined, along 
with parents of other races, to regard 
signs of super-normality in their chil- 
dren with distrust and fear. They 
want their children to be “normal”, 
to play with all of the other children, 
to grow up in practical savagery until 
they are of school age—a period so 
long deferred that the major habits of 
the child are likely to be firmly fixated 
for life at the school entrance period. 
It may be laid down as a certain law 
that children can be taught to read as 
soon as they are able to talk or walk. 
It is a most tragic sight to see parents 
leaving to wretched schools the simple 
educational duties which would prove 
a lasting solution to the educational 
problems of their children, if attended 
to personally. No matter how “busy”, 
the Negro parent desirous of seeing his 
children succeed in life should spare at 
least enough time to teach the child 
how to read—with pleasure—before he 
is, at the oldest, five years of age. The 
Negro parent who is able should by all 
means supplement the class-room in- 
struction of his progeny. 

What will result from such extra 
advantages afforded the child? Will 
it make the child “old before his day”, 
or “anti-social”, or eccentric, as the 
common impression of the advanced 
child runs? By no means; we now 
know that the healthiest and most ac- 
tive children are those advanced in 
school and the unhealthiest, the most 
retarded cases. Such special treatment 
will undoubtedly eliminate from two to 
six years from the time necessary to

equip the child for high school. This 
may sound outrageous—but the handi- 
caps imposed upon a Negro teacher in 
the typical school system result in that 
teacher covering a ridiculously small 
amount of ground, such as could easily 
be covered by the bright child in three 
or four years of formal instruction 
supplemented by careful home instruc- 
tion. Granted that two years be saved 
in the eight-grade course; this means 
additional insurance toward enter- 
ing a profession and active earning 
capacity before the individual is super- 
annuated. As much as educaticn costs 
today, the saving of two years as a 
minimum is not to be scoffed at. 
UR prize exhibit, so to speak, is 
the child Willia Mae Baucom. 
She is four years and ten months old. 
She passed all tests normally given to 


4-year, 5-year, 6-year, and 7-year old 
children (white) with ease. Her 
1. Q., accordingly, is 142. An inter- 


view with the mother elicited the in- 
formation that the child had been given 
careful attention in the home; had been 
encouraged to read, to ask questions 
and in every way given mental stimu- 
lation at the earliest age possible. What 
may we not say of this little dark child 
of genius? Before her stretch illimit- 
able avenues of potential achievement. 
One does not need to be a prophet to 
say that she can be “pushed”—a better 
term would be Jead—through the 8- 
grade grammar school course by the 
time she is ten years old. Nor, as we 
have emphasized, need the parents of 
this child fear for her health. It is 
impossible to reckon the vast number 
of brilliant children who have lost from 
two to four years advantage in their 
education due to the foolish supersti- 
tion that it is “dangerous” to promote 
a child above his year-grade, or for the 
child to “skip” grades. 

One hopes, instinctively, that the 
fates may be kind to this child, whose 
I. Q. is superior to about 997 out of 
every 1000 white children. Will op- 
portunities to develop this talent come 
to her, or will the rich promise of the 
early years be snuffed out by poor 
teachers, poor schools, un-ambitious 
playmates, or the depressing weight of 
prejudice? If our violation of the rules 
of the psychological game here de- 


scribed do nothing more than urge 


Negro parents to see that children like 
the ones referred to here receive every 
opportunity, we shall feel that the ef- 
fort is warranted and that its repeti- 
tion is demanded.

rol Moore’s listing in her Crossroads 
to Childhood, the buoyant tale of Moby 
Dick, nothing apart from its towering 
black hero who to me always suggests 
Winslow Homer’s “Gulf Stream”. 

Speaking of adventure. There are 
the busy pygmies of Leo Walmsley’s 
Toro of the Little People (New York: 
Doran). Here is a childhood thriller, 
a series of experiences in Pygmyland in 
the forest of Always Night, Africa. 
Toro reigns as hero in the midst of 
marvelous scenes and accounts of the 
resourcefulness of the “little people”. 

While writing of Africa I have 
thought of Homespun Heroines by 
Hallie Q. Brown (Aldine Pub. Co.). 
This is a book of brief bright life 
sketches of eminent colored women and 
contains little intimate side lights ob- 
tained with much care. Particularly 
fresh among these studies is an account 
of a pepper tree quilt made for Queen 
Victoria by a native of West Africa. 
After the fanciful creation in yellow, 
green and gold was completed there 
loomed the challenge of how to get it 
into the queen’s hands. And the man- 
ner in which this was effected and 
just what the queen did reads like a 
fairy tale. 


AM sure I would have liked even 

in childhood to read these stories, 
just as I would have enjoyed discover- 
ing through Famous Sculpture (New 
York: Century Co.) how the law of 
frontality originated with Egyptian 
artists. Knowing all this of dark peo- 
ple I might have gazed at the little 
Greek everywhere, never particular 
about serving me his frozen goods and 
sweets and yet from whose ancient 
shores were wafted to my child fancies 
much that was superb in legend— 
could I not have early met him with 
this mental challenge, “May not / 
pick up red Antares where he dropped 
it or restore to the VICTORY its 
head ?”

the school and tried to work but he 


was still so upset that he could not stay.

At the 


murder. 


20, 1927, saying: “I have now finished 
twenty-five years at Okolona with the 
most sympathetic and lovable Board 
of Trustees in the world. In this I 
am including all former members of 
the Board—Messrs. Walter McDou- 
gall, Edwin R. Embree and others, 
including the late Dr. Joseph French 
Johnson, Messrs. George W. Cable, 
Phil McIntosh, Moses Williams and 
B. J. Abbott. 

“My calm and deliberate judgment, 
after prayers and tears, is that a quar- 
ter of a century completes my task at 
Okolona. I, therefore, in final deci- 


sion tender my resignation to take ef- 
fect at once.” 

This for the public; but in a private 
letter to a friend, which we have seen, 
he adds: “J found that I was stifling 
in the South!” 


- 


HERE now is the real trouble 

in this astonishing case of mur- 
der and the practical suppression of all 
publicity concerning it for nearly two 
years? It lies in the fact that the 
Episcopal Church is at a serious dis- 
advantage when it tries to deal with 
the Negro problem. It is the one great 
church in America which did not split 
on the subject of slavery. Often it 
boasts of this fact; and unity is a thing 
to boast of. Nevertheless this very 
fact of union spells paralysis on the 
Negro problem. The _ Episcopal 
Church, although the richest in the 
United States and the first Protestant 
church among Negroes, has done least 
for the Negro in America. It has 
repudiated all efforts to increase its 
Negro membership and it thas until re- 
cently supported few Negro schools. 
Whenever Episcopalians try to take a 
high moral stand on any phase of the 
race problem they find themselves 
blocked by their Southern white con- 
stituents. 

This does not mean that the white 
Episcopal South believes in lynching, 
mob violence and ignorance for Ne- 
groes. It does mean that these South- 
ern white churchmen still cling to the 
old idea of speaking for Negroes and 
working for them and preventing all 
self-assertion on their part. They still 
refuse to permit any criticism of the 
action of the white South toward Ne- 
groes and.they are determined to pre- 
tend that Southern civilization in its 
attitude toward black folk is the best 
in the United States if not in the 
world. 

When now the church faces such 
an episode as the Okolona murder it . 
suffers moral paralysis. This murder 
in broad daylight was an affront to the 
Episcopal Church as well as white civ- 
ilization and the acquittal of the mur- 
derers for lack of evidence in the face 
of that cold dead corpse was an out- 
rageous travesty on justice. The pre- 
tense of self-defense was shameless. 
Despite this every pressure has been 
brought to bear by the officials of the 
Episcopal Church; first, to keep the 
facts of this case from being known; 
second, to keep them from being pub- 
lished; third, to keep any outside per- 
son or organizations from trying to 
secure justice or publicity; fourth, to 
compel Battle to keep silent and to in- 
duce him to go back to his work at 
the school.

(From page 266) or paid as skilled 
laborers. The author quotes a letter: 

“The attitude of the colonists is ab- 
solutely suicidal. They rely solely on 
machine guns for their supremacy. All 
the labor of the country is performed 
by natives: the whites are degenerating 
very quickly; they have been morally 
defeated by the native’s power of suf- 
fering, by his tenacity of life and lastly 
but most importantly, by the black 
man’s sense of humor.” 


T is useless to try to quote further 

the excellent things in this book. 
The fact of the matter is as Lord 
Olivier insists that South Africa is 
wrecking civilization in its attempt to 
push the aspiring and educated Ne- 
groes down below the lazy, impudent 
and good-for-nothing white man. In 
his concluding chapter he says: 

“The immediate provocation to the 
writing of this Anatomy has been the 
new departure of the South African 
Government, unique in the history of 
civilized peoples, in importing the prin- 
ciple of the color bar into the industrial 
law of a state heretofore based on the 
Christian and British Imperial theory 
of equal human rights. That declara- 
tion is a menace to the peace of the 
world.”

HE July Sphere, an English pe-

W. Wilson on “The Clash of Colour”. 
The statement which amuses us most 
is: “The American Negro is under- 
going what has been called, somewhat 
bluntly, a bleaching process. His skin 
is losing the sun-burn. ... . It is the 
bleaching of the Negro that to-day 
embitters race relations”. According 
to Mr. Wilson the colored beauty par- 
lors must be coining money. 
No one should miss reading E. 


Franklin Frazier’s opinion of ‘The ° 


Negro in the Industrial South” in the 
July 27 issue of The Nation. It is a 
frank and straight-forward picture of 
the status of the colored man in in- 
dustry and it has some undeniably 
truthful corollaries. Mr. Frazier, in 
maintaining that the Negro must seek 
co-operation with white labor gives 
examples which prove that where 
white labor has unselfishly attempted 
to organize Negro labor, the result 
has been a marked success for the bet-

WISH to thank the Pulpit, the Press and the Public for 
your unselfish support given me in the recent crisis 
through which PORO COLLEGE has passed. 

No less do I wish to express my appreciation for the many 
messages of interest and sympathy which have come to me; for 
the tender spoken word; and for the prayers of the faithful that 
an Institution dedicated to my race might stand untouched. 

And I am grateful for the unprecedented demonstration of 
racial solidarity presented. 

Your friendly interest, loyalty and prayers 
during the recent upheaval have lightened, 
more than any other agency could have 
lightened, the way to bigger endeavor. 

In recognition whereof, I rededicate to my 
people PORO COLLEGE, and reconsecrate it

terment of laboring and wage condi- 
tions for both black and white. 

If you have never seen the life of 
Lenox Avenue, if you have never 
breathed the emotion of Harlem, if 
you have never danced in close-bodied 
rhythm with hundreds of black people 
in warm, smoky up-town New York 
cabarets—if you have never done any 
one of these things—read Rudolph 
Fisher’s “Blades of Steel” in the At- 
lantic Monthly for August. In our 
opinion it is quite the best bit we have 
seen from Mr. Fisher’s pen. 

“White Man” by Grace Lumpkin, 
the story of an untutored colored girl 
of the Mississippi flood districts who 
comes to grief at the hands of the hus- 
hand of her employer, appears in the 
New Masses for September. The 
heroine follows docilely wherever the 
“White Man” leads and finally, when 
she is left in the lurch and dare not 
disclose her condition to her mother, 
loses herself in the driftwood of the 
flood. The story is sympathetically 
written in an easy, flowing style; but 
somehow we get the feeling that Miss 
Lumpkin believes her story typical of 
Negro womanhood. 


With one Olympic gesture Walter 
White tells of “The Negro and his 
Problems” in the latest issue of the 
Haldeman-Julius Quarterly. In his 
discussion of theories of solution of 
the race problem, Mr. White comes 
to the conclusion that it can not be 
solved by placing emphasis upon any 
one single factor; but that struggle 
must be made in every line of en- 
deavor. Other phases of the problem 
discussed in this article are: lynching 
and the Dyer Anti-lynching Bill, em- 
ployment, segregation, the sex factor 
in race relations, disfranchisement and 
education. 

The Literary Digest for August 27 
gives a brief history of Liberia under 
the title, “Where the Negro Rules”. 

The American Mercury for Sep- 
tember carries a brief and exception- 
ally unprejudiced account of the Ne- 
gro in the United States under the 
title, “Life, Death and the Negro” by 
Louis I. Dublin. From the landing 
of a boatload of slaves at Jamestown 
in 1619, Mr. Dublin tells the story 
of the Negro in America down to the 
present time and draws his deductions 
concerning him from authentic statis- 
tics. We disagree with him, however, 
when he says that the Negro death rate 
is increasing. Facts brought out dur- 
ing the meeting of the Pan-African 
Congress proved beyond any shadow 
of doubt that the death rate is declin- 
ing with an amazing degree of rapid- 
ity. In conclusion Mr. Dublin says 
of the Negro: “He is here for good 
and the years to come ‘will probably 
see him playing an increasingly im-

portant and worthy part in the affairs 
of the country. His. achievement in 
America will be ultimately recognized, 
not only as the greatest experiment 
in racial adjustment ever undertaken 
by man, but as the most encouraging 
and gratifying episode in our national 
life’. 

During the past two years, diverse 
and glowing tributes have been paid 
the favored child in the literary firma- 
ment—the Negro in Art. There have 
been those of us who have fattened 
on this pampering and _ contentedly 
broken three or four waist-coat but- 
tons. But there have also been those 
of us who have been waiting impa- 
tiently for an intelligent weeding out 
of the bad from the good; for we 
know certainly that some mud has been 
mistaken for gold. That time, it 
seems, is at hand—that time when we 
must step aside and view with unsenti- 
mental perspective the work that has 
been done in this excited period of ar- 
tistic effort. 

Wallace Thurman attempts tome- 
thing of the sort in his article, “Negro 
Artists and the Negro”, which appears 
in the New Republic for August 31. 
He proves himself an iconoclastic cri- 
tic with a sense of discernment; but 
occasionally truth is overshadowed by 
personal bias. Somehow we believe 
that Negro writers, in order to invest 
their literature with simplicity and 
sincerity and beauty, must look for 
material within their own personal ex- 
perience, regardless of time and place. 
That the “renaissance” has not birthed 
something fine about a certain sort of 
Negro is not proof enough that it can 
not be done. On the whole, however, 
the article is well written and worth 
reading.

A hampooing is the_most 
important part of caring for the hair ~ 


‘Wuetuer done at home or in the beauty shoppe, proper shampooing is the first

the real life and natural lustre of the hair.

have to if your hairdresser is a Madam C. J. Walker agent. Madam C. J. Walker 
agents everywhere using Madam C. J. Walker’s Vegetable Shampoo Soap are 
specially trained to give you a good, better shampoo, and they doit. As they give 
it, the shampoo is a softening, cleaning operation, an enlivening, invigorating treat- 
ment, a perfect joy to receive.

If some circumstance compels you to shampoo your ‘ge 
own hair, use only Madam C. J. Walker's Vegetable

medicated lather that cleans, sweetens and purifies 
the scalp. It is positively one of the finest shampoos 
on the market. :
