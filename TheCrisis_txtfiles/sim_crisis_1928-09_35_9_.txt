Another Progressive Step 
of the 


Southern Aid Society 
of Va., Inc. 


Gratifying reports of improvement in the health and mortality ratings of 
colored people are frequently noted in the press, but seldom, if ever, is there 
any credit given the Negro Fraternals, Industrial Sick Benefit, Industrial Life 
and Ordinary Life Insurance Companies for this commendable race progress. 











These race institutions by providing during periods of illness or other dis- 
ability, weekly cash benefits, and by paying promptly death claims following 
the death of policyholders, and by giving healthful and gainful employment 
to thousands of colored men and women, have been potent factors in lowering 
the sick and death rates of the race. In fact, they have made it possible for 
the humblest as well as the more fortunate homes to have proper medical at- 
tention, hospital service when needed, proper food and care during periods of 
illness and disability, thereby materially reducing the periods and frequency of 
illness and disability and consequently prolonging the lives of thousands of race 
people. Then, too, the better incomes provided by the employment offered by 
these institutions have contributed much to the improvement of the home life, 
health and well-being of the colored people. 























The Southern Aid Society of Virginia, Inc., was among the pioneers in these 
health conservation measures, and is pleased to announce that on account of the 
improvement in the health and mortality status of the race, it will issue, begin- 
ning July 2, 1928, a more liberal Policy Contract, providing, for One Small 
Premium, protection against Sickness, Accident and Death.

* (These men had their first insurance experience with this Company, and have been in 
the business less than two years.) 


To qualify for membership in the Victors’ Club an agent of this Company has to secure at 
least $100,000.00 of insurance within the year on the annual premium basis—semi-annual 
and quarterly premiums reduce the credit proportionately. 


The second week in August at the Annual Home-Coming of our agents, these men were 
the guests of the Company with full expenses to Chicago and return, with all the resources of 
Chicago at their disposal for a well earned vacation. 


Some idea of the real public appreciation of the Victory Life policy may be had from the 
fact that new men without life insurance experience joined our organization and made the 
Victors’ Club their first year. 


“1929 VICTORS’ CLUB NOW FORMING” 


If you want the opportunity to make money with an organization that doesn’t mind 
being proud of you, make your reservation for the 1929 Victors’ Club now. We are not par- 
ticular about agents of other companies. New men without previous experience, provided 
they have a high school education or better, do just as well. A square peg, tired of a round 
hole, may find every facility for adjustment and increased earnings with this organization.

This is a step in the right direction. 
Often in the past, nations have fought 
when they didn’t want to.—The grief 
in the United States over the assassina- 
tion of Obregon is tempered by the 
fear that this, after all, may not throw 
Mexico into such confusion that the 
National City Bank can interfere. Of 
course, there is still hope——The battle 
of Italy and Russia at the North Pole 
seems to have put the Facisti at a dis- 
tinct disadvantage as compared with 
the Soviets—And China too is again 
disappointing the white folks. Why 
can’t it keep on fighting instead of 
settling down under a Nationalist gov- 
ernment and bringing up that tiresome 
question of treaties ?—Coolidge has ex- 
plained the Civil War and slavery. It 
was nobody’s fault. It was just “in- 
evitable”. What a comforting thought 
for fools and cowards today.—When 
a champion boxing pug retires with 
a million what is more fitting than a 
course in philosophy at the Sorbonne?

N the presidential campaign just be- 
| ginning one question transcends all 
others. ‘This question which tran- 
scends, in its importance and imme- 
diacy, the questions of farm relief, 
flood control, national control of super- 
power, liquor and the tariff, is the 
question as to how far the policies of 
this government are going to be con- 
trolled by the vote of its citizens. 

In other words, we cannot take up 
the various pressing questions con- 
fronting us until we settle this matter 
of ultimate democratic control. De- 
spite tradition and assumption, this 
question is not settled. The propor- 
tion of actual voters among the voting 
population of the United States is be- 
tween twenty-five and thirty-three per 
cent out of sixty million citizens 
twenty-one years of age and over. 

The loss of interest in voting or the 
prevention by various means and 
methods of allowing citizens to exer- 
cise the right to vote, is a national 
phenomenon. Nowhere in the United 
States is there a voting population of 
seventy per cent of those qualified as in 
Eastern Canada, or seventy to eighty 
per cent as in France, Belgium, Hol- 
land, Germany and Switzerland. We 
do not even reach the ‘sixty-four per 
cent of Italy and South America and, 
of course, the eighty or ninety per cent 
of Australia is apparently beyond our 
dreams. 


R, to put it another way; in 1920 

we had both a presidential elec- 
tion and a decennial census; so that 
for the first time in twenty years we 
knew the population at the time of an 
election. In that election, the follow- 
ing percentage of citizens twenty-one 
years of age and over did not vote in 
the several states:

The Possibility of Democracy in America

This article was originally prepared 


for the Stock-Taking and Fact-Find-

North Carolina, in December, 1927. 
With some additions and revisions it 
was delivered again before the open- 
ing meeting of the 19th Annual N. A. 
A.C. P. Conference at Los Angeles in 
June, 1928. It appears in print for 
the first time and will be published in

South. Over one-half the adults of 
Pennsylvania, Vermont, Maine and 
California stayed from the poles and 
nearly one-half the voting population 
of Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, 
Wisconsin, Oregon, Massachusetts, 
Wyoming, Nebraska and Michigan. 
In only one state in the United States 
did three-fourths of the voters go to 
the poles and in only eight states did 
two-thirds go. 

This is a serious thing. The theory 
of democracy does not call for equality 
of gift, universal college education or 
absolute individual integrity; but it 
does depend upon the widest possible 
consultation with the mass of citizens 
on the theory that only in this way can 
you consult ultimate authority and 
ultimate sovereignty. This theory may 
be wrong. Possibly the United States 
is ready to adopt a restricted ballot 
and base sovereignty upon an elec- 
torate limited by education, occupa- 
tion, ability, birth, wealth, race, or 
some combination of these factors. 
Possibly we are ready for Italian syndi- 
calistic oligarchy or Spanish dictator- 
ship. But if this is true we must face 
the change frankly and adopt it logi- 
cally. We must not drift further as 
we are doing. For a generation the 
possibility of any rational consultation 
of the public will in this country has 
been fading. 


ODAY, the difference in the rela- 
tive political power of the various 
states and groups of states is so enor- 
mous in the United States that no 
American has any right to sneer at Old 
Sarum or at the conditions that 
brought the first English Reform Bill. 
This can be illustrated by a table 
which shows the number of votes cast 
in the various states for the election 
of each of that state’s representatives 
in Congress: ’ ; 
The stranger from Mars looking at 
this table would immediately ask:

South Carolina should have eleven 
times as much political power as the 
citizens of New Mexico?” Or: “How 
can a voter in Massachusetts have 
fifty per cent more power than the 
voter in Indiana?” 

If we group the states geographi- 
cally we find that in 1920 the Pacific 
and Northwestern States cast 1,945,- 
504 votes for 24 representatives in 
Congress, or 81,067 votes per con- 
gressman. The Middle West States 
cast 10,088,606 votes for 127 repre- 
senatives, or 79,439 votes per repre- 
sentative. The Border States cast 
4,194,509 votes for 58 representatives, 
or 72,319 votes per representative. The 
Southwest States cast 636,893 votes 
tor 9 representatives, or 70,766 votes 
per representative. The Middle At- 
lantic States cast 5,649,216 votes for 
91 representatives or 61,079 votes per 
representative. The New England 
States cast 967,711 votes for 32 repre- 
sentatives, or 61,492 votes per repre- 
sentative. Contrast this with the 
South, which cast only 2,175,007 votes 
and yet with them elected 94 repre- 
sentatives, or only 23,138 votes per 
representative. 

Or put it another way, a million 
voters elect: 

On the Pacific Coast—12 Congress- 
men. 

In the Middle West—13 Congress- 
men. 

In New England—16 Congressmen. 

In the South—45 Congressmen. 


EW England has an enormous ad- 
vantage over the Northwest and 
considerable over the Middle West, 
while the political advantage of the 
South is so extraordinary as to force 
consideration of its peculiar situation. 
When one gets thus far in the argu- 
ment, there arises in the mind of the 
average American reader the fact that 
the whole argument involves, at least

in large part, the South; and brings 
back the almost forgotten question of 
Negro suffrage. This is true; but the 
object of this paper is to impress the 
fact that the question at issue is much 
larger than this and that no matter 
what the discussion involves, it must 
be discussed, or else democratic govern- 
ment in the United States is impossible. 

Senator Swanson of Virginia has 
just said in the Senate: 

“The South has exercised her con- 
stitutional rights to eliminate a class of 
ignorant, shiftless and corrupt voters.” 
Other states like Massachusetts have 
disfranchised the illiterate and, of 
course, the un-naturalized foreigners. 

There is no doubt that any modern 
democratic community faced by a large 
amount of ignorance, unusual poverty 
and political corruption must in some 
way defend itself. In the defense 
which the South attempted to make 
against ignorance, poverty and corrup- 
tion, she had the moral support of the 
majority of citizens of the United 
States. But it is over a half century 
since the 15th Amendment was pro- 
claimed and a full generation since the 
new Southern disfranchisement was be- 
gun. At that time to disfranchise the 
poor and ignorant automatically ex- 
cluded the great mass of the black men 
from the ballot. Today, a large num- 
ber is still poor and illiterate. But 
today it is also true that large num- 
bers of black men are disfranchised not 
because of ignorance or thriftlessness 
but simply and frankly because they 
are black. A critical time of considera- 
tion is approaching. Any day a case 
like the Texas primary may appear in 
the Supreme Court which will gravely 
challenge present methods and it is 
doubtful if any mere appeal to mob 
law against any such decision will be 
tolerated even in the South. Surely 
then the time has come for a careful, 
dispassionate consideration—not so 
much of the political condition of the 
South as of the effect which the politi- 
cal legislation of the South from 1890 
to 1909 has had upon the politics of 
the nation. 


IRST and foremost, it is necessary 
for the nation to ask the Southern 
States what it is they wish today to 
disfranchise—race or condition? If 
the first is what they propose, that 
is illegal and can only be done by con- 


stitutional amendment. There may be 
reasons which appeal to Americans 
why disfranchisement by race is de- 
sirable. 
be inaugurated. 

There has been a demand for this 
from a few persons North and South. 
But the reason that such a campaign 
has not been seriously suggested, is, of 
course, clear: the nation would logi- 


296 


If so, such a campaign should 


cally demand first and foremost that 
if Negroes as such, are legally excluded 
from the right of suffrage, they should 
not be counted as a basis of repre- 
sentation either in Congress or the 
state legislatures. In the founding of 
the American republic, New England 
demanded that representation in Con- 
gress be based on the free population. 
Its stand was logically impregnable, 
and the only real, albeit unspoken 
argument that led to compromise, was 
the feeling that eventually the slave 
population was going to disappear, 
either by emancipation into freedom or 
by deportation. Until this time, slaves 
were to count two-fifths of the white 
population in determining representa- 
tion. 

With the 13th Amendment, Ne- 
groes, although still economically en- 
slaved, counted as five-fifths. With 
the new disfranchising laws, they still 
count just as fully as the white popu- 
lation. But this again was permitted 
on the tacit assumption that these laws 
were temporary in their application— 
that when the freedmen learned to read 
and write, accumulated property and 
established a modern, cultural life, 
they would be allowed to vote on the 
same terms as other Americans. Not 
only was this a former assumption of 
the North—it was the plain state- 
ment and repeated promise of the 


South. 


T is, then, but reasonable that if 
the South wishes now to change 
the constitution and laws of the United 
States and make it possible to exclude 
men from voting 9n account of race 
and color—that the test of its sincerity 
is its willingness in that case not to 
count the colored population as a basis 
for representation. 

If on the other hand the South 
merely wishes to get rid of an elec- 
torate too ignorant, too poverty 
stricken and corrupt to vote honestly, 
it has already a multiplicity of laws on 
the subject. But laws of this sort 
ought so to be drawn and administered 
as to encourage education and thrift 
and honesty and their proper test is 
the gradual disappearance of illiteracy 
and the gradual enfranchisement of 
Negroes, otherwise, they are ineffective 
and dangerous. 

As a matter of fact, just whom does 
the South disfranchise? It is difficult 
to get an official record of voting in 
the United States and especially diffi- 
cult in the South with regard to the 
voting of Negroes. 

In Louisiana the state furnishes a 
fairly accurate official record. In the 
election for President in 1924, there 
were 274,592 white persons registered 
and 980 Negroes. The white popu- 
lation of the state in 1920 was 1,096,- 


611; the Negro popuiation was /()().. 
257. Of these, 564,933 whites were 
21 years of age and over, and 359,25) 
Negroes. Of the adult Negroes 229. 
980 were reported as illiterate. The 
leaves 129,271 who can read and write. 
The statistics of illiteracy are inaccy- 
rate. Still, it would seem reasonable 
to suppose that at least 100,000 Lou- 
isiana Negroes were men of average 
intelligence, able to read and write. 
Nearly eighty percent of the Negro 
population, 10 years of age and over, 
is engaged in gainful occupations, and 
includes 164,109 farmers, 52,687 in 
manufacturing and mechanical indus- 
tries, 21,802 working in transporta- 
tion, 6,700 engaged in trade, 1,983 in 
the public service, 3,385 in professional 
service, 1,308 clerks and 54,370 ser- 
vants. Moreover, among the Negroe; 
there were more than 10,000 person; 
who owned their farms, and in add) 
tion to these farmers, 28,906 Negroe 
owned their homes. The total prop 
erty owned by Negroes of Louisiana i 


_not actually known but judging from 


Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina, 
where records are kept, it cannot be 


less than $75,000,000. 


ET out of all these people, only 

980 were allowed to register and 
vote and the number of Negro reg- 
istered voters has decreased almost by 
half in the last 16 years, as there were 
1,743 registered in 1908. Manifestly 
Louisiana is disfranchising mainly by 
race and not simply for illiteracy or 
shiftlessness. 

In Alabama, there were reported 
269,847 Negroes 21 years of age and 
over who could read and write in 
1920. Careful inquiry shows that 
“there are not more than 3,500 Ne- 
groes voting in the state of Alabama 
and less than 1,000 in the city of 
Birmingham”. 

In Macon County, for instance, 
where Tuskegee Institute is situated, 
there are 4,927 Negroes 21 years of 
age and over who can read and write, 
and of these 22 are registered voters. 

In Montgomery County, containing 
the capital of the state, out of 13,973 
literate Negroes, 21 years of age and 
over, 41 are registered. 

In Mobile County, out of 17,375 
literate Negroes 21 years of age and 
over, 958 are registered. 

In the city of Birmingham, among 
the most progressive of the industrial- 
ized Negro group, out of 33,655 Ne- 
groes 21 years of age and over, who 
can read and write, less than 1,000 are 
registered voters. . 


N Mississippi, according to a cafe- 
ful inquiry made in 1927, there are 
at present 850 Negroes registered, out

HEN Richard Cutney had 
W bought the Parmley place Tom 
ad been among the “appurtenances 
thereof”. With a passive dignity 
strange in a Negro under thirty, he 
had greeted his new master and his 
young wife. Cutney, forty, a country 
editor for years with a propensity for 
chivalrous and humanitarian verse, had 
played with lines for a more splendid 
“Man with the Hoe” ever since his 
frst view of Tom. The tall broad 
muscular body of the Negro, tapering 
into a small compact black skull whose 
covering of hair seemed, at a distance, 
carved out of the same hard material ; 
the grace of the man in motion or in 
repose; his delight in sounds, colors, 
textures; above all, his animal, intelli- 
gent, comprehending eyes. All these 
made Cutney feel his own pallor more, 
ashamed of his face that showed red 
blotches and smarted after shaving, 
conscious of his preposterous body as 
it idled comically in the bath-tub. But 
he was humanitarian and did not hold 
the contrast against the man; quite 
apart from petty afflictions of the nose 
and throat and skin, there was the 
manifest Caucasian superiority of mind. 
Between tedious reports of county 
board proceedings, long lists of per- 
sonals, innocuous editorials on the 
weather and such matters, initialled 
poems on woman—spring—faith—hope 
—or charity, the pale Cutney found 
time to develop a new theory of the 
sundering of the species wherein the 
superman, carrying a colossal head up- 
on a puny body equipped with spindly 
legs, directed from his perch a swarm 
of toiling Hercules. After which com- 
forting vision, the editor might take 
his pill to counteract the hyperacidity 
of his stomach. 


UT Cutney did not always build 

defenses. His was too kindly a 
nature. There were glamorous south- 
ern nights, heavy with the smell of 
earth and growing things yet febrile 
with staccato insect noises, when the 
editor and Marion, his wife, sat on the 
veranda and listened with pleasure to 
the singing of the Negro. Tom sat 
on the back steps, his throat in a mel- 
low, husky, restless activity. The col- 
ored maid, Genevieve, leaned in the 
doorway, sometimes adding a shrill ac- 
companiment off-key. The night was 
4 warm and glowing spray, slowly 
Penetrating to the deeply hidden dis- 
quietudes of the soul. Her face a glis-

No White Woman 


A Story 
By A. L. SHANDS 


tening black, Genevieve held large 
knotted hands to her swelling breasts. 
On the front porch the slender 
Marion’s tongue moistened her lips, 
while one clammy palm nursed a 
tightening fist. Cutney puffed on a 
long thin black cigar. His tongue 
fondled the prettiness of a worn-out 
poesy. Tom’s body leaned forward, 
while his hands played idly but rhyth- 
mically with a piece of string. His 
eves now gazed gently on the bits 
of glass that studded-a velvet sky, and 
then on the blue of the stirring earth. 
Four bodies gathered here had some- 
how lost their workaday habiliments. 
Tom, only, wore his nakedness with 
candor, without the squeamishess that 
expressed itself in involuntary stirrings, 
in words that carelessly glossed over a 
troubling murmur. 

Cutney considered his wife, hastily 
telescoping an uninteresting chronology 
to its immediate cross-section. Her 
twenty-five years of careful breeding 
and their successful efflorescence in 
marriage occupied him for a moment; 
they were proper. And, now, this en- 
raptured bit of color needed placing 
in that scheme: her moist, excited ab- 
sorption in Tom’s singing as its words 
slurred and circled faintly around the 
heuse into a drowsy insignificance. 
‘That, too, was as it should be. “Wo- 
man and song”. His mind doted on 
such correlatives, although this par- 
ticular pair he squeezed of its bawdy 
juices and hung upon his poetic line to 
dry. Cutney—it is a clue to the date 
of his chivalric attitude—never, in his 
distorted Neitzscheanism, contem- 
plated the possibility of the large- 
headed, spindle-legged female. Prob- 
ably his Darwinism was as weak as 
his metric structures. Anyhow, his 
philosophy dealt with a reproduction 
of kind only in a foot-note, carefully 
edited. A celibacy of forty years had 
quite slaked him of youthful obsessions 
on that subject. Now, he was married 
two whole years and had not been 
shocked either into disgust or discovery. 


N the spell of certain sounds Marion 

would clutch his hand, fold and un- 
told his fingers. She would catch her 
breath, audibly, during a melancholy 
baying at the moon. These reactions 
were explicable to Cutney on the 
grounds that she was a woman and that 
she was young. He could not compare 
her with the moon-struck Genevieve, 
who, though young and a woman, had 
not that civilized appreciation for the 
cool maturity that was his main pride 


and asset. No, appreciation was not 
the word—for Genevieve, robust and 
sweating, had often stammered ques- 
tions for his wisdom to unravel. The 
point was that Marion loved him for 
that same worldly (‘old world”, he 
called it) tolerance and air. Gene- 
vieve had large bewildered eyes—and a 
squat figure that never found repose 
im an acutely angular universe. Yet 
she had, too, a mind (Cutney had al- 
leged), a child’s mind that wanted to 
know why. The master, who was a 
benevolent despot without the will or 
strength of tyranny, loaned her books 
which she invariably left unread, and 
even was inclined to chide her, with 
a bespectacled and kindly humor, for 
loving Tom who showed no intellectual 
curiosity. Cutney had never under- 
stood her defense that Tom really 
knew. 

“He answers my questions—but he 
don’ talk,”’ she had said. 


Cutney had repeated that crypticism, 
which he considered a choice morsel of 
illiteracy, to Marion. She mused for a 
while, and then nodded in a slow af- 
firmative: 

“She loves him.” 

Which proved, for the mth time to 
Cutney, that love was blind and wo- 
men were funny. In his poems he 


called one divine and the other enig- 
matic. 


SMALL town is a better place 
A than a city for the almost his- 
tological study of character. Even gos- 
sip may be charitably construed as 
erroneously focussed microscopic glimp- 
ses of sections of a man’s character. 
In a household, especially one that is 
fairly isolated because of the asocial 
instincts of its master, the opportunities 
for such study become pressing neces- 
sities. Even the dullest mind will be 
goaded into habits of close scrutiny and 
even generalization by repeated con- 
tacts with inexplicable and somehow 
tantalizing specimens of humanity. 
Perhaps Cutney thought too much 
about Tom and his significance, 
thought of the matter to the point of 
morbidity. (But not beyond because 
the editor was sane, within non-Freud- 
ian limits.) How could he help it? 
The self-possession of the Negro was 
gigantic. He did not shamble, he did 
not bow, he did not flunky. Of course, 
Cutney was democratic; but here there 
was no opportunity for the assertion of 
such an attitude. The man, in fact— 
and here was the rub—towered over

his master. He was called in to make 
repairs at which Cutney was so inept. 
He stood, smiling and bareheaded, in 
the hot sun, while Cutney squirmed 
and wilted. He accepted rain and 
storm, and every kind of weather, with 
equal and untarnished equanimity, 
while each brought new and ever-un- 
solved problems to his master. He 
spoke little and his face was calm; yet 
no malicious stretching of the imagina- 
tion could label him an imbecile. Nor 
was he apathetic. He trimmed lawns 
and hedges with an eye for beauty; he 
re-painted the house more than ade- 
quately. He held warm, busy little 
chicks in the palm of his hand and 
showed delight. Once Cutney had 
found him running the shining patent 
leather of a new pair of pearl-buttoned 
shoes against his cheek. The editor’s 
scarcely veiled contempt was inapro- 
pos; and the editor felt without admit- 
ting it. 


HE unhealthy verdigris of his 
twisted envy became somehow 
ciassified with his dyspeptic symptoms. 
But it got less sympathy. There, for in- 
stance, was the annoying and idoitic 
adulation that sweated from every pore 
of the awkward Genevieve. No doubt 
she cooked choice foods for Tom. Their 
silence for hours in the back of the 
house augmented Cutney’s bitterness. 
That sort of thing couldn’t go on in 
his house—but what to do, what to say, 
without being ridiculous? He thought 
of irate and door-swinging exposures 
of the sinning pair—but the possible 
silliness of thus exposing a romantic 
innocence restrained him. And then 
there was his wife, who—he knew— 
knew not of such irregularities. 

One Sunday his after-dinner stroll 
brought him to the bank of a quietly 
meandering stream and, in it, moving 
lazily and silently like a great black 
fish, was Tom. ‘The hackneyed poetic 
allusions that such a stroll always 
stimulated suddenly Jost all their flavor, 
point and piquancy. He watched long 
glistening arms cut the water noise- 
lessly, rhythmically. ‘Tom’s eyes were 
closed; the languid curvings of his 
form were like movements in some 
studied ritual. The alternate shine of 
his body as it appeared above the sur- 
face and the dark blot it made below 
were the light and shade, the rise and 
tall of the curious ceremony . . . Tom 
dragged his body to the opposite bank 
and walked about—a polished giant 
with his compact head held high. He 
stretched his arms in a gesture of em- 
brace; and, finally, lay naked, gleam- 
ing wet, upon the grass. Cutney’s 
walk was spoiled ; his middle-aged lyri- 
cism soured. Oh, he supposed, there 
was physical love, it being nature’s 
method and all that. Really, Gene- 
vieve and Tom ought to marry. Cut- 


298 


ney would have no objection so long 
as they both stayed. He saw himself 
giving counsel to the wedded pair; he 
saw Tom’s cool, intelligent, devastat- 
ing eyes—oh, damn the man! 

A corner of his mind was conscious 
of the absurdity of his situation: al- 
ways seeking to pick flaws in a young 
Negro. That consciousness kept him 
from finding an outlet for his dissatis- 
faction in his wife who was usually so 
excellent a listener. The necessity for 
justification grew upon him, so that his 
editorials soon showed an incipient new 
animus. 


NE night that it rained Cutney 

congratulated himself on his si- 
lence. It became plain that Marion ad- 
mired the Negro, enjoyed the elemental 
quality of his singing much. She had in- 
vited Tom that night into the sitting- 
room—to sing. Astonished, Cutney had 
acquiesced in her request to do this. 
He was not sorry—for, somehow, he 
triumphed over the tenseness that grew 
with the evening. Between songs 
Tom’s eyes, seeking rest, had flitted 
from every daintiness to every rigidity 
of the room’s furnishings until they 
grew confused. Marion began to 
flush with sympathy for the man’s 
agony. And Cutney sat, smiling gently, 
stroking his chin like a wise patriarch. 
In this room and on this occasion his 
superior dignity was manifest. In his 
elation he, mentally, drew away and 
left the Negro and his wife together 
and alone. ... It was Cutney who 
finally proposed adjournment; Marion 
led Tom to the door—too quickly for 
Cutney who had primed himself for 
the delivery of an ambiguous congratu- 
lation to Tom. His thoughts were 
pleasant, however, and he treasured 
them for use in a contemplated article 
on “Aspects of Negro Music”. His 
technical ignorance did not trouble 
him. While working on a first and 
very unsatisfactory draft the irrelevant 
memory came to him that Tom had 
been wearing an old shirt of his own 
that night. That collar must have 
been tight. The editor felt his throat 
for a moment and thought of the word 
“delicacy” which later he incorporated 
into his essay in a disparaging comment 
on his subject. 

Before leaving for the three-day 
convention of country editors and pub- 
lishers in Washington, Cutney broached 
the matter of her future to Gene- 
vieve. He achieved a feeling of gentle 
exaltation as he passed platitudinous 
judgments on life and love and relevant 
topics. He spoke with feeling on the 
disadvantages of “keeping company” 
too long. 

“I’d marry Tom any day,” Gene- 
vieve said. “Only he ain’t ready yet.” 

She was sad, and her eyes rolled in a 
sudden upheaval of melancholy. 





“You might speak to Tom,” she 
suggested hesitantly, 
UTNEY promised but postponed 
execution until his return from 
the convention. Instead, he spoke to 
his wife. She urged him, with feryor 
to keep out of the affair. . 

“Anyhow, I think he’s too good for 
her,” she said. 

Cutney protested, adducing the 
maid’s domesticity, stolidity. Marion, 
pressed for reasons, could only stam. 
mer finally: “Well, I don’t care one 
way or the other.” 

Thus the matter rested. Cutney 
proceeded to Washington where he 
swelled up agreeably before declama- 
tions on his duty to the nation and the 
nation’s dependence on him. He re- 
turned from that warm and billowy at- 
mosphere to encounter the cold and 
jagged edges of an unrelieved disaster, 

The train brought him to town 
shortly after ten o’clock that morning, 
His telephone was ringing as he en- 
tered his office. It was Genevieve— 
incoherent, wildly excited. 

Tom was gone, he learned ,—disap- 
peared. Marion was in bed, hysterical. 
Something terrible had happened, and 
it wasn’t Tom’s fault, the maid in- 
sisted. That was all Cutney could 
make of her incoherence, outside of the 
fact that he was wanted—and a doctor. 

He called for Dr. Prennel on the 
way, and they drove to Cutney’s home. 
Both went immediately to Marion's 
room, followed by a gesticulating maid, 
moaning, babbling of a vanished Tom. 
The doctor took one hasty glance at 
the patient and gently shoved the other 
two out of the room. 

“You'll have to leave us alone for a 
while,” he said. 


UTNEY had seen a pale moist face 

and wide staring eyes; a slight 
murmur had come from the drivelling 
mouth. He and Genevieve stood in 
the hall for a while, Cutney bare- 
headed, hat in hand, still in a daze. 

“Where’s Tom?” he asked. 

“T dunno,” she wailed. ‘“He’s run 
away—I dunno where. It’s her fault 
—all her—” 

“What’s her fault—what did she 
do?” 

“She brought ’im in las’ night—to 
sing. You know, like las’ time—” 

“Well, what of it—didn’t he want 
to sing? What happened 2” 

“She done it. She made ’im—” 

Prennel opened the door of the bed- 
room. 

“Come in, Cutney,” he called. 

“She’s unconscious now,” he began, 
after he had closed the door behind 
the husband. “I had to give her an 
opiate. She needs rest—too nervous, 
pretty far gone, in fact.”

Monroe N. Work, 4 Bibliography of 
the Negro in Africa and America. 
The H. W. Wilson Company, New 
York. 


HIS monumental work of 698 
7 large octavo pages is the most 
complete bibliography on the Negro 
published. Mr. Work, for many years 
head of the Department of Records 
and Research at Tuskegee Institute, 
has been helped in his compilation by 
a grant of the Carnegie Corporation 
of New York and the Phelps-Stokes 
Fund. The result is a list of nearly 
40,000 books, pamphlets and maga- 
zine articles on the Negro in America 
and in Africa. The casual reader can 
not, of course, determine its complete- 
ness and accuracy, but what few tests 
we have applied sustain the apparent 
thoroughness of the work. Some flaws 
are evident. For instance: it would 
have helped reference to have varied 
the page headings; one wonders why 
White’s translation of Felix Dubois’ 
“Timbuktu the Mysterious” was not 
noted or what led to the omission of 
Chesnutt’s biography of Frederick 
Douglass; and, by the way, Chesnutt’s 
name is misspelled; “José Clarana’” is 
only a pseudonym for Jaime Gil. 

There are doubtless numbers of 
such minor mistakes; but there can be 
no doubt but that the whole work is a 
gigantic and worthy accomplishment 
and will long be a guide to literature 
on the Negro.

IN THE MAGAZINES 
ie May the colored students of the 

University of Cincinnati issued the 
first number of The New Horizon. 
The contributions to the two numbers 
we have examined are, for the most 
part, amateurish, but here and there 
are promising bits. This marks a de- 
parture from the tradition of Negroes 
in northern institutions, where, ex- 
cept in too few instances when they 
have contributed to white student pub- 
lications, they have been inarticulate. 
We shall watch The New Horizon 
with interest. 

The Nation for April 18 carries 
“Beauty Instead of Ashes” in which 
Alain Locke discusses the present trend 
of the Negro in art. Dr. Locke says 
that the younger Negro school has em- 
phasized three things: realistic fiction, 
folk plays and type analysis; and that 
instead of becoming sullen under pov- 
erty and oppression, the Negro is creat- 
ing “beauty out of the ashes”. 

International Review of Missions 
for July carries an article on “Biology 
and African Education” by S. A. 
Hammond. Mr. Hammond, who has 
been engaged in school work in Africa 
for many years, says that Africa needs 
a definite aim expressed in terms of 
school practice. Practical work and 
scientific technique, he says, are in- 
complete without the knowledge of 
life; and in order to give the African 
a firm foundation for higher education, 
he must be taught that life and the cul- 
tural branches of learning have a defi- 
nite correlation. 

In the same issue of International 
Review of Missions Sister M. C. Mag- 
dalen discusses the “Education of Girls 
in Southern Nigeria”. Until recently 





education of native girls has been neg- 
lected, but it is now being taken up 
with enthusiasm. Sister Magdalen 
says that the big work before educators 
in Africa is to build up a system of 
education for youth and to prepare 
teachers who will evolve an African 
system of education. The article is 
loaded with patronizing good will, the 
spirit of uplift and sentimentality. 

William Beebe in the Af?lantic 
Monthly for July takes us to the 
rugged shore of Haiti to visit “The 
Fiddlers by the Sea”. Mr. Beebe has 
interwoven his story of the fiddler 
crabs with descriptions of the magic 
coral sea and colorful pictures of 
mahogany-hued natives. 

W. Sherman Savage in The W, rld 
Tomorrow for July gives us a 1ew 
interpretation of ‘The Fourtee ith 
Amendment”. At the time the Amead- 
ment was under consideration, indi- 
viduals and joint-stock companies were 
appealing to Congress for protection 
against local and state taxes. There- 
fore the framers of the Amendment 
hoped, by writing it in indefinite lan- 
guage, to protect not only the rights 
of the Negro, but to protect all indi- 
viduals and joint-stock companies who 
were seeking relief. Thus, since its 
inception in 1868, the Fourteenth 
Amendment has shifted its application 
and has become, for the most part, the 
“good angel” to corporations in their 
fight against State control. 

In the same issue of The World 
Tomorrow Lorine Pruette discusses 
the fallacy of “The Instinct of Race 
Prejudice”. Race prejudice, says Miss 
Pruette, is a nurtured thing—a fragile 
plant coaxed to hardy maturity. “John- 
nie!” Fond mamma calls small son in 
from play. “You cannot play with 
Tommie. He’s a nigger!” Johnnie 
hears this today — tomorrow — next 
week. He learns his lesson well. It 
is as natural for him to shun Tommie 
as to go to sleep when he is tired. And 
when he becomes articulate, he says 
that race prejudice is instinctive! 

In an article surfeited with snap 
judgments, Wallace Thurman reviews 
“Negro Poets and Their Poetrv” in 
The Bookman for July. Mr. Thur- 
man discusses a handful of pnets, 
among them, Phillis Wheatlev. Paul 
Laurence Dunbar, James Weldon 
Johnson, Claude McKay. Countée Cul- 
len and Langston Hughes. and dis- 
misses them all with a wide gesture.

301 



























































































































WANT to congratulate you upon 

the fine educational number of THE 
Crisis which I have just opened. It is 
the best yet. 


Gerorce W. CRAWFORD, 
New Haven, Conn. 


You may or may not remember the 
call I made on you in your office last 
January or February on my way home 
from Boston. It was a very pleasant 
call, to me at any rate, and | have 
some hope that it left that impression 
on you, so that you will be pleased 
to know that I want to congratulate 
you on the current number of THE 
Urisis both for the solid statistical mat- 
ter it contains and the summary state- 
ments of fact as to various institu- 
tions. 


The points made in the Battle 
Front are well sharpened and the 
Poet’s Corner strikes me as above the 
average; but I won’t say much for I 
am so much interested in my friends in 
Haiti that if I began to talk I couldn’t 
stay in a corner. 


I have long felt moved in spirit to 
write and complain about the charac- 
ter of the illustrations your paper gen- 
erally carries for cover ornamentation. 
The nude done with soft and flowing 
lines is objectionable enough in such 
cases, but drawn in cubist or semi- 
cubist style is unendurable; and drawn, 
and re-drawn and perpetually drawn 
and shoved under one’s nose runs what 
was bad style in the first place into a 
nuisance. But I am relieved of mak- 
ing any criticism in the matter by the 
article of Allison.Davis on Negro “In- 
tellectuals” as I think it’s fine from 
beginning to end, largely because he 
says the things I think and believe so 
much better than I could have said 
them. I am very glad you published 
it and hope all your readers will read 
it two or three times over; and that 
the authors he refers to and the artists 
I have referred to will also read and 
profit by it. 


Haroip Goopwin, 
Philadelphia. 


Mr. Allison Davis, in his recent 
article, Our Negro “Intellectuals”, 
makes the following assertion: 

“T think that the severest charge one 
can make against Mr. Van Vechten 


302 


is that he misdirected a genuine poet, 
who gave promise of a power and tech- 
nique exceptional in any poetry,—Mr. 
Hughes .... in Fine Clothes to the 
Jew, which Mr. Van Vechten un- 
doubtedly did influence, is the real 
proof of his having finally misdirected 
Mr. Hughes.” 


This, to all my available knowl- 
edge on the subject, is quite untrue. 
I do not know what facts Mr. Davis 
himself may possess as to how, where, 
or when I have been misdirected by 
Mr. Van Vechten, but since I happen 
to be the person who wrote the mate- 
rial comprising Fine Clothes to the 
Jew, I would like herewith to state 
and declare that many of the poems in 
said book were written before I made 
the acquaintance of Mr. Van Vechten, 
as the files of THE Crisis will prove; 
before the appearance of The Weary 
Blues containing his preface; and be- 
fore ever he had commented in any way 
on my work. (See THe Crisis for 
June, 1922, August, 1923, several is- 
sues in 1925; also the Buccaneer for 
May, 1925.) Those poems which 
were written after my acquaintance 
with Mr. Van Vechten were certainly 
not about him, not requested by him, 
not misdirected by him, some of them 
not liked by him nor, so far as I know, 
do they in any way bear his poetic 
influence, 


My second book is what I person- 
ally desired it to be and if the poems 
which it contains are low-down, jazzy, 
cabaret-ish, sensational, and utterly un- 
couth in the eyes of Mr. Davis the 
fault is mine,—not Mr. Van Vechten’s. 
I do not resent Mr. Davis’ criticism 
of my work and I know very well that 
a “reat many persons agree with him, 
—-nay, go even farther in believing that 
a'l of my verses are tainted with the 
evils of utter blackness. To such 
people my poems are as the proverbial 
red rag to the bull. To say the least 
they seem quite distasteful to them and 
evidently not the kind of reading diet 
on which they should feed, but I am 
not hurt about it. I have never pre- 
tended to be keeping a literary grazing 
pasture with food to suit all breeds of 
cattle. However, for the sake of 
truth, I cannot allow Mr. Davis’ 
rather extravagant misstatement of 
fact to go unanswered, therefore this 
letter offering a correction.

LEASE permit me to congratulate 

you ‘©n your acceptance of Mr, 
Woodruff’s painting which decorates 
your August Number of THe Crisis, 
I am sure that this picture will com- 
mand attention to this magazine on 
any news stand in comparison with 
others. Of late I have been observing 
Mr. Woodruff’s work, and I have yet 
to find him guilty of producing this 
cheap theatrical jazz-tainted bunk 
called Negro Art. It is indeed pa- 
thetic to see so many of our prominent 
intellectuals, artists and writers stoop- 
ing to such depths for no other reason 
than to see themselves in print. 

As a matter of fact, the Negro art- 
ist shows no more backbone in his 
chosen field than do other Negroes 
in various capacities. The truth of 
the matter is that they have allowed a 
hand full of half-cultured whites tell 
them what to write and paint. This 
they have accepted, believing it to be 
typical of the desires of the general 
white public, which is not true at 
TE 6 tan

May I take this opportunity of 
thanking you for the editorial en- 
titled “Visitors” in the column headed 
Postscript in the July Crisis. I im- 
agine every person who holds an ad- 
ministrative position especially in the 
so-called “field of public life” has suf- 
fered from the thoughtlessness of the 
type of visitor you describe. I have 
never heard or read this problem put 
so clearly as you put it in the above- 
named article. It ought to accomplish 
considerable good.

E have received the following let- 

ter concerning Thomas H. Tib- 
bles, a companion of John Brown and 
once candidate for Vice President on 
the Populist ticket, who recently died. 
“Mr. Tibbles was one of the big- 
souled people with a passion for jus 
tice. His daughter was troubled by 
the triviality of reference in the Ass0- 
ciated Press to one whose life’ was 
given over to noble causes. She writes: 
‘What particularly incensed me was 
the fact that though -my father, 
through his own efforts, and the ef 
forts of those who gathered round him, 
was solely instrumental in changing

having the Indians made citizens, the 
papers never mentioned this. He made 
the flight of the Pancas a success—a 
flight which the Evening~ Post called 
gs dramatic and tragic as the flight of 
the Tartars. Mr. Tibbles took a 
‘boy’s part in the Civil War’. 

“The person writing to you has been 
a member of the N. A. A. C. P. and 
a subscriber to THE Crisis for years. 
She is one of the white people who 
recognizes differences in individuals 
only and has never been able to see 
that a difference of race or creed or 
color breaks into our human solidarity. 
And this is not in thought only but in 
actual feeling. But she was born this 
wav. Other white people are born 
differently. ‘Forgive them, for they 
know not what they do.’ 

“With deep appreciation of your ex- 
traordinary, courageous, and far-seeing 
leadership.” 

LEASE accept my hearty thanks 

for your splendid editorial on 
“Darrow” in the June Crisis. I am 
in complete accord with every word of 
it; and I wish every Negro in Amer- 
ica could read it again and again. 
You will kindly pardon me for men- 
tioning the fact that I said practically 
the same thing to a Negro minister a 
few evenings ago on our train en route 
from Birmingham, Alabama, to Chat- 
tanooga, Tennessee. 

A few years ago when I came near 
losing faith in white people, it was not 
saintly Christians like William J. 
Bryan, Billy Sunday and Bishop Man- 
ning that gave me hope, but radicals 
and infidels like Bob Ingersoll, 
Thomas Paine, Eugene V. Debs and 
Clarence Darrow: Creeds and names 
don’t mean a damn thing to me, but 
deeds do. There is not a minister in 
America that I respect more and love 
as much as I do Clarence Darrow. 











If you publish this note, (and you 
are at liberty to do so), please omit the 
sentence containing the word, damn. 

[We didn’t have the heart so we 
omitted the name!—Eprror.] 





NTIL this letter of the “white 

\/ bourgeois intellectual” appeared 
in the April Crisis I was content to 
allow you the last word re the political 
trend of your magazine. Your cour- 
age in defence was so unbolshevikian 
and fine I felt the conduct of the mag- 
azine and the continuation of its high 
literary quality could after all be 
trusted to you. But here comes along 
aforesaid intellectual who says 

re can be no race equality so long 
as “the economic necessity exists for 
ping the races hostile”, a fact which 


September, 1928 





_you must “reanze and emphasize’’. She 


also says your magazine “is entirely 
too high-brow”’ and that it will appeal 
to your “race vanity”. Whereupon a 
phrase in Dr. Dorsey’s book ““Why we 
behave like human beings” comes 
rushing to my mind—‘‘How ‘low’ (he 
says) the savage European must have 
seemed to the Nile Valley African 
looking North from his pyramid of 
Cheops”. 

And then there was the letter anent 
“Caucasians” — 

Dear Dr, Dubois, if you would only 
forget your prejudice and laugh with 
me. You wouldn’t believe it but Dr. 
Dorsey also says in his book “There is 
no known fact of human anatomy or 
psychology which implies that capacity 
for culture or civilization or intelli- 
gence inheres in this race or that type”. 
Again “How ‘low’ the savage Euro- 
pean must have seemed to the Nile 
Valley African looking North from 
his pyramid of Cheops”. 

Yours for more culture, more poetry 
and oil-wells, pretty girls and bankers. 


HeEten Dow PEckK. 
White American middlebrow. 


AM sure you could not remember 
me as one of the young white ladies 
which Mr. William Pickens intro- 
duced to you after your lecture on 


Russia at Howard University this last 
March .... 


I want to say as further introduc- 
tion that one of my great interests in 
life is to do all that I can to increase 
for the American Negro his oppor- 
tunities for “life, liberty and the pur- 
suit of happiness”. I am humiliated 
because of the injustices which mem- 
bers of the white race have practiced 
toward members of the black race. The 
practice of lynching is undoubtedly 
one of the worst stains on our con- 
temporary American civilization and I 
should gladly give my life if that 
would end it. 

But, Dr. DuBois, I hope you will 
not misunderstand me when I protest 
against the last paragraph of your ar- 
ticle “Mob Tactics” on page 204 of 
the August Crisis. I read the Crisis 
more regularly, perhaps, than I read 
any other paper because of my inter- 
est in the welfare of the American 
Negro. 

My protest is against your suggested 
solution for lynching. I believe the 
toting of guns will be no solution for 
this problem; instead it will only aug- 
ment it. I honestly believe that any 
individual of any race or nation is 
in a more dangerous condition with 
a gun than without it. A gun does 
not insure safety but invites harm. 
I am opposed to an individual carry- 
ing a gun as I am opposed to any na- 
tion having large armies and navies. 


I believe the safer way is the way of 
goodwill and friendship. We need 
never be afraid of our friends. 

I am not asking you to acquiesce and 
allow lynching to continue and other 
conditions to become. worse. Instead, 
I would urge you on to greater ac- 
tivity in breaking down the barriers 
which have been built between the two 
groups and I would consecrate myself 
more completely to the task of sub- 
stituting goodwill for prejudice, love 
for hatred, and co-operation for dis- 
sension. But I am asking that you 
propose a solution which will enable 
us to attain our goal and improve con- 
ditions instead of making them more 
complex and difficult. There is a way 
out of this problem, I believe, as there 
is a way out of every problem. And 
that way lies along the path of love 
and goodwill. This is not a vague 
ideal—it is a reality and works when- 
ever tried. I suggest it here because 
I have such absolute faith in it. 

I cannot censure you for the sug- 
gestion you have made. I have felt 
something of the desperation which, I 
am sure, has been upon you and it is 
with a real desire to help find that 
true solution that I send this protest. 

The American Negro has traveled 
far on the road of non-resistance and 
I know that I am putting a huge task 
on him when I ask him to go still tur- 
ther on the road of active goodwill but 
I am confident that only in this way 
will he ever find his goal. Yes, it’s a 
rough and stony path; but not so 
rough, not so stony, not so dangerous 
as the path of gun toting. 

' Mary Ipa WInoper. 


Y Dear Mrs. BAILie: 

I have been astonished at the at- 
titude of the Daughters of the Ameri- 
can Revolution toward you and toward 
others, including myself. Personally, 
I have long been a Socialist. ‘That is, 
one who believes in the administration 
of wealth and of the division of income 
tor the good of the community, rather 
than simply for private interests. I 
am unaware that such an attitude is 
either revolutionary or dangerous. I 
was once, myself, a member of the 
Massachusetts Chapter of the Sons of 
the American Revolution through my 
Negro great-grandfather, who fought 
in the Revolution. I was compelled to 
resign when the headquarters at Wash- 
ington found out that I was of Negro 
descent. If membership in patriotic 
societies is‘ going to involve discrimina- 
tion against race and honest belief in 
reform, then such organizations are on 
the straight road toward suicide. 

I wish you all success in your fight 
for decency and patriotism against the 
persons now in control of the D. A. R. 

W. E. B. Du Bos.

PERSONAL 


@ Mrs. Hannah Harleston Mickey 
is dead at Charleston, S. C., at the 
age of 79 years. She was the widow 
of an undertaker who estabilshed his 
business in 1884 and died in 1899, 
leaving her with the responsibility of 
rearing five children. She was raised 
on her father’s plantation and edu- 
cated at Avery Institute, Charleston. 
Her children have been trained at 
Simmons College, Boston, Columbia 
University, Atlanta University and 
elsewhere. The undertaking business 
is still being carried on by her sons. 
@ William Grandison, who died re- 
cently in Massachusetts was well- 
known in New England as a printer. 
He was born in Canada in 1848 and 
came as a typesetter to Boston. For a 
long time he had difficulty in securing 
admission to the Union, but after an 
all-night debate, he finally was de- 
clared a member of Union Number 
61. He worked for years at the well- 
known Riverside Press and secured the 
admission of many colored workers. 
At one time he published the Boston 
Advocate and for the last twenty-five 
years had his own job printing office 
in Cambridge. His aunt’s home on 
Flagg Street, Cambridge, was the 
boarding place of several Harvard 
students, including the Editor of THE 
CRIsIs. 

@ Dr. A. P. Davis of Kansas City, 
Kansas, a surgeon, is interested in avia- 
tion and owns and pilots his own 
plane. He is said to be the second 
colored pilot in the United States to 
obtain a license. Recently, he pur- 
chased an American Eagle Bi-plane 


Diamond Cox 


Mrs. H. H. Mickey 


with a 90-horse power Curtis motor. 
He intends to use the plane for his pro- 
fessional work and for pleasure. Dr. 
Davis was denied the right to store 
his plane in any of the numerous fly- 
ing fields near Kansas City because of 
his color, but he employed a private 
instructor and hopes to establish a 
school of his own. 

@ The funeral of George E. Dixon, 
who died at Johnson City, Tennes- 
see, was the largest ever seen there. 
Mr. Dixon was born and educated in

City. He worked hard and cop. 
scientiously and died of pneumonia 
February 22nd. 
@ William E. Harmon, the founder 
ot the Harmon Foundation, died July 
15th at the age of 66. He was widely 
known for his generosity, but more 
especially among colored people for the 
“Harmon Awards for distinguished 
achievement among Negroes”. His 
main occupation was the development 
of real estate in which work he made 
his fortune. During the last five years 
he has loaned more than $300,000 to 
students working their way through 
colleges and his philanthropies will be 
carried on by his family and corpora- 
tions which he has formed. 

@ Diamond Cox of Jackson, Missis- 
sippi, died in June. He was born a 
slave in 1858, educated at Tougaloo 
College, and for twenty-one years was

Mason, and a member of the N. A. 
A. C. P. He is survived by a widow 
and eight children. 

@ William V. Chambliss, a graduate 
of Tuskegee N. and I. Institute, died 
recently leaving an estate of $100,000.

THE FAR HORIZON

HAITI 


HE News Bulletin of the Foreign 
Policy Association says: 

In 1915 President Guillaume Sam 
went on a rampage and caused 200 pris- 
oners in the Haitian jails to be mas- 
sacred. He sought refuge in the French 
Legation but the irate relatives of his 
victims violated this sanctuary and tore 
Guillaume Sam to bits. The upshot was 
that the United States intervened. 


In order to regularize our position, 
we induced the Haitian Government to 
sign a treaty in 1915 turning over to 
us the administration of the country ex- 
cept the judicial system, education and 
local government. In 1917 the life of 
this treaty was extended until 1936. Al- 
though President Borno and his cabinet 
are the titular heads of the government, 
the United States now governs Haiti 
through a High Commissioner and five 
“Treaty Officials,’—the financial ad- 
viser and general receiver, and the heads 
of the gendarmerie, public works, the 
service technique (or agricultural de- 
partment), and a medical service. The 
High Commissioner is General John H. 
Russell, and three out of the five Treaty 
Officials are: officers of the marines. Al- 
together there are about 100 Americans 
in the Haitian Government, in addition 
to a brigade of marines. The financial 
adviser is technically responsible to the 
Haitian minister of finance, while the 
American heads of the gendarmerie, pub- 
lic works and medical service are the- 
oretically responsible to a Haitian min- 
ister of the interior. 


Through these 100 officials and the 
brigade of marines the United States has 
restored order, abolished the petty exac- 
tions of officialism, straightened out a 
dismal financial situation, built imposing 
public works and improved the health 
of the Haitian people. While it has 
done nothing for general education, it 
is building up effective agricultural 
schools. 

However there is a debit side of the 
ledger. We have sent to Haiti honest 
men—men who know how to maintain 
order and to keep accounts. But we 
have not sent to Haiti statesmen—men 
who thoroughly sympathize with Haiti’s 
aspiration for independence, who under- 
stand how to train a people to be free. 
The system which we have installed may 
be efficient but it is not educational. The 
Haitian cabinet is composed of idle min- 
isters and President Borno is every- 
where regarded as America’s marionette. 
The Haitian minister of finance has less 
responsibility in the administration of 
revenue than the unlettered Negro treas- 
urer of a native state in a British colony 
in Africa. Apart from the “assistance” 
rendered by marine advisers, nothing has 


310 








been done to improve local self-govern- 
ment. While orders are given in the 
name of the President and while laws 
are passed by a dummy Council of 
State, the initiative comes from the 
Americans. If the Haitian Government 
does anything, it is to obstruct. 

For a century the Haitian people had 
a legislature and the right to vote. But 
in 1915 the doors of this legislature were 
closed by American marines and they 
have not been opened since. A Coun- 
cil of State elects the President and the 
President appoints the Council of State. 
There is no popular election and the 
United States marines permit no revolu- 
tion. The result is dictatorship. In de- 
fense of this situation, American and 
Haitian officials state that elections in 
Haiti are impossible because of the il- 
literacy of the people. Yet in January, 
1928, the people solemnly voted upon a 
set of constitutional amendments which 
were “adopted” by the overwhelming ma- 
jority of 176,000 to 3,300. The United 
States assisted in this election by plac- 
ing trucks at the disposition of the 
Borno Government to take voters to the 
polls. If the United States insists on 
“fair” elections in Nicaragua and else- 
where in Central America, is it unrea- 
sonable to ask why in the one country 
where it is in the position to secure such 
elections, it should be a party to a jocose 
fraud? 


JOSEPHINE BAKER 


OWARD COXE wants to be 

fair but is afraid that the world 
may forget he is a white American. 
He reviews Josephine Baker’s biog- 
raphy which has just appeared in 
France, in the New Republic: 


Much seems to have happened to 
Miss Josephine Baker since first she 
came into the limelight with “Shuffle 
Along” four years ago. If there could 
be still some doubts’ about her merits 
as an artist, or even as a serious thinker, 
certainly there could be none about her 
popularity abroad. With Mistinguette 
growing a trifle too elderly to hold the 
affections of the public, and with the 
Dolly Sisters becoming so very chic, 
there is perhaps no entertainer so much 
esteemed in Paris as Miss Baker. She 
has become a grande vedette. Cock- 
tails have been named for her, also a 
hair oil called Bakerfix. Masses for 
the souls of her audiences are sung in 
cathedrals while she is doing the 
Charleston in the theaters, and now she 
has written, or rather dictated to an 
interpreter, her memoirs and ideas on 
life. 

It seems improbable that Miss 
Baker’s memories and impressions will 





a 


Br, 
oh 


be translated into English: they are 
more frivolous than profound, more de. 
cent than important. Nevertheless it js 
a pity: they are stimulating in a certain 
freshness and absurdity which is not often 
to be found, and they make you feel 
that, waiving prejudice, you would like 
Miss Baker. There is a refreshing 
candor about her, a naiveté and unpre. 
tentiousness and a complete absence of 
sentimentalism. She is still a pickaninny, 
a pickanniny transplanted to alien soil, 
She started dancing, she says, because 
it was cold in St. Louis and she needed 
to dance to keep warm. She attributes 
her success entirely to the rabbit's foot 
which she carries on her person night 
and day. She says she was born to 
dance: she would be happy to die danc- 
ing—though not in a music hall. “T’l] 
get married some day—I want lots of 
babies and animals around. I love 
them. I want to live a peaceful life, 
with babies and animals all around. But 
if a child of mine ever wants to go on 
the stage, I swear I'll strangle him with 
my two hands.” 

Aside from the rabbit’s foot and a few 
other natural superstitions, Miss Baker 
is a complete realist. She likes cornbeet 
hash and hot-cakes, animals of all kinds, 
loud colors, dolls “without bones in 
them”. She detests all ballet dancing. 
She distrusts the use of cosmetics as aids 
to beauty. She owns a seven-volume 
dictionary which she has never read: she 
finds it fun to lift one volume at a time 
and see how heavy such a lot of words 
are. She has as little use for celebrities 
as for literature. “I’ve met a lot of 
people with reputations. They don’t in- 
timidate me. I most admire those who 
work hardest. Everybody is made with 
two arms and two legs and a stomach 
and a head. That gives you enough to 
think about,” 


SUPERIOR SOUTH CAROLINA 
OBERT QUILLIAN writes in 


the Tribune of Fountain Inn, 
South Carolina, concerning his state: 


There is no other section of America 
where men are so quick to defend their 
honor as in South Carolina. 

There is no other section where met 
are so quick to fight when given the 
lie. 

There is no other section where s0 
much is said about chivalry and the 
duty of shielding the gentler sex. 

There. is no other section where so 
much is said about being a gentleman. 

There is no other section where re- 
ligion figures so largely in the scheme 
of existence. 

There is no section more certain of 
its superiority in righteousness.

Crisis: 


THE CALIFORNIA CON- 
FERENCE 


HERE is a lure and charm about 
T California that grows with know- 
ing. It is a land that sweeps from pine 
to palm, from ocean to snow-capped 
peak, from shrewd cold to breathless 
desert heat. One hesitates to epitomize 
it either with the vast and withdrawn 
mystery of Mt. Shasta, or the great 
inland sea of the Golden Gate or the 
sweep of the boulevards of Los An- 
geles. The last I know best and they 
grip me with nameless ecstasy. To 
sing with the sun of a golden morning 
and dip, soar and roll over Wiltshire 
or out to Pasedena where one of the 
Seven Streets of the World blooms; 
or out Washington to the sigh of the 
sound of the sea—this is Glory and 
Triumph and Life. One must be alone 
or with a perfect companion; there 
must be silence and dreamful thought 
and one must guide his car himself un- 
hampered—free. Nowhere else in the 
world is there such a stretch of endless 
avenue bordered with flowers and 
palms and doll houses. Then of an 
evening let others drive and nestle be- 
hind with laughing, low-voiced friends 
and go down by the dark Pacific with 
pepper trees and ragged Eucalyptus, 
or up and out Vernon avenue toward 
the stars, and breathless behold the 
stars below—the sea of the stars of the 
angels—the endless. and unbounded 
city of Los Angeles. 

There could be no more romantic 
and poignantly gripping setting for the 
nineteenth conference of the N. A. A. 
C. P. It seemed right that such a 
gathering and flowing of peoples en- 
gulfed us. The depot swarmed with 
flags and autos and welcoming faces 
so that we seemed few and lost—we 
wise men from the East. And all 
through the week the hosts poured in 
upon our meetings in hundreds and 
thousands until the Shrine Temple 
billowed like a sea with its six thou- 
- who sat four hours to see and 
ear. 


Our first impression was neither hill 


nor vale nor waters. It was neither 


tree nor fruit—but a house. It was 
a hotel—a jewel done with loving 

; a soft intimate, laughing hos- 
telry, with high, uplifted ceilings, with 
ainty colors and long, soft draperies. 


September. 19028

4 MED Du Leu 
—_—— 


It was all full of sunshine and low 
voices and the sound of human laugh- 
ter and running water. The Hotel 
Somerville was an extraordinary sur- 
prise to a people fed on ugliness—ugly 
schools, ugly churches, ugly streets, 
ugly insults. We heard of the hotel 
askance—we were prepared for,—well 
something that didn’t leak and was 
hastily clean and too new for vermin. 
And we entered a beautiful Inn with 
a soul—with Humor and Joy and 
Flowers and Music; with pretty girls 
in white to serve food, tempted to deli- 
cacies in a kitchen where we went 
visiting on thrilling excursions. The 
long, high windows West and South 
piled secret sunlight on a balcony with 
winding stair and grilled iron and 
white linen. 

Funny that a hotel so impressed us 
—but it was so unexpected, so start- 
ling, so beautiful. Next came the 
business - meetings. We expect now 
large N. A. A. C. P. mass meetings— 
even the 10,000 of Indianapolis and 
Kansas City no longer surprise us. But 
we expect too, thin mornings and lan- 
guid afternoon while delegates are 
sleeping and visiting. Not so Los An- 
geles. Morning sessions were almost 
crowded and afternoons full. All day 
the autos rolled in procession about 
the Second Baptist. All day crowds 
milled in the corridors. Indeed some 
say that the morning session when the 
Junior division took charge was in 
many respects the high water mark of 
the conference and set new marks and 
methods for the future. There was a 
perfect presiding officer—a_ speech 
which THe Crisis will publish with 
pleasure and a whole air and atmos- 
phere of earnestness and devotion 
which leads us to believe that Jazz 
has not wholly captured our babies; 
perhaps its Joy has prepared them for 
the grim tragedy of American race 
hatred. 


The crowds and speeches and music 
of the meetings swim in a great flood 
of memories. It is difficult to bring 
them out and disentangle them and 
make them real again. I remember 
the straight-forward welcome of the 
Governor. It did not sound like a 
mere politician’s clap-trap. Pickens 
was keen, piercing and humorous be- 
vond reproduction. Johnson and his 


audience were one and throbbed in 
unison over lynching. Chesnutt was 
delicious and the lost sheets of his 
speech made his audience but gnora 
eager. Bishop Martin had som: 
shrewd ethical advice. I was pleased 
to find Harry Davis’ auditors and ny 
own hearers so easily aroused to eu- 
thusiastic comprehension of the present 
political campaign. We had Lincoln 
Steffens and an East Indian, S. G. 
Pandit, and we had choruses that sang 
“Lift Every Voice” as I have not heard 
it before. Florence Cole Talbert sang 
for us and Carolyn Snowden danced. 

The debates on policy and business 
were well sustained. 

And yet when all is said in detail 
and of words and personalities, not 
half has been told. There was a fine, 
big, broad spirit with us among the 
flowers and fruit of Southern Cali- 
fornia. ‘There was wide comprehen- 
sion and hope. There was a pulling 
together and a pledge of still greater 
things. I did not hear a single petty, 
carping word. Everybody worked, 
thought, promised. 

We sold books through Mrs. 
Thompson, more than were ever sold 
before. We sold a thousand copies 
of THe Crisis and we vowed to make 
the Cleveland meeting in 1929 larger 
and better than the Los Angeles—some 
vow, I'll surely say. 


I have seen the N. A. A. C. P. con- 
ferences develop for twenty years. 
There were at first the ordinary de- 
sultory ‘“conventions’—sparsely  at- 
tended meetings, half prepared papers, 
bunk, and a good time outside. the 
meetings. Then they stiffened and be- 
came more earnest. They lengthened 
from three days to a week and instead 
of becoming thinner and less inter- 
esting, they were better attended and 
more earnest. Today there is not a 
national meeting among Negroes and 
few among whites that compare with 
an N. A. A. C. P. annual conference 
for real attendance, thoroughness of 
program, preparedness of speakers and 
earnestness of intent. No church nor 
Sunday school conference, no fraternal 
body, no social organization can ap- 
proach the satisfaction and devotion to 
business that marks these meetings. 
The publicity they attain, the listen- 
ing world that follows them, opens a 


311 







































new era for the American Negro. And 
we have but begun. We are going in 
the future to break our own high 
mark. 


There has been neither the bribery 
and electioneering that made a recent 
church general conference a national 
disgrace; none of the drunkenness and 
debauchery that has clouded many 
meetings: of secret orders and nothing 
of that indifference and lack of pro- 
fessional interest that has marked pro- 
fessional meetings. And this because 
of no superior breed of peoples, (we 
are all the same!) but, because of 
earnest, clear thought, lack of bunk 
and confusion and comprehension of a 
clear high aim. 


HOWARD 


HE Republican Party is playing 

one of its dirtiest political games 
in the case of Perry Howard. God 
knows THe Crisis has no brief for 
Howard. If the charges are true, he 
is a grafting politician of the most con- 
temptible sort—but accusations against 
him are not one whit worse than those 
against Bascom Slemp, erstwhile Con- 
gressman from Virginia, then Secre- 
tary to Calvin Coolidge and now in 
charge of the Republican campaign in 
the South. Slemp, Howard, Tolbert, 
Ben Davis and most of the Southern 
politicians, black and white, of both 
parties, have trafficked in public offices. 
White Democrats have bought offices 
and white Republicans, like Herbert 
Hoover, have received the votes thus 
paid for in the National Republican 
Conventions. The whole situation is 
a crying shame to American politics 
and remains so because the mass of 
black voters in the South is dis- 
franchised and their political power 
wielded by grafting politicians of all 
colors and conditions. When the 
pinch comes and the insurgent West 
joins with the white South in demand- 
ing investigation, it is only the black 
politicians who are investigated while 
Slemp, Tolbert and their kind, go free. 
Let all the northern black voters who 
are fools vote for Hoover in Novem- 


ber. 


HOUSTON 


F the Democratic party was openly 

and thoughtfully planning to alienate 
the intelligent Negro vote in the 
North, they certainly were eminently 
successful. They opened their conven- 
tion with an atrocious lynching. They 
segregated their black visitors back of 
a wire cage. They nominated for 
Vice President (an office which, since 
the Civil War, has made its incumbent 
President in four cases) a_ typical 
Arkansas bourbon. Even the nomina- 
tion of Alfred Smith does not relieve 


312 


the situation. Smith is an excellent 
administrator and his attitude on liquor 
is at least honest, while Hoover’s is 
not; but so far as we can learn Alfred 
Smith has seldom been aware of the 
black citizens of the state of New 
York. He has given 250,000 Ne- 
groes of the state only one major ap- 
pointment and has shown for black 
people not the slightest personal inter- 
est or appreciation. He has consis- 
tently vetoed every bill and movement 
which Negroes advocated. 

The Catholic church, to which 
Smith belongs, knows no color line in 
all the world except in the United 
States; but here it is “Jim-Crow” from 
top to bottom in church attendance, in 
education, in philanthrophy, in mis- 
sionary endeavor. 

Finally, whatever Smith and _ his 
entourage might be inclined to do to 
attract Negro support, they are abso- 
lutely estopped from doing by their 
corrupt bargain with the solid South 
and their craven fear of the “liberal” 
South. Black voters of the North who 
support Smith should first vote for him 
and then commit suicide. 


BOOZE 


HAT intrigues us about Mary of 

the Unfortunate Name is not 
the fact that she is colored and the 
daughter of the late Isaiah Mont- 
gomery; or even that she is a machine 
politician of what is to us the most 
offensive sort; but what really inter- 
ests us is the inner workings of the 
minds of those distinguished white 
ladies who called the late conference of 
the Republican Committee Women in 
Washington. They were, many of 
them well-bred and all of them well- 
gowned, Most of them belonged to 
Christian churches. Yet, jointly and 
severally, they did a disgustingly mean 
thing. They invited Mrs. Booze to 
entertainment and luncheon and then 
sneaked off when her back was turned 
and lunched without her. In all this, 
Mrs. Booze comes out decidedly in the 
better position. These Republican 
women acted like cads; the Negro wo- 
man swallowed the insult, explained it 
away and remained—a Republican. 


CONGRESS 


HE voter in the next campaign 
should keep one thing clearly in 
mind: it makes small difference to him 


as to who is President. Both Smith 
and Hoover represent Big Business and 
the Solid South; but it makes an enor- 
mous difference as to who is Congress- 
man from his district. The voters in 
every congressional district should con- 
scientiously and tirelessly investigate 
the congressional nominee: they should 
get his record in the past—his acts 


and votes when in public office, his 
writings, his speeches, and his present 
treatment of black folk; they should 
get the categorical promise of each 
nominee as to his attitude toward the 
Negro problem, lynching, liquor, farm 
relief, and government by organized 
wealth; and then, without any regard 
as to what the Congressman calls him- 
self, or by whom he is nominated, vote 
for him or against him according to his 
promises and particularly according to 
his past record. Everything else in this 
campaign is criss-cross and crazy, ex- 
cept the choice of individual members 
of Congress. 


LYNCHING 


N the annual address to the country 

issued by the N. A. A. C. P., we 
congratulated the United" States be- 
cause one period of one hundred and 
twenty days passed without a Negro 
being lynched. It seems that after all 
we were wrong. Here is the photo 
graph of a man lynched in Florida 
“sometime during the latter part of 
February or the first of March”. The 
snapshot was taken by a travelling 
salesman who had the film developed 
at Melbourne, Alabama, and then 
gave a copy to a colored police officer. 
We have been able to get no further 
information. We do not know what 
the name of the man who was lynched 
was or of what he was accused. He 
is evidently a well-dressed person and 
the hand-cuffs on his wrists show that 
he was in the custody of the officers 
of the law when murdered.

Possibility of Democracy 
(Continued from page 296) 





of a total literate Negro population 2} 


years of age and over, of (192)) 
290,782. A resident of the state 
writes : 

“The requirements for registration 
in this state are that the ipp! ticants 
must be able to ‘read and write’, of 


understand the Constitution when al 
to them and must have paid their pol] 
tax for the past two years prior to the 
time at which they offer 


for registra. 
tion. 

“The Clerk of the Circuit Court in 

each county, or his deputy, is the sole 


judge of every one’s ability to qualify 
for registration and he is invariably a 
Democrat and adamant. All white folk 
are ‘qualified’. If a white person can- 
not read or write, such person is al- 


ways able to ‘understand the constitu- 
tion when read’. Hence, all white folk 
vote. 


“When a colored man comes up to 
register, as a rule, he is either uncere- 
moneously ordered out of the office 
with an oath before a question even 
has been asked; or is told by the clerk 
that he is busy and hasn’t time to reg- 
ister him; or is given something to 
read or asked a question, only to have 
the registration book closed, slammed 
to, and be told that he cannot qualify. 

“The Negro vote is smaller now 
than a year ago, since the last legisla- 
ture called for a new registration and 
it appears that it is a most difficult 
matter, to géf “as many on the rolls as 
were registered before. For example, 
in Hinds, the largest county in the 
State, there were 98 Negroes registered 
a year ago, but only 60 now.” 

In the state of Georgia, out of 369,- 
511 Negroes 21 years of age and over, 
who can read and write, no one knows 
or is able to find out, apparently how 
many Negroes are registered. During 
the year 1926, 90,000 Negroes paid 
poll taxes and should have been en- 
titled to vote. It is doubtful, however, 
if as many as 10,000 actually voted. 

From Chatham County, where 22, 
678 Negroes 21 years of age and over 
can read and write, there were 2,200 
registered Negro voters in 1922 and 
900 in 1927. 

In Floyd County, where there are 
2,488 Negroes 21 years of age and 
over who can read and write, there are 
120 colored women and 154 colored 
men who are registered. 


N Texas the difficulties are illus 

trated by one incident brought to 
my attention in 1918. Marion County, 
Texas, has a population of. 10,886, of 
which 6,667 are Negroes. ‘There are 
2,146 whites 21 years of age and over, 
and 2,937 Negroes. Forty-three of the

whites are illiterate and 855 of the 
Negroes. It would look as though at 
least 1,500 of the Negroes were per- 
sons of intelligence and thrift, because 
they owned, in 1918, 85 per cent of the 
cultivated land and paid, outside the 
corporation taxes, over 50 per cent. of 
the taxes. Many Negroes owned farms 
of 1,000 acres and more,—one owning 
3,200 acres. The Negroes owned 23 
cotton gins, 25 grist mills, 32 saw 
mills and 17 shingle mills. There 
were 25 small merchants and one col- 
ored physician whose practice was 50 
per cent. white. The six months col- 
ored county schools was “fairly good”. 
The town school in Jefferson ran nine 
months and had ten grades. And yet, 
in the face of that, the following elec- 
tion notice was issued Tuesday, Sep- 
tember 3rd, 1918: 

To the People of Jefferson: 

The election to be held Tuesday, Sept. 
3rd is for the purpose of voting to re- 
peal the stock law or allowing it to stand 
as it is. 

It was unanimously voted by the 
Council to allow all White Citizens, 
Men and Women in the City of Jeffer- 
son, 21 years of age to vote on this 
question as the Council wants to know 
how the people stand on it. The people 
who are in favor of Repealing this law 
are willing that an Ordinance be passed 
allowing stock to run at large from 6 
A. M. from Ist day of April until Ist 
day of December which would be 8 
months in the year and put them up the 
remaining 4 months. You are all in- 
terested. 

So come out and vote. 

The Committee. 

It must be remembered that a Stock 
Law, which regulates the fencing of 
crops and the running at large of stock, 
is of great importance, both to the 
farmer and the small town worker.

“Genevieve!” he called. 

“Yes?”—and the maid entered the 
recom. 

“Where’s Tom?” 

“TI dunno, Mr. Cutney, I dunno. He 
was gone early this mornin’. It wasn’t 
his fault—” 

“Oh—get to hell out of here... . 
The dirty black skunk!” 


ENEVIEVE got out. He felt 
like shaking her squat stupidity 
into a screaming litheness. 

Cutney sat down on the bed. He 
looked at his tired sleeping wife, and 
pondered in an agony. He might have 
known. The brute, the splendidly built 
brute, was only an animal—lazy, grace- 
tul, moony as an animal. Inarticulate. 
His songs were a baying at the moon. 
He had done this thing crudely, pow- 
erfully, brutally, as a beast does. Slow, 
relentless, watching for an opportunity, 
then fleeing in the night. 

He thought of Tom swimming, 
hugely enjoying his sleek, smiling body. 
The damned animal—the dirty brute. 
He should have been crushed, obliter- 
ated. 

Tom singing. The ease of it, the 
smooth flow untroubled by conscious- 
ness, the earthy, nocturnal fascination 
of it. Animal caterwauling—a cooler 
caterwauling. Its final expression this 
brutality. 

The hours passed. He had stripped 
Tom of his clothes. He thought of 
him naked, his blackness baking in the 
sun, stretching in the sun, rolling, 
prowling. The long arms and hands 
had held his wife. . . . He looked for 
bruises on her face. There were none. 

.. The damned brute. 

Thus for hours. His mind ground 
over and over again his hatred, his dis- 
gust. His small stock of profanity 
failed to appease his profound wrath. 
His final picture of Tom was of a 
monstrous malevolence, a giant, leer- 
ing gorilla. 

“You’re wanted on the ’phone, Mr. 
Cutney,” Genevieve’s hushed voice 
called through the door. 

Cutney went, numbly. 

“Hello. This is Ralleck. 

We're organizing a gang to get that 
damned — — — —. Yeh, it’s all 
over town. Prennel’s spread it. We’re 
goin’ right away. ... The sheriff’s 
barkin’ up the wrong tree.... We'll 
let you know when we get ’im. .. . 


Good-bye.” 


UTNEY went to the bedroom, 
brushing aside a terrified and pal- 
ritating Genevieve. . . . The beast de- 
served it. Such brutes should be 
crushed to pulp. He imagined keen 
tortures. 
His wife’s movements interrupted 
his enjoyment. Her hands were grip-

ping the blanket. Her head rolled 
slightly to one side on the pillow. 

“Oh, Tom. . . . Oh, Tom,” she 
murmured. 

The voice puzzled Cutney. ‘There 
was not terror in it, nor tears, nor hor- 
ror. There was sadness, melancholy. 
What was the heavily breathed aspirate 
quality of it? A sort of eagerness, 
mingled with pain? Bosh! it was 
fright, terror, worn a little thin and 
strange by exhaustion . . . The damned 
dirty nigger. Poor Marion! 

She was awaking. Cutney called 
Prennel over the telephone. And, 
while he waited, he re-aligned his in- 
dictments, his exquisite, shining tor- 
tures, dismissed the insistent irrelev- 
ance of the voice’s sound. 

The doctor came just the telephone 
rang again. It was Ralleck. Tom 
was caught. The gang was near 
Layne’s farmhouse. Would Cutney 
come immediately ? 

“Can I use your car, Doc?” he 
asked. 

“Sure. I'll walk to town. 
maid’ll look after your wife.” 

As he drove, thoughts of revenge 
seemed to lose their relish. ‘The sound 
of his wife’s voice, that liquid murmur 
out of her unconsciousness, gnawed at 
him. He drove faster and faster, away 
from the voice. He tried concentrat- 
ing his mind on profanity, but to no 
avail. The voice followed. 

In twenty minutes he saw the crowd, 
lapping over into the road. Ralleck, 
a burly fellow, ran toward him as the 
brakes slowed down the car. 

“We couldn’t wait,” he was say- 
ing. “The damned skunk insulted 
your wife—so we strung him up right 
away. There ain’t a kick left in him.” 

Cutney looked up to where Ralleck 
pointed. Tom dangled from an oak 
branch, limp, his fine uprightness gone. 

“Insulted my wife, did he?” he mut- 
tered. 

“Yeh — we 
woman—” 

“Thanks, boys,” Cutney interrupted 
hastily, and turning his car into 
Layne’s roadway, he backed into the 
road and left. . .’.

“Pardon me. But listen. I hear 
the children coming, the children of

belongs. Do you hear them? They 
will soon be running down this slope

Little Rose held herself very still. 

“Look!” whispered Gladiolus as six 
merry boys and girls danced down the 


hill toward the flower beds. ‘The 


children 
friends.” 
“But what of that?” inquired Little 
Rose. 
“Some of them are golden colored 


of the house and _ their 


and some of them are black. Some 
are blonde. Some are dark brown. 
Some are light brown.” 

“Yes?” My Little Rose waited. 

“That, My little Rose, is why I 
lcve them. Their foreparents were 
brought from Africa. So were ours. 
They are of many colors. So are we. 
Are they not the Gladioli? Will you 
bow to them, My Little Rose? Will 


you bow to them?” 


The Poet’s Corner 
(Continued from page 300) 

Did I carp when you created beautiful 
curls, 

Becoming curls, to deck your Marcian 
Bob? 

Or of the Bob itself? 

Or of how you smiled to hear me sing 

Of how Malindy sings? 

Or when you required of me the sad 
songs of my fathers? 

Or when your body lilted to the sway 
of new folk music? 

And your nimble feet tangled in the 
double-quick movement of my 
body-wriggling, syncopated dance? 

Did I charge that you were aping me? 

(Why should I 

Or why should anyone?) 

I only thought that you were questing 
Beauty. 


Oh friend let’s be kind to one another! 

Let us be mutual teachers, 

Mutually questing El Dorado; 

Lovely Arcady; 

Those are wonderful Hands that fash- 
ioned us! 

Handle those cosmetics softly; 

I would more beautify these curls, 

This skin; 

Would refine this brain. 

Oh chide me not if I met Keats and 
Poe, 

If I met Keats and Poe— 

And love them!

delegates on the special trains were 
pessimistic as to the kind of hotel that 
could be built in so short a time. The 
astonishment and admiration was un- 
bounded when June 27th they were 
ushered into a new hotel with 100 
rooms and sixty private baths, a patio 
and foyer with mezzanine writing 
room, elevators and dining room with 
balcony seating three hundred persons. 
@ The hotel is four stories in height, 
built of brick.” It extends eighty-five 
feet on Central Avenue and 120 feet 
on 41st Street, with a wide alley in 
the rear. On the ground floor there 
is a drug store, beauty shor, flower

The Far Horizon 
(Continued from page 310) 


There is no section where greater 
effort is made to observe and to en- 
force observance of Sunday as a day 
of holiness. 

There is no section where a larger 
percentage of the population frowns 
upon dancing, card playing and other 
“worldly” pleasures. : 

There is no section where whiskey 
and wine and beer are more bitterly 
denounced. 

There is no section where the law 
and the public are more severe in con- 
demnation of gambling. ; 

These statements are made without 
intent to be oratorical. They are a 
grave and simple statement of fact. 

And I speak from first-hand knowl- 
edge, for I have lived in Kansas, Okla- 
homa, Missouri, Nebraska, California, 
Washington; Virginia, West Virginia, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and 
Georgia, and have spent a little time 
in several other States. 

This section of the country, as I say, 
sets up high standards of righteous- 
ness, piety, chivalry and honor, and be- 
cause its blood is hot it is quick to re- 
sent any criticism of its imperfections. 

And yet I know of no other section 
that has so little reason to boast. 

There is no other section where so 
large a percentage of the male popula- 
tion will lie to make a dollar. 

There is no other section where so 
many men make debts they do not try 
to pay. 

There is no other section where dead- 
beats and liars are accepted by society 
as a whole and treated as courteously 
as honorable men. ; 

There is no other section where so 
many men make vulgar and insulting 
remarks about women, delights in filthy 
sex stories and abuse their wives. 

There is no other section where men 
who think themselves chivalrous con- 
tinue to treat women as inferiors who 
belong in the kitchen. 

te is no other section where men 
whe boast of being gentlemen are so 
abysmally ignorant of the qualities re- 
quired in the making of a gentleman. 

There is no other section where 
church membership and professed Chris- 
tianity leave men so free to practice the 


immoralities frowned upon by all 
churches. i 


There is no other section where 
church people, while professing to be- 
lieve the use of intoxicants sinful, con- 
sume so much moonshine whiskey. 

There is no other section where so 
many people who denounce dancing and 
card playing stoop to lying, cheating, 
slandering and stealing. 

There is no other section where so 
many church people frown on gambling 


@ yet gain and lose money in gam- 
mM cotton futures. 


is, in short, no other section 
of the United States where so large a 
Percentage of the population is com- 
posed of self-righteous hypocrites.

COMMUNISTS 


HE WORKERS’ ( Communist) 

Party of America, through its 
executive committee in New York, 
has issued the following manifesto in 
the Negro problem. 


The manifesto is the election cam. 
paign pronouncement of the Workers 
(Communist) Party on this important 
question. It contains the following de. 
mands, which are taken from the plat. 
form of the Workers ( Communist) 
Party and which demands clearly in. 
dicate the position of the Party on the 
lynchings and on the Negro question: 


1. A Federal law against lynching, 
and the protection of the Negro masses 
in their right of selt-detense. 

2. Abolition of the whole system of 
race discrimination. Full racial, politi. 
cal and social equality for the Negro 
race. 

3. Abolition of all laws which result 
in segregation of Negroes. Abolition of 
all Jim-Crow laws. The law shall for. 
bid all discrimination against Negroes 
in selling or renting houses. 

4. Abolition of all laws which dis 
franchise the Negroes. 

5. Abolition of laws forbidding inter. 
marriage of persons of different races, 

6. Abolition of all laws and public 
administration measures which prohibit, 
or in practice prevent, Negro children or 
youth from attending general public 
schools or universities. 

7. Full and equal admittance of 
Negroes to all railway station waiting 
rooms, restaurants, hotels, and theaters. 

8. Abolition of discriminatory prac- 
tices in courts against Negroes. No dis- 
crimination in jury service. 

9. Abolition of the convict lease sys- 
tem and “of the chain gang. 

10. Abolition of all Jim-Crow dis- 
tinctions in the army, navy and civil 
service. 

11. Immediate removal of all restric- 
tions in all trade unions against the 
membership of the Negro workers. 

12. Equal opportunity for employ- 
ment, wages, hours and working con- 
ditions for Negro workers and white 
workers. Equal pay for equal work for 
Negro and white workers. 

The manifesto clearly states the pos 
tion of the Democratic and Republican 
Parties in their attitude towards lynch- 
ing and comes to the conclusion that 
these two parties are not opposed to the 
lynching system but instead support 1 
It also points out that the candidates o! 
the Republican and Democratic Parties, 
Hoover and Smith, are both more inter- 
ested in maintaining the lynching system 
than in fighting it. In addition, it & 
poses the role of the Socialist Party om 
the Negro question, particularly its sup 
port of the segregation process as far 
as the Party itself is concerned, its sur 
port of the opposition to the organizt 
tion of Negro workers by Mr. Grett 
and other officials of the American Fed 
eration of Labor, and the fact that the 
Socialist Party does not oppose the role 
of Randolph, the leader of the Neg

AMERICA AND SOUTH 
AFRICA 


ILLIAM EVELEIGH con- 
W trasts the Negro problems of 
America and South Africa in the Lon- 
don Quarterly Review: 


The two countries present some ar- 
resting contrasts so far as the political 
aspects of the situation are concerned. 
At the present time natives in the Cape 
Province enjoy franchise rights on equal 
terms with Europeans, and in eight or 
ten constituencies they hold the balance 
of power. Altogether there are about 
14,000 native voters. In Natal, natives 
are entitled to a franchise, but it is so 
hedged about with conditions that there 
are but one or two persons really elig- 
ible. In the Transvaal and the Orange 
Free State all natives are by law ex- 
cluded from the franchise. 


In America, by the rights given to 
them in the fourteenth and fifteenth 
amendments to the Constitution, the 
Negroes are entitled to all the rights of 
other American citizens. In practice, 
however, they are not able to exercise 
those rights. The Southern States have 
adopted constitutional amendments that 
have restricted the Negro vote with the 
ultimate result that the Negro has been 
ruled out as a political factor. Where 
the weapons of State law have not been 
available, the methods of intimidation 
have been used with considerable force. 
In the South to-day, though the number 
of qualified Negro voters is steadily in- 
creasing, the Negro’s share in the gov- 
ernment is very limited indeed. In the 
North, however, he is able to exercise 
his franchise right, and in many States he 
is becoming an important factor in politi- 
cal life. All the signs go to indicate his 
larger participation in the government, 
in every phase of political life. 

But what do we find in South Africa? 
Here the state of public opinion is such 
that there is little hope of extending the 
Cape system—“‘equal rights for all civ- 
ilized men”—to the other provinces. The 
fear of submersion is too strong The 
Prime Minister, General Hertzog, advo- 
cates the abolition of the Cape franchise, 
the direct representation of natives in 


Parliament by seven special European’ 


members elected by the native commun- 
ity constituencies, and the provision of 
a Council system of parallel institutions 
possessing legislative or quasi-legislative 
powers over all the country, with the 
apex of the scheme a Union Native 
Council of fifty members with full ad- 
visory powers and also limited legislative 
powers. This is an indication that South 
Africa is prepared to make a bold politi- 
cal experiment rather than admit even 
the more advanced natives to suffrage 
rights. However, the natives who are 
able to express themselves protest unani- 
mously against the abolition of the Cape 

anchise, and in their attitude they are

$36,000 DRIVE FOR DUNCAN’S 
BUSINESS SCHOOL 


The Stenographers’ Institute, popularly 
known as Duncan’s Business School, is 
making a $36,000 Drive for funds to com- 
plete a work that was started with $5. 
The school now owns three buildings 
valued at $21,000, a school equipment of 
$6,000 and a large library; but Mr. Dun- 
can’s desire is to increase the present 
worth of the school to $500,000, through 
donations of friends and well-wishers, to 
make a place where at least 100 boys and 
girls, men and women may work in vari- 
ous lines, earning not less than $100 a 
month. Send all donations directly to 
Mr. Edward T. Duncan, 1227 South Sev- 
enteenth Street, Philadelphia, Pa. Mr. 
Duncan is also lecturing on “Use What 
You Have.” Why not organizations in 
churches and other fraternal societies ar- 
range for his lecture and earn a scholar- 
ship in the school for one of their mem- 
bers. Let’s raise the $36,000 quota by 
September 15th—what say you? Mail 
your check or money order within the 
next 36 hours.—Phidippides to Sparta.

supported by a section of the white pupu- 
lation. 

But white South African opinion would 
appear to be moving in the direction of 
a policy of differential development with 
a system of parallel institutions, whereby 
the native may be assigned’a share in his 
own governmental schemes by means of 
Native Councils, and thus be assisted in 
the difficult transition from patriarchal 
rule to popular self-government by an 
evolutionary process and not by a revo- 
lutionary coup. This policy is expounded 
by Professor E. H. Brookes in the able 
and illuminating volume History of Na- 
tive Policy in South Africa. 

The small body of liberal opinion that 
favours equal suffrage rights for the 
black, white, and coloured is limited in 
size and is likely to remain so for some 
time to come.
