Most wants of the average person can be secured whenever there is need of 
such things. That is why so many people say or believe that if they have the 
money, they can get what they want, when they want it. But it is quite different 
with insurance protection. That is one need that will not come within the pur- 
view of the old adage, ‘We'll cross that bridge when we get to it”’.

No one can secure a fire insurance policy or coverage when a building is on 
fire. Neither can a ship owner cover his ship and cargo with marine insurance 
when the vessel is sinking on the deep. That is why all sensible people carry 
insurance at all times on their property and goods, and on the most valuable 
thing on the face of the earth, the human body. 


Ee 


Of course some people do wait until they find their health impaired, and 
then by stealth secure insurance protection; or by concealing their true age, 
when if the true age were known, no insurance could be secured. But such cases, 
though numerous, are no more honorable and right than if such persons put 
their hands into the pockets or tills of someone and extracted money that did not 
belong to them. 


The honorable and sensible thing to do is to secure insurance when in good, 
sound health, and carry it until the time of need. And the best kind of insur- 
ance to have in time of sickness, accident or death is the 3-in-1 Superior Policy, 
issued by the Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc.

THE Crisis 









CRISIS 





HERE were four refugee camps 

at Vicksburg: Camp Hayes, 

Camp Juarez, Camp Louisiana 

and Camp Fort Hill. The lovely hills 

of the National Park, where once the 

Confederate and Union armies were 

camped, made an ideal location high 

above the muddy River and: the little 
town of Vicksburg. 

In Camp Hayes a spreading mag- 
nolia tree opened its waxy blossoms 
over the Red Cross Headquarters tent, 
on the top of the hill. On either side 
in regular rows stretched the brown 
tents sheltering twelve hundred white 
refugees: one family to a tent; a cot 
to each member of the family; and 
as many blankets as necessary. While 
among them were a few owners and 
occasional small merchants or me- 
chanics, the majority of these refugees 
were tenant-farmers or share-croppers 
on large plantations, in a state of per- 
petual indebtedness to the planter. 
Being white they had recourse to law 
to defend themselves and were ac- 
corded a certain consideration and re- 
spect. Economically they were little 
or no better off than the Negroes on 
the same plantations, which increased 
their race hatred, as well as their re- 
sentment toward the planters. “They 
treat us like niggers”, they remarked 
bitterly, indicating the lowest inhu- 
manity. Many of them were sturdy, 
hard working citizens, struggling to 
get ahead enough to buy their few 
acres. ‘Those who were already own- 
ers were burdened by heavy mort- 
gages. Among them were some who 
were known in their local communi- 
ties as desperadoes, bragging of the 
number of murders they had com- 
mitted. “I killed five before break- 
fast once,” one of these drawled. 
“Didn’t hurt my appetite none.” Yes, 
he was acquitted —the jury valued 
their own lives. 

Side by side with these were the 
tents of pious members of the Church 
of Christ, who held religious meetings 
in a tent on the hill every afternoon 
and evening for nearly three months. 
These added much to the enjoyment 
of these refugees. ‘I love this place,” 
one of them said; “it’s just like a 
camp-meeting.” 

About two miles from Camp Hayes 
on another hill in the same great park, 
was the colored camp Louisiana, six 
thousand strong, several families to a 
tent, cots only for the aged and ill, 
but as many brown army blankets as 
needed. Camp Juarez, where four 
hundred Mexicans found safety, was

located at the foot of a hill, just be- 
low the National Cemetery, in a con- 
venient rustic pavilion, large enough 
for the whole camp. Camp Fort Hill 
numbered at least six thousand col- 
ored refugees, and commanded on one 
side a view of the River, with tree 
tops rising from it at intervals, on 
the other the roofs of the town. In 
this camp eight or nine families to a 
tent were common and cots were few. 

The most impressive thing about 
these camps was the incredible melan- 
choly of the colored refugees. There 
was no laughter, no music, no Negro 
light-heartedness. They sat in silent 
apathy, or talked in low tones. They 
had come from scenes of horror, many 
of them, greater than any white refu- 
gees knew, as the helplessness of the 
Negro in Mississippi exceeds anything 
known to whites. One woman stood 
all night waist-deep in rising water. 
A few rods away, but out of sight, 
her husband screamed for help. He 
could not be reached. After a while 
his screams stopped. In the morning 
there was no sign of him. Two young 
‘irls went to the Red Cross tent day 
after day to ask for news of their 
brother who had been taken to work 
on the levee at Greenville. At last 
the news came: he had been found 
drowned near the levee. The girls 
turned without a word and went in 
silence to their own tent, tears stream- 
ing down their faces. There was no 
sound of mourning, no lamentation 
in the camp. The calamity of all 
was too great for that easy expres- 
sion. 


HE refugee camps were maintained 

by the American National Red 
Cross. That is, theRed Cross furnished 
the supplies, paid the bills and decided 
all matters of policy. The Red Cross 
nurses and doctors held a daily clinic. 
One or two Red Cross workers sta- 
tioned in each camp attended to such 
matters as registering refugees, issu- 
ing passes to leave camp, giving out 
clothing, blankets, etc., and arranging 
transportation for refugees leaving to 
return home. The last item was the 
most difficult, especially in the colored 
camps. In the white camps ‘trans- 


portation on the river boats was issued 
io individual refugees at their request. 
All that was necessary was for the 
refugee to establish the fact that he 
had a place to live—that his house 
was out of the water or that friends 
or relatives on dry land would take 
him in. Passes were even issued fre- 
quently to men with families to go 
to their homes in order to find out 
what conditions were and get their 
places in order before returning to 
camp and taking their families back 
with them. Sometimes they found 
conditions so hopeless that they re- 
turned to camp immediately and 
waited a few weeks then went back 
on another scouting trip. But where- 
as the transportation issued to white 
refugees, whether owners or share- 
croppers, was on an individual basis, 
with the Negroes the situation was 
quite different. A very large propor- 
tion of the colored refugees were from 
the big cotton plantations of Wash- 
ington County, one hundred and fifty 
miles and more from single plantations. 
In this case the planter sent or brought 
in a list of the names of “his niggers” 
and transportation for them was given 
to him. These Negroes were given 
no choice in the matter. When the 
planter came to take them home with 
them, home they went. The only way 
to avoid this was by slipping out of 
camp at night and taking refuge with 
colored people in Vicksburg. This 
they frequently did, as is shown by 
the fact that, after the camps were 
closed, the files showed over 3,000 Ne- 
groes “registered but not in camp”. 
Probably the number of “runaways” 
was much larger, as many of those 
actually in camp were never registered 
and their escape was relatively easy. 
By far the majority of the Negroes 
were share-croppers, held in perpetual 
peonage by the planter. The system 
is to advance credit at the plantation 
Store, the amount of indebtedness to 
be subtracted from the amount due 
the tenant when the crop is in. The 
crop is never large enough to cancel 
the indebtedness which increases year 
by year. By Mississippi law, how- 
ever, any disaster such as a flood which 
destroys the crop automatically can- 
cels the indebtedness of the tenant to 
the landlord, so that the planter has 
no legal right to hold the tenant. 
Probably most of the tenants do not 
know of this fact. The objection they 
had to returning to the home planta- 
tion was made clear when the Red 
Cross announced that on a definite 


5 














































































date in June the colored camp would 
be evacuated, all refugees to be re- 
turned to the plantations from which 
they came. That night the colored 
refugees took to the hills like fright- 
ened rabbits, and, in spite of the best 
efforts of the National Guard, many 
of them got safely away. 

T should be understood that the 

enforced return of refugees to the 
planters against the will of the former 
was not according to the official Red 
Cross policy and, as has been stated, 
was not done in the case of white 
refugees. Official instructions defi- 
nitely stated that no refugee was to 
be forced to return to a planter. How- 
ever, transportation was only furnished 
to their homes—that is, to the place 
where they were living at the time 
of the flood. After the planter had 
sent for “his people” the refugees were 
notified and told to be ready to go on 
a definite date. If they protested they 
were asked what alternative plan they 
could suggest. Usually they had none, 
or a vague plan to go to some rela- 
tives. This was allowed only if they 
could show letters from the relatives 
stating that they were able to receive 
and care for them for am indefinite 
period. Needless to say, very few of 
them cotld produce such letters. The 
refugee was next told that the Red 
Cross would not furnish maintenance 
for him after it was possible for him 
to return home. Neither would he 
be allowed to leave camp without a 
definite destination approved by the 
Red Cross. If he still remained in 
camp, as he well knew, he would be 
“in bad” with the Red Cross and sub- 
ject to special abuse by the National 
Guard. The result was that he ended 
by expressing his willingness to zo 
with his planter; or else ran away 
from camp at night. 

The Red Cross defense is that they 
did not create the social conditions in 
the South and it is not their function 
to reform them. All they can be ex- 
pected to do is to relieve temporary 
suffering due to the disaster and leave 
the victim in the same position in which 
he was when the flood came. Any- 
thing more than this is not only con- 


sidered beyond the scope of the or-- 


ganization but is held by most Red 
Cross workers as definitely bad work, 
almost amounting to mis-use of funds. 
Anyone familiar with this work has 
frequently heard the words, “Why, 
he is better off than he was before the 
disaster”, in a tone of horror that in- 
dicated more than the words just how 
reprehensible this was. It does not 
occur to the average Red Cross worker, 
apparently, that it is impossible to 
keep hands off from existing social in- 
stitutions. They must, whether they 
wish or not, either strengthen or 
weaken them. Like many family wel- 


6 





fare agencies, their instinctive stand 
is made with the strong, the power- 
ful, rather than on the side of the 
weak. 

Cooperating with the Red Cross 
were many agencies, the important one 
in the camps being the National Guard. 
Their work was to maintain order 
and sanitation, to police the camps 
and supervise the actual labor which, 
except in Camp Hayes, was done by 
the refugees. In the white camp the 
kitchen work and rougher tasks were 
done by Negroes from Camp Louisi- 
ana. They were unpaid with the ex- 
ception of three men who were given 
fifty cents a day. The Guardsmen 
assigned all work to refugees at their 
own discretion and forced them to do 
it, by any means they saw fit. They 
also did sentry duty—no one was al- 
lowed to enter or leave camp without 
a pass. They had, in addition, to 
load the trucks with conscripted Ne- 
gro labor which was sent out each 
morning to local enterprises in need 
of labor. At first this labor was un- 
paid but on May tenth an order was 
issued by General Green requiring all 
agencies desiring labor details from 
the refugee camps to submit their re- 
quest twelve hours before the labor 
was desired, stating the number of 
Negroes wanted, the time when they 
were wanted, the time they would be 
returned to camp, and the rate of pay. 
After that date the men were paid 
from a dollar and a quarter to a dol- 
lar and a half a day for a ten hour 
day. They were rounded up early 
each morning by the Guardsmen as- 
signed to that task. Only a certifi- 
cate from the doctor stating that a 
man was too ill to work excused him. 
Such a certificate could be obtained 
by going to the clinic, which was held 
at ten o'clock each morning, for ex- 
amination by the physician. By ten 
o'clock practically all the men in camp 
had gone to work. Those who were 
on the night shift were able to attend 
the clinic by sacrificing their sleep. 
Only the two colored nurses to whom 
they went for medicine knew the num- 
ber of men who went to work each 
morning with temperatures as high as 
104 degrees, or gripped by a malarial 
chill. At the Refuge Ware House, 
which employed the largest detail. of 
conscripted labor, they were put at the 
heaviest Lind of work and were bru- 
tally ill-treated. “It ain’t the work,” 
said one of these refugees, “we’s will- 
ing to work. It’s the kickin’ and 
cursin’ makes it so hard.” 


NE of the hardest tasks of the 
Guard was that of getting out the 
labor detail night and morning. In 
spite of the fact that those who re- 
mained in camp were put at work 
there, cleaning up, putting up or tak- 








ing down tents, filling in trenches, etc., 
and that they were paid for outside 
work, it was increasingly difficult to 
get the required number. Force had 
to be resorted to. As the guardsmen 
were of course armed with guns and 
pistols which they showed entire will- 
ingness to use it should have been com- 
paratively simple, but on numerous oc- 
casions Negroes were taken down the 
hill and beaten into submission before 
they could be loaded on the truck and 
sent to their day’s labor. Reports of 
these beatings were made to General 
Green by colored citizens in Vicks-

Subject: Reported Whipping of Refu- 
gees in Camp Fort Hill. 
To : The Commanding General, 


Vicksburg, Miss. 

1. I have investigated the above mat- 
ter and find that on Friday morning, 
May 21st, 1927, it having been previously 
reported that refugees were leaving camp 
early in the morning in order to avoid 
being called on the different details neces- 
sary about the camp, the enlisted men in 
charge of details on this morning sent 
some men out beyond the guard posts 
for the purpose of catching any refugees 
leaving without authority, or a pass. On 
this particular morning they caught in 
the neighborhood of 25 negro men slip- 
ping out of camp; some of the negroes 
say that they counted 21 in the bunch. 
I have interviewed some of these negroes 
and attach hereto their statements, taken 
on last Monday. Some of the others I 


THe Crisis 




















a of oe & tae

a FY CP 










have talked to but at the time they were 
just leaving on the truck with a detail 
of laborers and I could not reduce their 
statements to writing and have them 
sign them. Each of the negroes, however, 
made practically the same statement. 

2. It would appear from what the 
negroes say about the matter, that they 
were slipping out of camp; some admit 
for the purpose of avoiding the labor 
details and the work. to be done about 
the camp, and some offering excuses as 
to why they were leaving through the 
bushes at 4:30 A. M. It is my opinion, 
from what the negroes say, that they 
were caught slipping out of camp, and 
were taken under the hill and whipped, 
the men using a strap taken off of one 
of the rifles. 

3. It must be admitted, of course, that 
such measures should not be used by the 
soldiers, and it is my opinion that no 
such thing will ever occur again, and 
that had the men taken the time to con- 
sider, it would not have happened on this 
occasion, but if one is familiar with 
conditions, and considers for a moment 
what an undertaking it is for thirty odd 
soldiers to handle some five thousand 
people, then the enormity of the crime 
must be diminished, for under all condi- 
tions some means of discipline must be 
provided. No guns were drawn or held 
on the negroes, and no force was used 
to intimidate them, or force them to sub- 
mit to the whipping. It was adminis- 
tered simply as a means of breaking up 
the practice of leaving camp without 
passes, and without any criminal intent. 

4. None of the negroes reported the 
matter, and each of them state that they 
desire to prefer no charges, but desire 
that the matter be dropped. 


STATEMENT OF JOHN BUTLER, 
Greenville, Miss. 


On last Friday morning about 8 o’clock 
] was going down the Hill to Quarter 
Boat to get some clothes. I met some 
soldiers and they caught us and carried 
us up there and whipped us with a gun 
strap. I had been on night duty and was 
relieved when caught. 

I have not complained to any person 
about the affair. I did not have a pass 
to go out of camp and I was not going 
by the regular road. 

The morning after this affair an- 
other negro was severely beaten. The 
refugee was from another camp and 
protested against being sent to work 
by officers not in charge of his own 
camp. The matter being reported an 
investigation was ordered, which re- 
sulted in these statements made by the 
Captain, the Sergeant who adminis- 
tered the beating and the Negro girl 
who witnessed the alteration: 

Investigation reveals that around 5:22 
A. M., May 22, 1927, that the men get- 
ting out the morning labor detail found 
the said negro at a refugee negro girl’s 
tent in area I. The negro was appar- 
ently a Ft. Hill refugee attempting to 
keep from going out to work. He said 
to Sergeant Hamlin and to negro girl 
that he wasn’t going out to work, that 


January, 1928 


he didn’t have to work. He was told 
tc get on the truck. He finally gave so 
much sass and bray talk before the other 
laborers that he was taken over in the 
ravine and given a lashing. 

This information was obtained from 
the negro girl and from Sergeant Ham- 
lin. 

W. K. McWIttiams, 
Capt., 106th Engrs. 


HE use of violence on the part of 

guardsmen toward Negro refugees 
was thoroughly established in the early 
days of the disaster. The work on 
the Vicksburg levee was entirely the 
enforced labor of Negro refugees, su- 
perintended by armed guardsmen. 
This was done by order of General 
Green, the labor to be brought from 
the colored refugee camps. There 
were many thousands of refugees in 
the town of Vicksburg who did not 
go into the camps. The entire colored 
population of the town lent their homes 
to the utmost capacitv for the use of 
refugees, so that the tiniest cabin was 
filled to over-flowing. As long as 
these people were able to maintain 
themselves it -was difficult to obtain 
their free labor However, a way to 
do so was found. 

A cafeteria was maintained for the 
purpose of feeding the Negro labot 
brought from camp. Other refugees 
were not to be allowed to enter. In 
practice the soldier in charge allowed 
the town refugees to enter and be fed, 
then, as they were about to leave, they 
were seized and forced to join the la- 
bor detail. In at least one instance 
this practice led to shooting the refu- 
gee who objected to being coerced. 
The official report of this shooting is 
as follows: 


HEADQUARTERS, RELIEF ExPEDITION, 
Mississtpp1 NATIONAL GUARD. 
Vicksburg, Miss. 


May 3, 1927. 
Mayor W. J. Hosley, 
Vicksburg, Miss. 
Dear Sir: In re: Shooting of Dunbar, 
a negro flood refugee. 

This shooting occurred on May Ist, 
1927, near A. & V. freight office. Dunbar 
was shot in the stomach and arm but 
has good chances for recovery. He was 
shot by Private Herbert K. Moore, 122nd 
Motor Transport Corps. Private Moore 
reported to Police Headquarters and was 
released on bond. Dunbar was sent to 
a hospital immediately after being shot. 

Private Moore was forced to shoot 
Dunbar to save his own life. Dunbar 
attacked him with a tent pin, struck 
him a severe blow across the face and 
attempted to take his pistol, threatening 
to take Private Moore’s life all the time. 
Private Moore took only such action 
as was necessary to protect his own life. 

The facts of this affair have been 
given to Judge W. W. Ramsey, Police 
Justice, in detail. As soon as it is de- 
termined whether Dunbar will recover 
private Moore will be arraigned before 


Judge Ramsey on a proper charge so 
that there may be a judicial determina- 
tion of his guilt or innocence. Of course, 
this can not be done until it is certain 
that Dunbar will recover or until he 
dies. 

Judge Ramsey agrees that Private 
Moore should be allowed to continue at 
large under bond already given until time 
for his trial. 


Very respectfully yours, 
Captain, J. A. G. 


It will be noticed that the only man 
interviewed “in this “investigation” 
was Private Moore. At the time this 
report was made, although the’ Cap- 
tain does not state this, it was uncer- 
tain that Dunbar would recover. In 
case he did not this left nothing to 
contradict the self-defense story; while 
if he did recover no serious charge 
would be brought. 


T is doubtful whether a self-defense 

plea would have served in the 
case of Matilda Heslip, a colored wo- 
man at Camp Fort Hill, had she shot 
the soldier who struck her with a stick 
the exact size of the one with which 
Dunbar struck the guardsman. Her 
offense was the unforgivable one of 
impudence. It happened that a sol- 
dier was leaving on the noon train 
and he told Matilda Heslip to wash 
and iron his clothes before he went. 
She objected that it would be impos- 
sible to get the garments dried and 
ironed in that time. The man ordered 
her to dry them in the kitchen before 
the stove. Her attempt to do this 
led to a row with the kitchen forces. 
The sergeant was sent for to settle 
the dispute. The testimony follows: 


On May 12, about 11 A. M., at Fort 
Hill, a negro woman named Matilda 
Heslip was raising a disturbance in the 
kitchen and the negroes working there 
could not quiet her. Sergeant McIntyre 
of “C” 106th Engrs. was sent for by the 
kitchen force to quiet the fuss. He found 
upon entering that the woman had 
washed some clothes and was trying to 
dry them before the stove. This oc- 
curred at the time when it was necessary 
to have room for the preparation of the 
noon meal. The woman had been asked 
to move by the kitchen force but would 
pay no attention to them. Sergeant Mc- 
Intyre ordered her to move and she re- 
tused. He left to get a cot stick with 
which to protect himself if it became 
necessary when the woman ran, leaving 
the clothes scattered about the kitchen. 
Sergeant McIntyre ordered her to return 
and get the clothes. She refused and also 
advised him that no one could make her 
do it. Her language was so insulting 
and impudent that it was necessary to 
use force in order to preserve discipline 
among the colored refugees so necessary 
to a successful handling of these 
camps. The woman was struck about 
the arm with a cot stick and she was 
also hit on the head. It was necessary 
to take three stitches (Turn to page 26)

O me as a child “J” seemed an 

unsociable letter that turned its 
back upon the rest of the alphabet. 
And “J” begins Janus, as the ancients 
called the two-faced god believed to 
guard the beginning and the end of 
affairs. January was named for him. 
A good name for the first month of 
the year! And people are really wise 
to make resolutions at the opening of 
January, if only they would abide by 
the plans laid out! 

I used to begin the first diary entry 
with remarkable promises for the fu- 
ture. But the year’s record would 
close rather thin with accounts of ful- 
fillment by telling of a hardy bit of 
green found gleaming under Decem- 
ber ice. For there is something in- 
teresting in discovering the little tufts 
that will not die—catnip and bits of 
mullein and wild strawberry—these 
live on with hosts of other plants and 
animals that bravely wait for spring. 


WONDER if winter is bitter to 

them. How joyous the cold days 
seemed in my childhood! We used 
to ride in sleighs to school. The run- 
ners would whistle gaily over the com- 
pact snow, the bells would jingle as 
the horses hurried on, their beards 
hung with little icicles, their nostrils 
steaming. At the end of the rides the 
horses would be in a perspiration be- 
cause of the heavier fur of their win- 
ter coats, and one would have to 
blanket them that they might not 
catch cold. 

Sometimes boys afoot would fasten 
their sleds to the sleighs and be whirled 
merrily onward too. The winter 
months were short to us as children, 
short and so jolly. We could realize 
the delight of crying, “A Happy New 
Year”!

To Make a Butterfly 


T swings from a little tree, heigh-ho! 
It swings from a bough where wet 
winds blow, 
Yet I’ve this belief, 
The little brown leaf 
Is keeping some worm dry 
To make a butterfly! 





Snipper 
NIPPER was nothing in the world 
but one particular blast of north 
wind so I see no need of writing para- 
graph upon paragraph about Snipper. 
I shall tell it quite briefly. 

He came down from the north 
every fall, and got after overcoats and 
any scattered leaves that were not too 
damp to be blown. He also delighted 
in dislodging hats, violently. William 
Randolph was going to a party and 
Snipper took off the poor boy’s cap. 
Hat removing as we stated was no 
new prank for Snipper, but in the 
case of William Randolph’s hat there 
was something rather remarkable. 

The boy chased and Snipper pur- 
sued it all the more desperately, till 
the little plaid bit of head gear was 
lost to view. This is the unusual fea- 
ture in my story, since people gener- 
ally recover wind-chased property, 
though they cannot always use it 
again. But William Randolph’s hat 
was completely gone and on New 
Year’s Day as he journeyed to a party. 

Now! 


ILLIAM RANDOLPH chased 
his hat from the candy shop 
threshold to a hedge where he hoped 


it might get caught, but the hat went 
over the hedge. And when William 
had entered through a gate and got- 
ten to the other side of the privet 
clumps he found no hat. Violet was 
at the New Year party too, Violet 
with the marvelous black curls. Surely 
she was smiling at some one now. But 
William Randolph could not find his 
hat. 

It is painful to write of the joy that 
Snipper was having over William’s 
trouble. He raced gaily on, driving 
forward some people, beating others 
boldly in the face, rioting, shaking halt 


open doors, finding strange bits of . 


paper and trash. In joy he tore 
through the village streets to a great 


old deserted barn back of an empty © 


cottage. He jerked the door wide 
open and rushed in. 

The lonesome old barn let its rusty 
hinges draw the door back to the posi- 
tion that it had held for years and 
then—Snipper was a prisoner at last. 
The solitary barn was glad to have 
excitement within it. First the horses 
went, then the grain and the hay and 
the fodder and even the mice and 
sparrows followed the grain away. 
How fortunate that a bold lively gale 
had come rushing in to spend the New 

‘ear afternoon! Yes, the old barn 
would keep Snipper there as long as 
possible. 


HEN the heavy door had banged 

something had rushed in wild 
alarm from behind the barn, a dog, 
the same dog that had laid on the 
other side of the hedge as William 
Randolph’s hat landed there, and had 
hurried with it to a hiding place. If 
there had been snow on the ground 
William might have traced the dog, 
Swift. But the snow did not fall till 
midnight. 

However William had no need to 
chase Swift in the end, for the dog 
ran straight from behind the barn into 
his pursuer’s path as William was 
starting homeward, discouraged. 

And back to Snipper, that boister- 
ous blast of the great North Wind. 
The North Wind discovered the skies 
clouding and hastened back homeward 
with all his puffs and gales except 
Snipper. The air became still and 
down fell the velvety flakes of snow. 
Snipper perished in the closed barn 
while William Randolph hurricd on 
to the New Year party and met Violet 
there.

The Purple Flower 


A Prize Play by MARITA O. BONNER 


Time: The Middle-of-Things-as- 
They-are. (Which means the End- 
of-Things for some of the characters 
and the  Beginning-of-Things for 
others. ) 

Place: Might be here, there or any- 
where—or even nowhere. 

Characters: Sundry White Devils. 
(They must be artful little things with 
soft wide eyes such as you would ex- 
pect to find in an angel. Soft hair that 
flops around their horns. Their horns 
glow red all the time—now with blood 
—now with eternal fire—now with 
deceit—now with unholy desire. They 
have bones tied carefully across their 
tails to make them seem less like tails 
and more like mere decorations. They 
are artful little things full of artful 


movements and artful tricks. They 
are artful dancers too. You are 
amazed at their adroitness. Their 


steps are intricate. You almost lose 
your head following them. Sometimes 
they dance as if they were men—with 
dignity—erect. Sometimes they dance 
as if they were snakes. They are art- 


ful dancers on the Thin-Skin-of- 
Civilization. 
The Us’s: They can be as white as 


the White Devils, as brown as the 
earth, as black as the center of a poppy. 
They may look as if they were some- 
thing or nothing. 

Setting: The stage is divided hori- 
zontally into two sections, upper and 
lower, by a thin board. The main 
action takes place on the upper stage. 
The light is never quite clear on the 
lower stage; but it is bright enough for 
you to perceive that sometimes the ac- 
tion that takes place on the upper stage 
is duplicated on the lower. Sometimes 
the actors on the upper stage get too 
vociferous — too violent—and_ they 
crack through the boards and they lie 
twisted and curled in mounds. There 
are any number of mounds there, all 
twisted and broken. You look at them 
and you are not quite sure whether 
you see something or nothing; but you 
see by a curve that there might lie a 
human body. There is thrust out a 
white hand—a yellow one—one brown 
—a black. The Skin-of-Civilization 
must be very thin. A thought can 
drop you through it. 

Scene: An open plain. It is 
bounded distantly on one side by No- 
where and faced by a high hill— 
Somewhere. 

Argument: The White Devils live 
on the side of the hill, Somewhere. 
On top of the hill grows the purple 
Flower-of-Life-At-Its-Fullest. This 


flower is as tall as a pine and stands

alone on top of the hill. The Us’s live 
in the valley that lies between No- 
where and Somewhere and spend their 
time trying to devise means of getting 
up the hill. The White Devils live all 
over the sides of the hill and try every 
trick, known and unknown, to keep 
the Us’s from getting to the hill. For 
if the Us’s get up the hill, the Flower- 
of-Life-at-Its-Fullest will shed some of 
its perfume and then and there they 
will be Somewhere with the White 
Devils. The Us’s started out by 
merely asking permission to go up. 
They tilled the valley, they cultivated 
it and made it as beautiful as it is. 
They built roads and houses even for 
the White Devils. They let them 
build the houses and then they were 
knocked back down into the valley. 

Scene: When the curtain rises, the 
evening sun is shining bravely on the 
valley and hillside alike. 

The Us’s are having a siesta beside 
a brook that runs down the Middle 
of the valley. As usual they rest with 
their backs toward Nowhere and their 
faces toward Somewhere. The White 
Devils are seen in the distance on the 
hillside. As you see them, a song is 
borne faintly to your ears from the 
hillside. 

The White Devils are saying: 

“You stay where you are! 
We don’t want you up here! 
If you come you'll be on par 
With all we hold dear. 

So stay—stay—stay— 

Yes stay where you are!” 

The song rolls full across the val- 
ley. 
A little runty Us: “Hear that, 
don’t you?” 

Another Us (lolling over on his 
back and chewing a piece of grass): 
“T ain’t studying "bout them devils. 
When I get ready to go up that hill 
—I’m going! (He rolls over on his 
side and exposes a slender brown body 
to the sun.) “Right now, I’m going 
to sleep.” (And he forthwith snores.) 

An old dark brown lady who has 
been lying down rises suddenly to her 
knees in the foreground. She gazes 
toward the hillside and speaks: “T’ll 
never live to see the face of that 
flower! God knows I worked hard 
to get Somewhere though. I’ve washed 
the shirt off of every one of them 
White Devils’ backs!” 


A Young Us: “And got a slap in 
the face for doing it.” 

Old Lady: “But that’s what the 
Leader told us to do. ‘Work,’ he said. 
‘Show them you know how.’ As if 
two hundred years of slavery had not 
showed them!” 

Another Young Us: “Work doesn’t 
do it. The Us who work for the 
White Devils get pushed in the face 
—down off of Somewhere every night. 
They don’t even sleep up there.” 

Old Lady: “Something’s got to be 
done though! The Us ain’t got no 
business to sleep while the sun is shin- 
ing. They'd ought to be up and work- 
ing before the White Devils get to 
some other tricks. 

Young Us: “You just said work 
did not do you any good! What’s 
the need of working if it doesn’t get 
you anywhere? What’s the use of 
boring around in the same hole like a 
worm? Making the hole bigger to 
stay in?” 

(There comes up the road a clatter 
of feet and four figures, a middle-aged 
well-browned man, a lighter-browned 
middle-aged woman, a medium light 
brown girl, beautiful as a browned 
peach and a slender, tall, bronzy 
brown youth who walks with his head 
high. He touches the ground with 


‘his feet as if it were a velvet rug and 


not sun-baked, jagged rocks.) 

Old Lady (addressing the Older 
Man): “Evenin’, Average. I was 
just saying we ain’t never going to 
make that hill.” 

Average: “The Us will if they get 
the right leaders.” 

The Middle-aged Woman—Cor- 
nerstone (speaks): “Leaders! Lead- 
ers! They’ve had good ones looks like 
to me.” 

Average: 
anywhere!” 

Cornerstone: “But that is not their 
fault! If one of them gets up and 
says, ‘Do this’, one of the Us will 
sneak up behind him and knock him 
down and stand up and holler, ‘Do 
that’, and then he himself gets knocked 
down and we still sit in the valley and 
knock down and drag out!” 

A Young Us: “Yeah! Drag Us 
out, but not White Devils.” (aside). 

Old Lady: “It’s the truth Corner- 
stone. They say they going to meet 
this evening to talk about what we 
ought to do.” 

Average: ‘What is the need of so 
much talking?” 

Cornerstone: “Better than not talk- 
ing! Somebody might say something 
after while.”

(The Young Girl—Sweet—who 
just came up, speaks): “I want to 
talk too!” 


Average: ‘What can you talk 
about ?” 

Sweet: “Things! Something, 
father!” 


(The Young Man—Finest Blood— 
who is with them speaks): “Vl speak 
too.” 

Average: “Oh you all make me 
tired! ‘Talk—talk—talk—talk! And 
the flower is still up on the hillside!” 

Old Lady: “Yes and the White 
Devils are still talking about keeping 
the Us away from it, too.” 

(A drum begins to beat in the dis- 
tance. All the Us stand up and shake 
off their sleep. The drummer, a short 
black, determined looking Us, appears 
around the bushes beating the drum 
with strong, vigorous jabs that make 
the whole valley echo and re-echo with 
rhythm. Some of the Us begin to 
dance in time to the music. ) 

Average: “Look at that! Dancing!! 
The Us will never learn to be sen- 
sible!” 

Cornerstone: 
Well!!” 

(The Us all congregate at the cen- 
tre front. Almost naturally, the Young 
Us range on one side, the Old Us on 
the other. Cornerstone sits her plump 
brown self comfortably in the centre 
of the stage.) 

(An Old Us tottering with age and 
blind comes toward her): “What's it 
this time, chillun? Is it day yet? Can 
you see the road to that flower? 

Average: “Oh you know we ain’t 
going to get up there! No use worry- 
ing!” 

Cornerstone (to Old Man): “No 
it’s not day! It is still dark. It is 
night.” (For the sun has gone and 
purple blackness has lain across the 
Valley. Somehow, though, you can 
see the shape of the flower on top of 
Somewhere. Lights twinkle on the 
hill.) 

Old Man (speaking as if to him- 
self): “T’m blind from working— 
building for the White Devils in the 
heat of the noon-day sun and I’m 
weary!” 

Cornerstone: “Lean against me so 
they won’t crowd you.” 

(An old man rises in the back of the 
ranks; his beard reaches down to his 
knees but he springs upright. He 
speaks): “IT want to tell you all some- 
thing! The Us can’t get up the road 
unless we work! We want to hew 
and dig and toil!” 

A Young Us: “You had better sit 
down before someone knocks you 
down! They told us that when your 
beard was sprouting.” 

Cornerstone (to Youth): “Do not 
be so stupid! Speak as if you had re- 
spect for that beard!”

“They dance well! 


Another Young Us: “We have! 
But we get tired of hearing ‘you must 
work’ when we know the Old Us 
built practically every inch of that hill 
and are yet Nowhere.” 

First Young Us: “Yes, all they got 
was a rush down the hill — not a 
chance to take a step up!” 

Cornerstone: “It was not time 
then.” 

(dn Old Man on the back row): 
“Here comes a Young Us who has 
been reading in the books! Here 
comes a Young Us who has been read- 
ing in the books! He’ll tell us what 
the books say about getting Some- 
where.” 

(4 Young Man pushes through the 
crowd. As soon as he reaches the cen- 
tre front, he throws a bundle of books 
and cries): “I’m through! I do not 
need these things! They’re no good!” 

(The Old Man pushes up from the 
back and stands beside him): “You're 
through! Ain’t you been reading in 
the books how to get Somewhere? 
Why don’t you tell us how to get 
there?” 

The Young Man: “I’m through I 
tell you! There isn’t anything in one 
of these books that tells Black Us how 
to get around White Devils.” 

Old Man (softly—sadly): “I 
thought the books would tell us how!” 

Young Man: “No! The White 
Devils wrote the books themselves. 
You know they aren’t going to put 
anything like that in there!” 

Yet another Old Man (throwina 
back his head and calling into the air): 
“Lord! Why don’t you come by here 
and tell us how to get Somewhere?” 

A Young Man (who had been idly 
chewing grass speaks): “Aw, you 
ought to know by now that isn’t the 
way to talk to God!” 

Old Man: “It ain’t! It ain’t! It 
ain’t! It ain’t! Ain’t I been talking 
to God just like that for seventy years? 
Three score and ten years—Amen!” 

The Grass Chewer: “Yes! Three 
score and ten years you been telling 
God to tell you what to do. Telling 
Him! And three score and ten years 
you been wearing your spine double 
sitting on the rocks in the valley too.” 

Old Us: “He is all powerful! He 
will move in his own time!” 

Young Us: “Well, if he is all 
powerful, God does not need you to 
tell Him what to do.” 

Old Us: “Well what’s the need of 
me talkin’ to Him then?” 

Young Us: “Don’t talk so much to 
Him! Give Him a chance! He might 
want to talk to you but you do so 
much yelling in His ears that He can’t 
tell you anything.” 

(There is a commotion in the back 
stage. Sweet comes running to Cor- 
nerstone crying.) 


Sweet: “Oh—oo—!” 

Cornerstone: ‘What is it, Sweet?” 

Sweet: “There’s a White Devil sit- 
ting in the bushes in the dark over 
there! There’s a White Devil sitting 
in the bushes over in the dark! And 
when I walked by—he pinched me!” 

Finest Blood (catching a rock): 
“Where is he, sister?” (He starts to- 
ward the bushes.) 

Cornerstone (screaming): ‘Don’t 
go after him son! They will kill you 
if you hurt him!” 

Finest Blood: “1 don’t care if they 
do. Let them. I'd be out of this hole 
then!” 

Average: “Listen to that young 
fool! Better stay safe and sound 
where he is! At least he got some- 
where to eat and somewhere to lay 
his head.” 

Finest Blood: “Yes I can lav my 
head on the rocks of Nowhere.” 

(Up the center of the s:age toils a 
new figure of a square sec middle-aged 
Us. He walks heavily for in each 
hand he carries a heavy bag. As soon 
as he reaches the center front he 
throws the bags down groaning as he 
does so.) 

An Old Man: “’Smatter with you? 
Ain’t them bags full of gold.” 

The New Comer: “Yes, they are 
full of gold!” 

Old Man: “Well why ain’t you 
smiling then? Them White Devils 
can’t have anything no better!” 

The New Comer: “Yes they have! 
They have Somewhere! I tried to do 
what they said. I brought them 
money, but when I brought it to them 
they would not sell me even a spoon- 
ful of dirt from Somewhere! I’m 
through!” 

Cornerstone: ‘Don’t be through. 
The gold counts for something. It 
must!” 

(An Old Woman cries aloud in a 
quavering voice from the back): “Last 
night I had a dream.” 

A Young Us: “Dreams? Excuse 
me! I know I’m _ going now! 
Dreams!!” 

Old Lady: “I dreamed that I saw 
a White Devil cut in six pieces—head 
here, (pointing), body here—one leg 
here—one there—an arm _ here—an 
arm there.” 

An Old Man: “Thank God! It’s 
time then!” 

Average: “Time for what? Time 
to eat? Sure ain’t time to get Some- 
where!” 

Old Man walking forward: “It’s 
time! It’s time! Bring me an iron 
pot!” 

Young Us: “Aw don’t try any con- 
juring! 

Old Man (louder): “Bring me a 
a pot of iron. Get the pot from the 
fire in the valley.” 


THE Crisis

Cornerstone: “Give him the pot!” 
(Someone brings it up immediately). 
Old Man (walking toward pot 
slowly): “Old Us! Do you hear me. 
Old Us that are here do you hear me?” 
(All the Old Us cry in chorus): 
“Yes, Lord! We hear you! We hear 


you!” 
' Old Man (trying louder and 
louder): “Old Us! Old Us!! Old 


Us that are gone, Old Us that are 
dust do you hear me?” 

(His voice sounds strangely through 
the valley. Somewhere you think you 
hear—as if mouthed by ten million 
mouths through rocks and dust— 
“Yes!—Lord!—We hear you! We 
hear you!”) 

Old Man: “And you hear me— 
give me a handful of dust! Give me 
a handful of dust! Dig down to the 
depths of the things you have made! 
The things you formed with your 
hands and give me a handful of dust!” 

(An Old Woman tottering with the 
weakness of old age crosses the stage 
and going to the pot, throws a hand- 
ful of dust in. Just before she sits 
down again she throws back her head 
and shakes her cane in the air and 
laughs so that the entire valley 
echoes. ) 

A Young Us: ‘“What’s the trou- 
ble? Choking on the dust?” 

Old Woman: “No child! Re- 
joicing !”’ 

Young Us: “Rejoicing over a 
handful of dust?” 

Old Woman: “Yes. A handful 
of dust! Thanking God I could do 
something if it was nothing but make 
a handful of dust!” 

Young Us: “Well dust isn’t 
much!” 

Old Man at the pot: “Yes, it isn’t 
much! You are dust yourself; but 
so is she. Like everything else, 
though, dust can be little or much, 
according to where it is.” 

(The Young Us who spoke sub- 
sides. He subsides so completely that 
he crashes through the Thin-Skin-of- 
Civilization. Several of his group go 
too. They were thinking.) 


Old Man at the pot: “Bring me 
books! Bring me books!” 

Young Us (who threw books 
down): “Here! Take all these! 


I'll light the fire with them.” 
Old Man: “No, put them in the 


pot. 
(Youth does so.) 
Old Man: “Bring me gold!” 


(The Man who brought the Bags of 
Gold): “Here take this! It is just 
as well. Stew it up and make teeth- 
ing rings!!” (He pours it into the 
pot. ) 

Old Man: “Now bring me blood! 
Blood from the eyes, the ears, the 
whole body! Drain it off and bring

me blood!” 

(No one speaks or moves.) 

Old Man: “Now bring me blood! 
Blood from the eyes, the ears, the 
whole body! Drain it off! Bring 
me blood!!” 

(No one speaks or moves.) 

Old Man: “Ah hah, hah! I 
knew it! Not one of you willing to 
pour his blood in the pot!” 

Young Us (facetiously): “How 
you going to pour your own blood 
in there? You got to be pretty far 
gone to let your blood run in there. 
Somebody else would have to do the 
pouring.” 

Old’ Man: “I mean red blood. 
Not yellow blood, thank you.” 
Finest Blood (suddenly): 
my blood!”

pot. ) 

Cornerstone: “OQ no! Not my 
boy! Take me instead!” 

Old Man: “Cornerstone we can- 


not stand without you!” 

An Old Woman: “What you need 
blood for? What you doing anyhow? 
You ain’t told us nothing yet. What's 
going on in that pot?” 

Old Man: “I’m doing as I was 
told to do.” 

A Young Us: 
do anything?” 

Old Man: 
vant.” 

Young Us (who spoke before): 


“Who told you to 
“God. 


I’m His’ ser- 


“God? I haven’t heard God tell you 
anything.” t 
Old Man: “You couldn't hear. 


He told it to me alone.” 

Old Woman: “I believe you. 
Don’t pay any attention to that sim- 
pleton! What God told you to do?” 

Old Man: “He told me take a 
handful of dust—dust from which 
all things came and put it-in’a hard 
iron pot. Pur it in a hard iron pot. 
Things shape best in hard moulds!! 
Put in books that Men learn by. Gold 
that Men live by. Blood that lets 


Men live.” 


Young Us: “What you suppose 
to be shaping? A man?” 
Old Us: “I'm the servant. I can 


do nothing. If I do this, God will 
shape a new man Himself.” 

Young Man: ‘“What’s the things 
in the pot for?” 

Old Man: “To show I can do 
what I’m told.” 


Old Woman: ‘Why does He want 


blood ?” 

Old Man: “You got to give 
blood! Blood has to be let for births, 
to give life.” 

Old Woman: “So the dust wasn’t 
just nothing? Thank God!” 

Youth: “Then the books were not 
just paper leaves? Thank God!” 

The Man of the Gold Bags: “Can 
the gold mean something?” 


Old Man: “Now I need the 


blood.” 

Finest Blood: 
could take mine.” 

Old Man: “Yours!” 

Finest Blood: ‘‘Where else could 
you get it? The New Man must be 
born. The night is already dark. We 
cannot stay here forever. Where else 
could blood come from?” 

Old Man: “Think child. When 
God asked a faithful servant once to 
do sacrifice, even his only child, where 
did God put the real meat for sacri- 
fice when the servant had the knife 
upon the son’s throat?” 

Old Us (in a chorus): 

In the bushes, Lord! 
In the bushes, Lord! 
Jehovah put the ram - 
In the bushes! 


“T told you you 


Cornerstone: “I understand!” 
Finest Blood: ‘What do you 
mean?” 

Cornerstone: ‘Where were you 


going a little while ago? Where 
were you going when your sister cried 
out?” 

Finest Blood: “To the bushes! 
You want me to get the White Devil? 
(He seizes the piece of rock and 
stands to his feet.) 

Old Man: “No! No! Not that 
way. The White Devils are full of 
tricks. You must go differently. 
Bring him gifts and offer them to 
him.” 

Finest Blood: 
give for a gift?” 

Old Man: “There are the pipes of 
Pan that every Us is born with. Play 
on that. Soothe him—lure him — 
make him yearn for the pipe. Even 
a White Devil will soften at music. 
He’ll come out, and he only comes to 
try to get the pipe from you.” 

Finest Blood: “And when _ he 
comes out, I’m to kill him in the dark 
before he sees me? That’s a White 
Devil trick!” 

Old Man: “An Old Us will never 
tell you to play White Devil’s games! 
No! Do not kill him in the dark. 
Get him out of the bushes and say to 
him: ‘White Devil, God is using 
me for His instrument. You think 
that it is I who play on this pipe! 
You think that is I who play upon 
this pipe so that you cannot stay in 
your bushes. So that you must come 
out of your bushes. But it is not I 
who play. It is not I, it is God who 
plays through me—to you. Will you 
hear what He says? Will you hear? 
He says it is almost day, White Devil. 
The night is far gone. A New Man 
must be born for the New Day. 
Blood is needed for birth. Blood is 
needed for the birth. Come out, 
White Devil. It may be your blood

a 


Or of the first, most persistent 
and most effective opponents of 
the Ku Klux Klan in the United 
States, has been the National Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People. This opposition of the 
N. A. A. C. P. to the Klan, even in 
the Klan’s early days, was based upon 
the best of grounds. For beneath ail 
the professions of a desire to protect 
America, to safeguard the chastity of 
womanhood, to uphold morality, the 
N. A. A. C. P. knew that quite dif- 
ferent motives were at work. The 
N. A. A. C. P. knew that the Klan 
movement represented the intention to 
capitalize race hatred ; that creed would 
be incited against creed. and _ race 
against race for the profit of those 
conducting the enterprise; and that 
all the talk about helping to enforce 
the law was merely a cloak to shield 
the movements of those cowards who, 
veiling their faces might commit crimes 
while the organization might disclaim 
any responsibility. 

Fortunately, during the past few 
months, we have had an excellent ex- 
ample of the effects of the domination 
of the Klan. And the demonstration 
is one which justifies to the utmost 
the persistent campaign against the 
Klan and Klan principles carried on 
by the N. A. A. C. P. This labora- 
tory demonstration in what Klan rule 
means has been furnished by the State 
of Alabama, where the Governor and 
other leading officials were members 
of the order and where, in conse- 
quence, there has been a virtual break- 
down of the processes of orderly gov- 
ernment and justice, leaving out of 
discussion ordinary decency and hu- 
manity. 


F the intolerable conditions pre- 
vailing in the State of Alabama, 
we are informed by newspapers pub- 
lished in that state by white men. We

are intormed not only of crimes com- 
mitted by men wearing the regalia of 
this noble band, of women flogged 
and of aged Negroes terrorized for 
the crime of not selling their property 
for a song; but we are told as well 
that occasional grand juries, goaded 
into activity by the desperate state of 
affairs, have handed down indictments, 
naming the Ku Klux Klan by name 
as responsible for the Alabama out- 
rages. The N. A. A. C. P. recentiy 
compiled a pamphlet which it entitled 
“The Recent Record of the Ku Klux 
Klan”. This pamphlet consisted of 
editorials from two Alabama news- 
papers the Montgomery Advertiser 
and the Birmingham News giving in 
detail the record of criminality of 
which the Klan stands arraigned be- 
fore the nation, outside of Alabama 
as well as within the borders of that 
unhappy state. 

The evidence presented in that pam- 
phlet could be added to indefinitely. 
And all of the evidence is furnished 
by Southern white men, editors of 
newspapers of repute. An examina- 
tion of a few of the headlines and 
news reports in Alabama newspapers 
of recent date, which are preserved in 
the files of the N. A. A. C. P. may 
help to fill out the picture of Klan 
protection of the sanctity of woman- 
hood and law enforcement. Take for 
example the following headline, from 
the Montgomery Advertiser, of Octo- 
ber 20: 


Details of Brutal Lashing 
Are Bared by Crenshaw Woman 





Whipped in Home While 
Gang Held Mother in 
Another Room 
It is not necessary to give the entire 





THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 





story written by MHbarold Stephens, 
Stait Correspondent of the Montgom- 
ery Advertiser. Just a brief extract 
will testify to the high regard for 
womanhood of the members of the 
noble Klan: 

“They threw her bodily across the 
bed. Masked men held her feet and 
hands. A Klansman, catching the 
bottom of her skirt, pulled it up around 
her waist. And another, wielding a 
leather strap, dealt blow after blow 
across the naked flesh. 

“After the whipping she was taken 
back to the front room where’ her 
mother had been held in a chair. For 
a number of minutes, a good while, 
she said, the Klansmen remained in 
the room. They still accused her of 
going with the man, and when she 
argued, one of them struck her with 
his hand across the face. 

““Give her some more, she ain’t 
had enough’, a voice in the crowd 
shouted. But the others thought dif- 
ferently and in a little while all left 
the house and climbing into their cars, 
rode away.” 


F Napisy ays case of law enforce- 
ment by the noble Klan is out- 
lined in the following dispatch to the 
New York Times of July 14, 1917, 
reading somewhat as follows:

selling’ their land below its value, are 
occasional, we may refer to the des- 
patch to the New York Herald-Tri- 
bune of October 5, quoting Charles 
C. McCall, Attorney General of the 
State of Alabama. Mr. McCall an- 
nounced that he had evidence sufh- 
cient to indict at least 80 persons for 
flogging in one county, Crenshaw 
County. He said further: “With 
one exception, in every flogging of 
which I now have evidence, the crime 
was committed by men wearing the 
robes of the Knights of the Ku Klux 
Klan. Whether or not these floggings 
were engineered by the order in an 
oficial way, I am not prepared to 
say’. 


HE list of headlines in this con- 
nection could be added to indefi- 
nitely. For example:

Man and Mother Who Own Prop-

to Leave County Before 
November 
To date the Klan-elected Governor of 
Alabama, the Hon. Bibb Graves, has 
said no word concerning the condi- 
tions which are making the name of 
his state a stench in the nostrils of 
the civilized world. Not alone the 
Governor is involved. The Alabama 
Journal and The Times, a newspaper 
published in Montgomery, reports in 
an editorial on November 15, that 
Thomas Heflin, United States Sena- 
tor, did not scruple to appear at a 
meeting and submit to introduction 
to his Montgomery audience by George 
H. Thigpen, state superintendent of 
insurance. Thigpen was appointed 
by the Klan Governor, who despite 


January, 1928 


his oath to tell the truth to a local 
grand jury, later announced that he 
would have refused to give informa- 
tion to that jury concerning a Klan 
officer because to do so would have 
violated his oath to the Klan. This 
klansman, like others, who inveigh 


‘against the danger to America from 


foreign domination, religious or secu- 
lar, are nourishing in our midst a 
form of domination immeasurably 
more menacing and dangerous to 
everything that gives the name of 
America any significance in the world. 


HE brutal ignorance, the crim- 

inality, the cowardice and _ hy- 
pocrisy that inform the Klan and its 
membership have been sufficiently dem- 
onstrated by events not alone in Ala- 
bama, but in Indiana, and the revela- 
tions in Pennsylvania as well. The 
campaign of the N. A. A. C. P. 
against this monster, has been one sim- 
ply and solely of publicity. It has 
been felt that once the nature of the 
Klan and its doings were known, that 
organization must be relegated to the 
criminal and lawless elements in the 
population. Membership in it or sym- 
pathy with it on the part of any self- 
respecting citizen of this country has 
become impossible. 

Its attitude toward the Negro is in- 
dicated not merely by the Alabama 
brutalities, but by the published con- 
fession that the Klan sponsored the 


- bills, introduced last year in a num- 


ber of northern states, which would 
have prohibited marriage between per- 
sons of Negro ancestry and those of 
white ancestry. The N. A. A. C. P. 
was able to defeat every one of these 
bills. But so long as the Klan spirit 
survives in this country such attempts 
will be made. And it behooves every 
colored man and woman in the United 
States, to support the N. A. A. C. P. 
in its fight against the most danger- 
ous threat against the American ideal 
that has ever been made, the un-Amer- 
ican Ku Klux Klan. 
i. J. 5. 


Victory in Gary 
OLORED people in the United 
States need not accept flagrant 

discrimination on the basis of color, if 
they will unite in opposition to it. This 
is conclusively shown by the victory 
against the attempt to segregate colored 
students in the Emerson High School 
of Gary, Indiana. It will be remem- 
bered that Indiana is a state which 
has been dominated by the Ku Klux 


Klan. And that white students of the 


Emerson High School in Gary went 
on “strike” to bring about the exclu- 
sion from their school of the colored 
students who had been studying there. 
And that the city council abjectly bow- 
ing to this mob expression of the Jim 


Crow spirit passed an ordinance ap- 
propriating $15,000 for a “temporary”. 
building to house the colored students. 
All this happened late in September. 

At this point the N. A. A. C. P. 
stepped in. The President of the 
Gary branch, John W. Russell, re- 
tained colored attorneys to fight the 
attempted Jim Crowing of the col- 
ored students. Mass meetings were 
held and William Pickens, Field Sec- 
retary of the N. A. A. C. P. went 
to Gary to help organize the fight. 
The Board of Directors in meeting 
in the National Office of the Associa- 
tion appropriated $500 to be used in 
this struggle for the American prin- 
ciple of equal opportunity and fair 
treatment regardless of color in Amer- 
ican schools. R. L. Bailey, of In- 
dianapolis, was asked as_representa- 
tive of the National Office, to cooper- 
ate with the four attorneys retained 
by the Gary branch: Messrs. F. Law- 
rence Anderson, Charles H. Mason, 
C. L. Carroll, and Edward McKinley 


Bacoyn. 


HE attorneys, backed by the solid 

public sentiment of the colored 
population of Gary, led by the able and 
enthusiastic officers of the local N. A. 
A. C. P. branch, went to court and 
procured a restraining order which, 
on November 7, was continued in the 
form of a temporary injunction re- 
straining the city council from spend- 
ing the taxpayers’ money in this fash- 
ion. Hearing on this injunction was 
set for December 12 and it was freely 
predicted by N. A. A. C. P. attor- 
neys that the defendants would never 
let the matter come to court trial be- 
cause they knew the weakness and 
illegality of their position. And, in 
fact, on November 18 a white daily 
in Gary quoted Mayor Floyd E. Wil- 
liams of Gary as saying that he was 
convinced the appropriation of $15,- 
000 for a segregated school was illegal 
and that it would be a waste of money 
to try to combat the injunction pro- 
cured by the'N. A. A. C. P. 

James Weldon Johnson, the Asso- 
ciation’s Secretary, being in Gary, re- 
ported by letter that on the night of 
Monday, November 21, the city coun- 
cil, urged to this action by the Mayor, 
had passed on first and second read- 
ings a resolution rescinding its ap- 
propriation for a segregated school; 
and that there was every likelihood 
that the resolution would finally be 
passed on third reading at the next 
meeting of the Gary city council, the 
first Monday in December. 

During the course of this struggle 
the opposition stopped at nothing in 
order to hinder the N. A. A. C. P. 
in its efforts. Baseless and menda- 
cious charges were even distributed 
throughout the (Turn to page 30)

Stars in Alabama 
By JESSIE FAUSET 
N Alabama 
Stars hang down so low, 
So low they purge the soul 
With their infinity. 
Beneath their holy glance 
Essential good 
Rises to mingle with them 
In that skiey sea. 


At noon 

Within the sandy cotton-field 
Beyond the clay, red road 
Bordered with green, 

A Negro lad and lass 

Cling hand in hand, 

And Passion, hot-eyed, hot-lipped, 
Lurks unseen. 


But in the evening 

When the skies lean down, 
He’s but a wistful boy, 

A saintly maiden she. 

For Alabama stars 

Hang down so low, 

So low they purge the soul 
With their infinity. 





When Sampson Sings 
By J. E, McCALL 


BLACK SAMPSON is a singing man; 
He’s blind and big and strong. 

A steel guitar is in his hands, 
And in his mouth, a song. 


He shuffles up and down the streets, 
Led by a little child; 

His voice is vibrant, deep and loud, 
Like the sea when the winds are wild. 


There’s sunshine, 
tears, 
In the songs black Sampson sings— 


laughter, pain and 


The slave’s sad wail, the warrior’s 
shout, 

And the laughter of rippling springs. 

There’s something in his voice that 


clings, 
Like Ethiopia’s arms, 
Which holds the strength of Pyramids, 
And great Sahara’s charms. 
When Sampson sings he holds the throng 
With the spell of his magic bars, 
Which thrill like the sound of tom-tom 
drums, 
On the Congo, under the stars.

And we perceived as through a storm 
rent sky 

The land of thy creation, form on high. 

Perceived your darksome pines that 
moaned and soared, 

Your wingéd birds whose brilliant colors 
poured 

Like molten gold, 
paths of blue, 

That sank in cool lush notes of forest 
dew. 


through shadowed 


All this we saw as earth’s forbidden 
screen 

Drew back, from vistas seen but in a 
dream; 

And favored us to look upon the one 

Creation, of her treasured god-born son. 

Then lest a mortal know eternal peace, 

Earth snapped a band around her mas- 
terpiece. 


To a Dark Dancer 


ITHIN the shadow of the moon 

you danced, 
Or postured in the light of crystal stars 
Your dark flame-beauty challenging a 


glance, 

You flung a sob-caught laugh and leaped 
afar 

Into the arms of night, with upturned 
face 

That mocked the waning beauty of the 


moon, 

Its fragile curves, which lacked your 
Nile-born grace 

Which made the tom-toms beat, the 
senses swoon. 


You dance no more upon the silvered 
sand 

With streaming midnight hair and pant- 
ing breath, 

But lie in peace while gold and jeweled 
bands 

Adorn your wrists, and silks caress your 
breast; 

For you are dead and even as I wait 

The desert moon has veiled its pale-gold 
face. 


The Mother o’ Dusk and 
Her Babe 
By FENTON JOHNSON 


{ LOOK and that I see appeals to me 

As does the manger Babe to Christian 
man, 

For she who mothered long another’s 
brood 

Upon her lap in rapture holds a child 

That came from deep travail to claim 
her love. 


Upon its lips she prints a deathless kiss 
And holds against her breast its trem- 
bling form 


And through the night she croons a 
strange old song 
That tells the world, “Behold, I have 


my own.” 


For she is mother now, that once was 
such 

A cruel world with jibes derided her 

And asked her, “Where are those you 
brought to light? 

Where all those hopes you said were 
yours to give?” 


I hear this turbaned mother plead, “O 
world, . 

My hopes have shaped themselves in 
flesh o’ brown 

And all my deeds have given light to 
eyes 


That grasp its infant hour of wonder- 
ment. 

Take now my suckling, let it live for 
thee 


And when its manhood breaks its spirit’s 
bound 
It shall defend thee, succour thee and 
love 
The good that through the ages thou 
hast served.” 


And when the child in sleep would close 
its eyes 

This strong young mother lifts with 
tenderness 

This proselyte to all the joys and woes 

An ancient world would give to test its 
own 

And lays it snug within its trundle bed 

And lets the moonlight play upon its 
form. 


To One Who Thinks of Suicide 
BLANCHE TAYLOR DICKINSON 
Som ETIMES it seems that only cow- 


ards live 
With weighted hearts each day; 
It seems braver far to take life up and 
go 
A solitary way. 
It seems a self reliant soul should know 
When life has palled, 
And win applause for surprising God. . . 
Going in. . . uncalled. 


Poor vain, gallant hero, 

If the journey ended at the grave 

I would cheer you . . . or perhaps I'd 
go 

And wear the laurels of the brave. 


But no! I rather choose to stay 

And trust the clouds to blow away. 

I'll blink and peer through fog of doubt 
Until God blows my candle out. . .

OUNTEE CULLEN'S “Carol- 

ing Dusk”, (.Harpers’, $2.50), is 
the fourth anthology of Negro Ameri- 
can poetry to appear in the last five 
years. The others were: James W. 
Johnson’s “Book of American Negro 
Poetry”, (1922); Robert T. Kerlin’s 
“Negro Poets and Their Poems”, 
(1922); and White and Jackson’s 
“Anthology of Verse by American Ne- 
groes”, (1924). It is astounding to 
find so little duplication. Of the poets 
represented in Cullen, twenty-eight are 
not mentioned by Johnson, chiefly be- 
cause they had not begun to write, 
while many of the poems in Cullen are 
later works of the older poets. This 
points to a virility and new birth of 
Negro literature. As the author says: 
“This anthology, by no means offered 
as the anthology of verse by Negro 
poets, is but a prelude, we hope, to 
that fuller symphony which Negro 
poets will in time contribute to the 
national literature and we shall be 
sadly disappointed if the next few years 
do not find this collection entirely out- 
moded”. The editing is delicately and 
discreetly done and the self-written 
biographies add much to its charm. 

Alain Locke and Montgomery 
Gregory have edited “Plays of Negro 
Life”, (Harpers’, $5.00), which sup- 
plies a wide demand. The authors 
were associated in pioneer work in 
dramatics at Howard University some 
years ago. Mr. Locke says in his in- 
troduction: “This anthology garners 
the yield of this experimental and 
ground-breaking decade as far as the 
one-act play is concerned, and in that 
form, which has been the bulk of the 
recent development, presents the worth- 
while repertory of the Negro Theatre 
to date. Here really is a new province 
in our national: literature. From op- 
posite approaches, there has been a not- 
able collaboration between the Negro 
play-wright attempting, on the one 
side, to advance Negro drama as such 
and to provide the talent of the Negro 
actor with a fit vehicle and a native 
medium and, on the other side, the 
quest of modern American realism for 
new material and a deeper, firmer grip 
upon the actualities of American life. 
Half the plays in this volume repre- 
sent one wing of this advance, and 
half, the other”. 

Among the writers represented are 
the white O’Neill, Torrence and 
Green, while among the colored are 
Wilson, Matheus, Spence. Toomer, 
Richardson and Johnson. The editing

skill. 

The fourth edition of Woodson’s 
“Negro in our History”, (The’ Asso- 
ciated Publishers, 1927), is a mighty 
volume of 616 pages; too large by far 
for a school text book, but excellent for 
college and home reference. It has 
become the best handy encyclopedia of 
the Negro in America that one could 
buy. 

Walter Fleming’s history of the 
“Freedmen’s Savings Bank’’, ( Univer- 
sity of North Carolina Press, $2.00), 
is a story of philanthropy and fraud 
told by a man who is no friend of 
Negroes but more than willing to ex- 
pose with dispassionate impartiality 
this disgraceful episode. No Negro 
should be ignorant of these facts. 
Steiner and Brown’s study of the 
“North Carolina Chain Gang” from 
the same press, ($2.00), is an excel- 
lent detailed study of local crime and 
punishment. It is depressing but ought 
to form a basis of intelligent reform. 

W. E. Walling’s “The Mexican 
Question”, (Robins Press, $2.00), de- 
fends this true thesis: “If we inter- 
vene or interfere in Mexico the world 
will conclude that America’s foreign 
policies are to be made henceforth by 
the business interests and that the peo- 
ple have either been mastered or have 
voluntarily abdicated. From that mo- 
ment every nation would be on its 
guard against us and ready to combine 
and use every means to prevent fur- 
ther encroachments and the further 
aggrandizement of American capital. 
Already the economic rapprochement 
of France and Germany is largely ac- 
counted for, as the German Foreign 
Minister Stresemann, pointed out in 
his Nobel Peace Prize speech, by the 
desire of these European nations ‘to de- 
fend themselves from oppression and 
absorption’ by this new extra European 
Power. 

“That way madness lies.”

IN THE MAGAZINES 


LOWLY and surely the ideals of 
the South have seeped into In- 
diana. The Literary Digest for Oc- 
tober 22 ‘carries a short résumé of “The 
Gary School Strike” in which 1400 
white high school students rebelled 
against the presence of 24 colored ones. 
The attitude at Gary, the article states, 
is no better than the heathen caste sys- 
tem of India and should not be treated 
as an insentient prank of school chil- 
dren but as a sinister adult movement 
motivated by the Ku Klux Klan. 
Ernestine Rose writes on “Books 
and the Negro” in the Library Jour- 
nal for November 1. As a study of 
the relation of the library to the col- 
ored reading public, the article is not 
particularly sagacious. The Harlem 
public library, situated in the heart 
of New York City’s black belt, Miss 
Rose says, caters to college students, 
research workers, anthropologists and 
sociologists. The author believes that 
the Negro is helping to settle his prob- 
lem by getting more and better in- 
formation about himself. 


The Yale Review for October car- 
ries “Africa in the 20th Century” by 
Evans Lewin. It is a plea to America 
to put her finger too into the African 
pie and pull out a plum. Africa, says 
Mr. Lewin, especially in the tropical 
portion of the continent, with its vast 
undeveloped resources, stands open for 
the exploitation of the world. 


James Weldon Johnson in Century 
for November discusses the motives be- 
hind “The Practices of Lynching”. 
Lynching, he says, can no longer be 
laid to the alleged criminality of the 
Negro; it is a relic of slavery and is a 
manifestation of the attitude of the 
stronger race toward the group it de- 
sires to control. This has been proven 
time and again when the causes of a 
horrible mob murder have been re- 
vealed. “What did the ‘darky’ do?” 
“My God, man, he went to the front 
door and asked Mrs. Smith for a drink 
of water!” 


The “Our Rostrum” section of the 
Novembér Forum carries “Notes on 
the Negro”, a letter written by Roark 
Bradford, a Southerner who has not 
been influenced by Chapel Hill. Mr. 
Bradford divides the race into three 
groups: the “nigger”, or, in more de- 
fining form, the laborer; the “colored 
person”, who is not insensible to the 
injustices heaped upon him, but who 
is incapable of (Turn to page 30)

THE FAR HORIZON 








THE LITTLE DEAD BLACK- 
BIRD 


HE London Evening News pub- 
lishes an interview with Flor- 
ence Mills’ London manager: 


“Florence Mills, who was born un- 
der a dancing star, will dance no more. 
That sudden, dazzling smile of hers, 
which had always a hint of pathos about 
it, that impish face and smooth, shin- 
ing-black hair, those slender limbs that 
moved instinctively to rhythm—they will 
not charm any audience again. She is 
dead, a genius of thirty-two. 

“Somehow the news of her death in 
New York does not surprise one as 
perhaps it should. As one remembers 
her—and how she conquered London 
in ‘Blackbirds’—it 
is the note of 
tragedy that 
comes clearest, a 
touch of sadness 
which tinged ev- 
erything she did. 

“In her gayest 
song there was 
that haunting un- 
dertone. Always, 
everywhere, she 
was conscious of 
the tragic fate of 
the Negro race. 

* * * 

“My last mem- 
ory of her, before 
she left England, 
is of riding with 
her on one of her 
secret rides of 
charity around 
London. 

“It was mid- 
night. She leaned 
back in a corner of the great car, huddled 
in a coat so big that only her eyes 
showed, gleaming. Her Negro husband 
—cheerful, careless U. S$. Thompson— 
sat beside her. We drove along the 
Embankment. - 

“At every seat, with its pathetic ar- 
ray of human wreckage, we stopped. 
She pressed money into her husband’s 
hand. He stepped out, and gave it to 
those men and women without a word. 

“And so, silently, we drove on. 

a 


“She danced for her race. She sang 
and acted and lived for her race. 

“She wanted to spur on her people 
by example,” said Mr. Cochran, today. 
“She proved that she herself was a great 
genius, and she urged her race to rise. 

“I cannot ever forget the night a few 
of us gave a dinner to the ‘Blackbirds’ 
company. I had proposed her health, 
had spoken of her as a wonderful ac- 
tress. Then she rose to reply. 


January, 1928 


“Her little voice came to us with 
the pathetic note that seemed always 
hidden in it. It said nothing in answer 
to my praise. It said, ‘I belong to the 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People’—and it spoke 
of that only. 

“Tears came—we somehow couldn't 
help it—into our eyes. 

a a 


“T shall never forget the night her 
show opened in London. The audience 
had come prejudiced against coloured 
performers. I knew it and expected a 
row. Five or six burly fellows of mine 
were there ready to deal with it. 

“A noisy opening number —you re- 
member it?—and then came Florence 
Mills. She walked on, in the silence, 





New Postage Stamps of the Belgian Congo 


dressed in ragged clothes. In that tiny, 
plaintive voice of hers’ she sang “The 
Sleepy Hills of Tennessee’. 

“You could have heard a pin drop. 
The atmosphere changed in a flash. The 
hostility melted out of it. And the house 
came down in torrents and cheers. 

“She was among the first six artists 
in the world—a great actress and a 
great woman. Her death has hit me 
more than I can say.” 


THE CHALLENGE 


OBERT T. KERLIN writes in 
the World Outlook, Geneva, 


Switzerland: 


“The greatest challenge that ever 
confronted the statesmen of any coun- 
try’: I repeat a commonplace. But 
I have no sooner written the words 
than I think of India, Egypt, South 
Africa, China, the Philippines, and all 
the South and Central American repub- 


lics. Let its relative importance alone, 
then, and consider only some of its 
aspects. 


The present outlook as regards in- 
ter-racial relations in the United States 
holds forth the promise of better things 
and the threat of worse, depending on 
the region contemplated. In the South: 
vast improvement, attended by occasional 
set-backs—such as the revival of lynch- 
ing in 1926; in the North: increasing 
friction, uncertain race alienation. 

The enlightened American Negro is 
identifying his interests with the inter- 
ests of all the peoples of African descent 
in every land and clime. He is studying 
world politics, and his horizon encom- 
passes the five continents and seven seas. 
Of this fact the supreme Caucasian 

mind may well 

take thought. One 
further word of 
caution. It per- 
tains to the cine- 
ma. The day of 
caricaturing the 

Negro is passing 

in America: is 

Europe to be en- 

tertained by a 

racial slander that 

America has 

gained the wis- 

dom to repudiate ? 

One may as well 

trust the cinema 

for a true picture 
of the cowboy. 

Against the aver- 

age American 

tourist another 
- caution might be 
whispered. He 
and the cinema 

are about on a 
par with respect to conscience and cul- 
ture. One’s caricature is as grotesque 
as the other’s. 

The solution of the problem? Edu- 
cation. The education of the Whites. 


HEALTH 


HE Weekly Bulletin of the Chi- 
cago Department of Health has 
this article by the commissioner: 


In July, 1926, I made a public an- 
nouncement that I was anxious next 
to attack one of the great healih prob- 
lems facing the city of Chicago; namely, 
the high sickness and death rates among 
the Negroes of Chicago. 

The facts were laid before Aldermen 
Anderson, Jackson and Cronson and 
their cooperation was asked in securing 
funds to finance a fact-finding survey 
on the health conditions of the Negro 
in Chicago. At a meeting of the Finance 
Committee it was voted to provide funds

for the survey. This action of the 
Finance Committee was concurred in 
by the Council and the active work of 
the survey conducted by a Negro staff 
was begun May 2, 1927, and completed 
on July 29, 1927. This survey was con- 
ducted under the direction of Dr. H. 
L. Harris, Jr., and an Advisory Com- 
mittee made up of eminently able, fair- 
minded and representative persons un- 
der the chairmanship of Dr. I. S. Falk. 

The results of this three-months’ sur- 
vey have been studied and the report 
and recommendations have been pre- 
sented to me. 

It is my privilege to present to the 
public a few of the principal facts 
brought out in the report: 

The Negro death rate in Chicago is 
twice that of the city as a whole. These 
rates figured on the basis of 3,048,000 
total population and 160,000 Negro 
population, for 1926, are 11.68 per 1,000 
for the entire city and 22.8 per 1,000 
for the Negroes; the respective rates 
for infant mortality are 66.6 per 1,000 
live births reported for the entire city 
and 94.7 per 1,000 live births reported 
to Negro mothers. Had the city rate 
of 66.6 applied to the 4,341 Negro ba- 
bies born in 1926, 123 of the 409 who 
died during the first year of life would 
have been saved. 

.The largest losses of life among Ne- 
groes are from highly preventable dis- 
eases, viz.: tuberculosis, pneumonia and 
the diseases of infancy. 


The communities in which Negroes re- 
side in largest numbers are poor in 
health-serving agencies. Furthermore, 
not all institutions existing in these com- 
munities extend their services to Ne- 
groes. The Negro population of Chi- 
cago may be expected to increase. This 
change will probably be hastened by the 
economic upheaval due to the Missis- 
sippi flood, and the mechanization of 
agriculture. The Negro and Mexican 
at present furnish the largest sources 
of cheap labor in Chicago. When they 
first arrive in Chicago they usually live 
under conditions which constitute pro- 
nounced health hazards and which de- 
serve attention. 


HAMPTON 
LETTER comes from Phoebus, 


Virginia: 

I am herewith enclosing clippings 
from students expelled from Hampton 
Institute in consequence of the recent 
upheaval there. I am not sure that the 
statements of these students have in any 
other way come to your notice. I want 
to congratulate you upon your article 
in the Nation. 

I have been a neighbor of Hampton 
Institute for the past 28 years and I 
am thoroughly convinced that the out- 
side public is not fully acquainted with 
the policies of Hampton Institute espe- 
cially with regard to the relationship 
of the races there. I have felt for a 
long time that some disinterested edu- 
cator or publicist should learn the facts 
regarding the Hampton Institute and 
set them forth to the public. I hope 
that you will further investigate condi- 


22 


tions, and as you have done with regard 
to other schools, give the public the 
full benefit of your knowledge. 

A student is now charged with feloni- 
ous assault upon a white instructor who 
hails from North Carolina. From all 
I can learn he will hardly get justice 
in the courts here unless strong influ- 
ence is brought to bear. I wish you 
would call the attention of the N. A. 
A. C. P. to this case. I am of the 
opinion that this Association would feel 
justified in aiding this boy in making 
the proper defense. 


This is one of the clippings: 

During the recent trouble at Hamp- 
ton, a student came to the writer and 
said: “I agree with you fellows abso- 
lutely, but I am within a few months 
of my degree and I cannot afford to 
say anything or to take part.” Today 
that student is at Hampton observing 
the danger signal on the surface,, but 
inwardly Such people are the kind 
whom Hampton welcomes with jout- 
stretched hands. She may desire that 
kind of docility, but she has had more 
of it than she will ever have again. The 
young Negro of today realizes the fact 
that he cannot afford to sell his man- 
hood to any institution for a college 
degree. During the difficulty of Octo- 
ber 8 to 31, which some have called 
“The Glorious Revolution” many Hamp- 
ton degrees were given up with a smile. 
Who would not smile when he has the 
opportunity of making such an easy se- 
lection as choosing between manhood 
and a college degree. There can be a 
man without a college degree; but 
there can be no college degree without 
a man. : 





Another letter comes from North 
Carolina: 

Dear Sir: 

As a member of the Hampton strike 
committee I want to take this oppor- 
tunity of thanking you for so. clearly 
expressing the true statements and fun- 
damental reasons underlying the Hamp- 
ton strike situation. As far as I have 
been able to see, most publications have 
given some rather vague, and in some 
cases, rather distorted facts concerning 
the matter. The December issue of 
Tue Crisis, however, arrived at what 
I consider the very essence and roots 
of the affair. In this matter THE 
Crisis alone has merited its name as a 
true and unbiased—voice of the people. 
I feel sure that each member of the 
Hampton strike committee will feel just 
as strongly as I do the very great ser- 
vice that THe Crisis has done us in 
clearing this matter in the minds of the 
reading public. 

I have been following the members 
of the committee ever since we were 
dismissed from Hampton and, so far 
as I have been able to learn, practically 
all the schools have closed their doors 
to them. Following along the line of 
the December Crisis, I want to agree 
that this is indeed very unfortunate; 
but, I wish to say that all the schools 
have not been so narrow as to exclude 
the members that took part in Hamp- 
ton’s strike—4. & T. College has dealt 


quite liberally with the striking stu- 
dents. After two of us, members of 
that strike committee, were able to get 
statements from Hampton saying that 
Hampton would offer no objections to 
our entering, A. & T. College cheer- 
fully admitted us. I think that it should 
be known that at least one school has 
been able to find it in its heart to give 
the students, who fought for better con- 
ditions at Hampton, another chance. 

Further, as a member of the com- 
mittee, I feel that Hampton owes us 
more generous consideration than it has 
given us. In the first place, whereas 
the members of the committee were not 
the arch rebels and traitors, the despoil- 
ers and destroyers that .Hampton has 
seemed disposed to picture us in its 
mind; and since this said committee was 
elected by the students themselves; and 
since this committee was the only body 
on the Hampton campus that was able 
to maintain order and prevent the whole- 
sale chaos and destruction that. could 
have followed in the wake of the strike, 
Hampton has treated the committee 
which protected it when it- was unable 
to protect itself in a manner not to re- 
flect any of the goodwill of the commit- 
tee members upon it. 

I want to beg your pardon for hav- 
ing written so much and hope that this 
long letter has not seriously incon- 
venienced you in your work. Thank 
you both for the excellent articles in 
the December Crisis and for taking the 
time to read this letter. 


ART IN MUSIC 
HICAGO has had a week of 


Negro art which culminated 
with a concert in Orchestra Hall. 
Herman Devries in the Chicago 
American says: 


The Negro race was ably represented 
last. night by a concert at Orchestra 
Hall,. interpreted entirely by Negro ar- 
tists, who offered an ambitious program 
of standard music and of spirituals, 
these latter sung by the Fisk Jubilee 
Singers. The “star” of the early part 
of the concert was without doubt Mme. 
Lillian Evanti, coloratura soprano, 
whose recital appearance at the Eighth 
Street Theater some time ago was a 
distinct success. Mme. Evanti’s sing- 
ing yesterday seemed to me even bet- 
ter than at her local debut. Her colora- 
tura facility is uncommonly good, the 
trill steady and even, so that the 
“Lakme” bell song was carried through 
effectively. But with the Handel “Care 
Selve” she was well-nigh impeccable. 
The style had classic serenity, excellent 
technique and softly modulated tone. 

Miss Hazel Harrison, who was 
praised by this department when she 
played under the tutelage of Victor 
Heinze, was down for three chorales 
by Bach-Busoni and a Bach-Petri con- 
certo. Clarence Cameron White, whose 
book of spirituals came in for para- 
graphs of laudation in this column not 
long hence, played the “Vitali Ciaccona,” 
and I must admit that his talents as 
adapter and composer outrank his gifts 
as a violinist. (Turn to page 31)

EXCLUSION 


N Czarist Russia the number of Jews 
admitted to universities was strictly 
limited. In Hungary they are mob- 
bing and beating the Jews to keep 
them out of college. In the United 


January, 1928 


Rudolph and Julius Whitsell, Mt. Vernon, III. 


States at Harvard, Columbia and such 
institutions underground methods are 
used to limit the number of Jews and 
Negroes admitted. But Butler Col- 
lege, Indianapolis, goes back to the 
open and honest methods of Czarist 
Russia. Butler is “conceived by Chris- 
tian influences and dedicated to the 
dispensation of a religious education, 
fitting men for Christian living’. A 
few years ago it had practically no 
Negro students. ‘Then as the number 
of Negroes increased in the high 
schools of Indianapolis a considerable 
number of them went to Butler. Last 
year Butler graduated twelve Negro 
students. This seems to have alarmed 


the authorities and this year 
they have announced that 
only ten colored students 
will be received each year. 
One can understand racial 
reactions due to crime, pov- 
erty .and laziness, but the 
exclusion of ambitious, young 
students from institutions of 
learning, supported by pub- 
lic benevolence and “Chris- 
tianity”, merely on account 
of race and color, is a con- 
tradiction of every known 
principle of democracy and 
religion. 


TSANA 


ET those who would 

be wise watch Tsana. 

Tsana is a lake in North- 

east Africa; a little lake, less 

than fifty miles wide; but 

out of Tsana and the hills 

of Abyssinia wanders in a 

great curve the blue Nile; 

and away down at Khar- 

tum, the blue Nile joins the 

white Nile which has flowed 

already a thousand miles 

from the Great Lakes; and 

these two together march 

down through Egypt making 

the Nile of history. The 

white Nile and the Nile be- 

low Khartum, England has 

grabbed. But the blue Nile 

belongs to Abyssinia. Eng- 

land would like to dam it 

and use its waterpower, but 

the Abyssinians are blocking 

them as they have blocked them before. 

They are flirting with American manu- 

facturers and American capital to 

build that dam and England is sol- 

emnly warning America not to dare 
touch Tsana. Watch Tsana. 


SOUTH CAROLINA 


UR report of schools in South 
Carolina was published before 

we had the 58th Annual Report of 
the State Superintendent of Education 
covering the scholastic year 1925-26. 
The state received during that year 
$18,522,379 for education. Of this 
it paid out in salaries $8,461,909 to 


23 





NRE ee ee ae er ET ee ee eee

white teachers and $1,307,788 to col- 
ored teachers. The white schools re- 
ceived $366,942 worth of furniture 
and equipment, while the Negro 
schools received $21,874. White pu- 
pils were transported to and from 
school at a cost of $471,489, while 
Negroes got along with $795. The 
grounds, buildings with repairs and 
land for white schools cost $2,899,- 
412 and for Negro schools $266,566. 
The total expenditure for all school 
purposes was, for whites $14,673,719 
and for Negroes $1,655,652! The 
average attendance in white schools 
was 182,137 and Negro schools 163,- 
245. The white schools ran 171 days; 
the Negro schools 144 days. And the 
per capita expenditure, according to 
average attendance, was $80.55 for 
white pupils and $10.20 for colored 
pupils! 

If these figures, brazenly published 
in cold print by the state of South 
Carolina, do not form a basis for an 
appeal to the Supreme Court of the 
United States for justice, then there 
is no justice in the courts. 


W ARLEY 

HERE is a man down in Louis- 

ville, Kentucky, named William 
Warley. He is a young man and 
brave and he has fought hard and 
tenaciously for the rights and self-re- 
spect of the Negro race. It was War- 
ley that smashed the Segregation Or- 
dinance in Louisville; it was Warley 
that attacked lynching, whether by 
mobs or courts; and above all, it was 
Warley that tried to pound the fact 
into the heads of black voters that 
until they had courage and sense 
enough to vote for men and not for 
parties, for Democrats who helped 
them and against Republicans who 
flouted them, their right to vote would 
amount to nothing. 

Today William Warley is heart- 
broken. He is bowed down with dis- 
couragement because a mob of his own 
people, drunk and disorderly, smashed 
his printing office on election night. 

Why did they do this? Because the 
dirty Republican machine of Ken- 
tucky, which for a generation has 
treated Negroes like dogs, had won 
a victory in the election over the 
Democrats, who have treated Negroes 
just as badly but with more cause for 
they receive no Negro votes. 

But cheer up, Warley, and fight on. 
If every leader of muddle-headed hu- 
manity threw up the sponge because 
the fools whom they were trying to 
guide would not be guided, there would 
not be a single popular leader in the 
world today. z 

But you who read this are not fools. 
You are intelligent and thoughtful. 
You know Warley was right. You 
know that until American Negroes 


24 


learn to follow the advice of men like 
Warley they can never win. Very 
good. Now what are you doing to 
encourage men like Warley and fur- 
nish them a decent living while they 
fight on? What is your community 
doing to make young black men and 
women choose to fight the good fight 
of faith rather than be the most suc- 
cessful gambler in Louisville or New 
York? When your son and your 
friends’ sons look about for a career 
will they be encouraged by what they 
see and hear to- fight with men like 
Warley, to sacrifice and struggle, to 
be honest, frank, true and forthright ; 
or will they choose the easiest way: 
tc fawn and surrender, to get money 
and plenty of it by any method not 
too dangerous and then to turn and 
sneer at “race leaders”? 

If that is the public opinion of 
young Negroes in your home and in 
your group and in your city, you are 
responsible for it. You have lynched 
Warley’s spirit and your race is God 
damned. 


EAR SIR: 

A week or so ago I had the op- 
portunity of glancing through an issue 
of Tue Crisis for the first time. Ap- 
parently you are decidedly in favor 
of Negro equality with the white race 
in every respect. 

Considering you an authority in 
your field, I am making the following 
queries in hopes that you may find 
time to answer them. I should like 
to encorporate your statements in a 
term paper, if possible. 

First: do you consider the white and 
black races to be naturally on an equal 
footing intellectually and morally? 
(Disregarding the possibly artificial 
color discrimination prevalent in the 
South). 

Second: is the segregation of one 
race from another an incorrect and 
harmful custom? Do you advocate 
race amalgamation, or do you think 
the Negro has enough pride and con- 
fidence in his own race to wish to keep 
it distinct? 

Third: I have heard it said that un- 
less the white man keeps the upper 
hand on the Negro, the Negro will in- 
sist upon domineering as though a su- 
perior. They can not remain on an 
equal footing. In other words, one 
must always have the upper hand. Do 
you agree with this viewpoint? 

Fourth: do you advocate the return 
of Negroes to Africa for the purpose 
of permanent colonization? Why or 
why not? 

Fifth: should the Negro race as a 
whole “dig in” and work its way to 
the top as other races have done, or 
should it be accepted in all society be- 
cause of the eminence of a few Negro 


celebrities at the present time? 
Sixth: does race amalgamation bring 
out inferior tendencies in either or both 
uniting peoples? 
These perhaps sound meandering 


and not to the point, but they are . 


questions which are discussed warmiy 
and at length every week in our class 
rooms. 


Bernice E. Branp (San Diego, Cal.) 
My dear Madam: 


Answering your questions, I beg to 


say: 

(1) I consider the white and black 
races “potentially equal”. Of course, 
this leaves untouched the question as 
to what you mean by “white” and 
“black” races and what anybody would 
mean by “potentially equal”. 

(2) I consider attempted race 
segregation harmful because it is in- 
creasingly impossible under the’ pres- 
ent organization of the civilized world. 
I neither advocate nor oppose race 
amalgamation. I accept it as a fact 
as old as humanity. It is none of my 
business and none of yours if two peo- 
ple wish to get married who are sane, 
healthy and of full age. If we try 
to stop such marriages because they 
do not please us the result is more 
harmful than the marriage could pos- 
sibly be. Whatever pride or self-con- 
fidence the Negro race has or may 
have in America, he has found it im- 
possible to protect his women from 
the lust of your fathers, brothers, hus- 
bands and sons. The only way to 
make a race self-protecting, in its pride 
is not to degrade it, disfranchise it and 
insult it. 

(3) I do not believe that the only 
relations between men or groups of 
men are the relation of master and 
serf, ruler and ruled. 

(4) I do not advocate the return 
of Negroes to Africa nor the return 
of white people to Europe. I believe 
that the world belongs to its inhabit- 
ants and that if an Englishman wishes 
to migrate to America or a Negro to 
Africa both should have the right to 
do so under such general rules of phys- 
ical health and economic opportunity 
as could be laid down by fair and just 
men. 

(5) I believe that all men, white 
and black, should be accepted and 
rated according to their individual ac- 
complishment. 

(6) Race amalgamation “brings 
out” nothing. Everything depends 
upon the social environment of the 
offspring and the parents.

Impudence is a sin which cannot be 
forgiven in a Negro. Sheffield Col- 
lins, a young colored boy, was so im- 
pudent as to refuse to box to amuse 
the soldiers. He was also accused of 
stealing the oranges which were sent 
for free distribution among the refu- 
gees. The soldiers, by the way, helped 
themselves liberally to the oranges 
which were donated to the refugees, 
so that if anyone could be said to 
“steal” it was surely they rather than 
the refugee. Here is the statement 
Sheffield Collins is reported to have 
made: 


Witnesses: 


STATEMENT OF SHEFFIELD COLLINS, 
104 Lake Street, 
Greenville, Miss. 


I, the undersigned, a refugee from 
Greenville, Miss., on last Friday morning 
was told to box another Negro boy by 
one of the soldiers on duty at Fort Hill. 
I replied that I did not want to box 
because my Mother had told me not to. 
This soldier told me that he was going 
to make me box because I had stolen 
some oranges. I had two oranges in my 
pocket that I had gotten out of the 
basket where they had been thrown away. 
One of the soldiers then said, “Go and 
get a case of oranges and make him eat 
them all”, but Col. Tom Shaw pulled the 
gloves off of me and carried me down 
the hill, took my belt off and whipped 
me with it. 

I have had the above statement read 
to me and it is true and correct. 

SHEFFIELD COLLINS. 


STATEMENT OF Tom SHAW, Guardsman, 
Camp Fort Hill, 


May 14, 1927. 


I put the gloves on him and asked him 
if he was going to box and he told me 
“Hell, no”, and he was not going to box 
anybody. For two or three days he had 
been refusing to do anything I asked 
him to do. He was also very impudent 
about it, so I took him down under the 
hill and gave him a whipping, not be- 
cause he would not box but because he 
was so impudent and had been so for 
several days. And also because he had 
been stealing oranges and I took oranges 
out of his pockets several times. On this 
occasion he had two in his pocket, and 
oranges had already been issued to him 
before this time. His quota for the day 
was one orange, and he had eaten it. 
The two he had then was stolen. I hit 
him about five licks with his belt and he 
was not in any way injured. It is neces- 
sary to use some such means of punish- 
ment in order to keep order and discipline 
in the camp. 

Tom SHAw.

tributed for the disaster sufferers is

an interesting incident. Captain 
Moser, then the commanding officer 
at Camp Louisiana, ordered a truck- 
load of these oranges (which were be- 
ing distributed free) to be dumped 
into a ravine and buried. Capt. Moser 
said they were unfit for consumptioi. 
This was denied at the time by a num- 
ber of enlisted men. Capt. Moser 
was at the time running the canteen 
at Camp Louisiana, in the success of 
which he had a personal interest. He 
sold oranges in this canteen and the 
enlisted men gossipped about this co- 
incidence. 


NDER an officer of this type it 
cannot be wondered at that abuses 
ot all kinds flourished. Drunkenness on 
duty was common. Bootleg whiskey 
was easily obtainable by the simple ex- 
pedient of trading for it quantities of 
Red Cross supplies from the kitchens. 
Guardsmen were accused of having 
insulted and attempted assault upon 
colored women. Upon “investigation” 
these accusations were reported as hav- 
ing no foundation in fact. The stories 
continued to be whispered and detailed 
accounts given. Protests were made 
by private citizens who had their facts 
from the conversation of the guards- 
men themselves. Nothing was estab- 
lished and no action was taken. 
Officers such as Capt. Moser seem 
to have been the rule. An exception 
was Lieut. May who was placed in 
charge at Camp Hayes early in June. 
The change in camp life after he took 
charge was so instant and complete 
that everyone who saw it remarked 
upon it for weeks afterward. Camp 
was “cleaned up” in every way. Rea- 
sonable rules were enforced. Arbit- 
rary and unnecessary rules were 
changed or abolished. From a noisy, 
unsanitary confusion camp Hayes be- 
came a clean, quiet and pleasant place. 
Had such an officer as Lieut. May 
been in charge of the colored camps 
it is possible that even there the worst 
abuses would have been discontinued.

N. A. A. C. P. Battle Front 


(From page 13) country, charging of- 
ficers of the Gary branch of the N. A. 
A. C. P. with membership in a “black 
Ku Klux Klan”. These charges met 
with the prompt denial of the officers 
in question and the public contempt 
which they deserved. They could not 
and did not hinder the united and re- 
sistless struggle of colored people un- 
der N. A. A. C. P. leadership in Gary 
in behalf of their fundamental rights. 
At present writing, there is every rea- 
son to believe the attempt at segrega- 
tion of Gary high school students, to 
be decisively defeated, and at a cost 
of less than $300 to date expended by 
the Gary branch. This speaks vol- 
umes, not only for the colored attor- 
neys who carried out a victorious fight 
on so small a sum, but also for the 
sentiment which stood behind them 
and backed them up in a Klan-preju- 
diced community.

J anuary, 1928 


Perhaps one of the most superficial 
and reactionary articles we have found 
in months appears in the December is- 
sue of the Forum, under the title 
“Black Ballots in the White South”, 
by George F. Milton. Mr. Milton 
tries to prove that at bottom the popu- 
lar opinion that the Negro is deprived 
of his citizenship rights in the South 
is untrue! 

Quite as bad is the article by Fred- 
erick Palmer appearing in Liberty for 
November 19, declaring that “White 
Magic in Black Haiti” has been the 
salvation of that tropical land! 

After the reams written by white 
people on us pro and con, “our black 
folks” will be interested in “Our 
White Folks”, an article by George S. 
Schuyler in the American Mercury for 
December. Mr. Schuyler has done a 
good piece of work in this, pointing out 
the weaknesses, the pathos and the hu- 
mor of our position in the United 
States. 

If you have never breathed the nec- 
tared fragrance of the Haitian jungle, 
if the velvet blackness of a tropic night 
has never hung heavy about you, let 
Mark Barr describe these things to 
you in his article on “Roughing it in 
the Tropics” in the October issue of 
Atlantic Monthly. He takes you deep 
under the blue sea where warm-hued 
coral and gorgeously tinted sponges 
nestle close to the magic sea floor; 
and he makes you feel the pulse of the 
open Haitian country. 

Harlem glows in “Fire by Night” 
in the December issue of McClure’s. 
Rudolph Fisher again proves himself a 
tip-top story teller in this tale of 
gambling, religion and fighting. We 
won’t say that this is the best work 
Mr. Fisher has done, but he displays 
that invaluable faculty of keeping his 
material well in hand—of knowing at 
all times what it is he wants to say 
and just how he wants to say it. 

Marve JACKSON 


The Far Horizon 
(From page 22) 

Major enjoyment came with the Fisk 
singers, who “do” spirituals so convinc- 
ingly that I doubt whether any one will 
ever be able to make us believe they 
can be sung more fascinatingly. These 
five men with their lone lady associate 
stir the imagination. I do not think I 
need to add that these days one finds 
no necessity for offering explanation of 
the presence of the Negro in public life. 
His works speaks for him.

This Golden Rule has been called the 
best of all moral maxims and should 
be applied to individual, family, state 
and nation and if applied internationally 


“the golden age of the earth will be 
realized”. 


ae 


1. Is it observing the Golden Rule 
for our great Republic to deal like a 
tyrant with the little Negro Republic 
of Haiti? ; 

2. Is the Golden Rule considered in 
drawing a color line in Labor Unions? 

3. Is it doing as you would be done 
by when the race line is drawn as to 
the learning of skilled trades? 

4. Is there anything of the letter or 
spirit of the Golden Rule in excluding 
people from clubs or theatres on the 
color line? 

5. Are not “Jim Crow” cars an 
ignoring of the Golden Rule? 

6. Is not the use of the titles, Nigger, 
Dago, Chink, Sheeny, Hunky, etc., a 
gross violation of the Golden Rule? 

7. Is not the whole system of depriv- 
ing men and women of social and po- 
litical rights because of race or color a 
banishing of the Golden Rule from hu- 
man life? 

8. Do net our American boys and 
girls, when they try to force out of our 
public schools boys and girls of other 
races, violate the Golden Rule?

ISS L. H. BYRD wants to 

study Home Economics. So 
she wrote to Temple University, the 
great Christian institution of Phila- 
delphia. She received this reply: 

“T regret to inform you that condi- 
tions at Temple University are not satis- 
factory for the admission of colored 
students to the course of Home Eco- 
nomics. 

“We require practice teaching for 
our diploma and it is also required for 
a State Teachers Certificate but we have 
no opportunity to obtain facilities for 
colored students to do supervised prac- 
tice teaching. In addition, a month of 
residence is required in a practice house, 
which is at the same time used as a 
dormitory for white girls. 

“T hope that I have stated the facts 
plainly and that you will understand 
that it is not through racial prejudice 
but solely because of circumstances be- 
yond our control that you cannot be ad- 
mitted to the Home Economics, Ele- 
mentary Education, Kindergarten Edu- 
cation or Junior High School courses. 

“Your application will be accepted 
for courses in High School Academic 
Subjects or the course in Health Edu- 
cation but if you plan to become a 
teacher of domestic science, I should ad- 
vise you to enter the Cheney Normal 
School at Cheney, Pa.” 

Very truly yours, 
E. H. Homan, Registrar. 


JIM CROW 


HIS is the way S. W. Green, 

Supreme Chancellor of the Col- 
ored Pythians talks to the editor of 
the Houston Informer: 

You refer, Mr. Editor to the colored 
Pythians of America being too “coward- 
ly and spineless to-hold one Biennial 
meeting in Texas in 45 years”. The 
colored Pythians of America are not 
too “cowardly nor spineless to hold one 


Biennial meeting in Texas in 45 years”, 
They have too much courage and too 
much respect for their women folk, 
and too much of a desire to promote 
the welfare and prosperity of the 
Knights of Pythias of North America, 
South America, Europe, Asia, Africa 
and Australia to jeopardize the welfare 
of the members of their Uniform Rank 
Department, and to shield their women 
folk from the humiliations and insults 
of the “Jim Crow” street cars. The 
colored Pythians of America have not 
met in Alabama in 45 years. They 
have not met in Georgia in 45 years, 
and yet Georgia has the largest mem- 
bership, and pays the largest amount of 
taxes to the Supreme Lodge than any 
Grand Jurisdiction. The Colored Pyth- 
ians of America have not met in Ten- 
nessee in 45 years. They have not met 
in South Carolina nor North Carolina 
in 45 years. If any of our Grand Juris- 
dictions should have reasons to complain 
of the failure of the Supreme Lodge to 
hold one of its Biennial meetings in their 
Grand Jurisdiction, it should be the 
Grand Lodge of Mississippt in which 
the Supreme Lodge has not held one of 
its Sessions since it was born in that 
State in the year 1880. It has there- 
fore been 47 years since the Supreme 
Lodge of the Knights of Pythias of 
North America, Etc., met at its birth- 
plae—THE GRAND LODGE OF 
MISSISSIPPI—and yet, Mr. Editor, 
the representatives from the Grand 
Lodge of Mississippi would not invite 
the Supreme Lodge of the Knights of 
Pythias of North America, Etc., to vote 
to accept the humiliating conditions of 
“Jim Crow” raiiroad cars and “Jim 
Crow” street cars to come to Missis- 
sippi to hold one of its Biennial Ses- 
sions. 


REVOLUTION 
T the annual meeting ot the 
Methodist Episcopal Board of 
Foreign Missions, the N. Y. Times 
reports that: 

“Stanley High, author and journalist 
and a Secretary of the board, who has 
just returned from Africa and Asia, 
in an address warned of an impending 
inter-racial conflict between the white 
and non-white populations of the Afri- 
can continent. The growth of nation- 
alism in Africa, he said, was more mo- 
mentous than in China, India or the 
Philippines, but it was being overlooked 
by the white races. 

“The white man’s booze, his gam- 
bling dens, comprise one set of forces 
that are making the new Africa,” he 
said. “The propagandists of the So- 
viets, using mob tactics and preaching 
hate and revolution, constitute a fur- 
ther influence.” 


ROFESSOR CLARKE writes 
in the London Daily News: 
Nothing is more significant of the new 
order of life that is developing in South 
Africa as the country passes more com- 
pletely into the modern world system 
than the strong movement among na- 
tive workers towards trade union or- 
ganization.

Picken’s “American Aesop” 


‘ January, 1928 





The Industrial and Commercial 
Workers’ Union (I. C. U.), consisting 


almost entirely of natives, is not yet ten’ 


years old. Yet it claims a membership 
of anything up to 50,000 or more; it 
has sent its general secretary, Clements 
Kadalie, first as an unofficial delegate 
to Geneva and then to pursue a lecture- 
tour through Europe and America; it 
has secured afhliation to the Interna- 
tional Federation of Trade Unions as 
representative of South African labour; 
and it has set going by way of reaction 
to its own growth a distinct movement 
among white trade unions towards sym- 
pathetic action. 

It is now a force to: be reckoned with, 
and its aims and organization, its meth- 
ods and achievements, afford striking 
and significant evidence of the strange 
new forces that are at work in a land 
which finds itself more than a little be- 
wildered in consequence. 


HE great Mahatma Ghandhi in 

his “Story of My Experiment 
with Truth” (Current Thought for 
July, 1927) says: 

And just as I freed myself from the 
slavery to the washerman, even so | 
threw off the dependence on the barber. 
All people going to England learn there 
at least the art of shaving, but none 
to my knowledge cut his own hair. I 
had to learn that too. I once went to 
an English hair-cutter in Pretoria. He 
contemptuously refused to cut my hair. 
I certainly felt hurt, but immediately 
purchased a pair of clippers and cut my 
hair before the mirror. I succeeded 
more or less in cutting the front hair, 
but I spoiled the back. The i-'ends 
in the court shook with laughter. 

“What's wrong with your 
Gandhi? Have rats been at it?” 

“No. The white barber would not 
condescend to touch my black hair. So 
I preferred to cut it myself.” 

The reply did not surprise the friends. 
There was every chance of the barber’s 
losing his custom if he cut black men’s 
hair. We do not allow our barbers to 
serve our untouchable brethren. I got 
the reward of it in South Africa, not 
once, but many a time, and the convic- 
tion that it is the punishment for our 
own sins has saved me from being 
angry.

Postscript 

(From page 24) of the Negro race 
it was because Lincoln refused to al- 
low black men upon its Board of Trus- 
tees or black professors in its class- 
rooms. This year an epoch-making 
change has taken place. Dr. E. P. 
Roberts, a graduate of Lincoln, has 
become the first colored trustee, and 
the reason is that Dr. J. B. Laird, 
the Negro-hating Chairman of the 
Board has been removed and Dr. John 
N. Tinny, President of Johns Hop- 
kins University, has been made Chair- 
man. But this alone would not have 
sufficed had it not been for the persist- 
ent fight of the Lincoln Alumni, led 
by a committee of which Dr. W. G. 
Alexander was Chairman. Three 
men selected for the presidency re- 
fused the nomination because of the 
organized and open opposition of the 
Alumni; and when President John- 
son finally accepted it was known that 
the Alumni favored him because he 
was willing to have Negro trustees 
and Negro professors. It is with great 
joy that we transfer Lincoln from 
liability to asset. 


HAMPTON 
My dear Dr. Du Bois: 

I have your letter of the tenth offer- 
ing to print in the January number of 
Tue Crisis a reply from me to what 
you have written for The Nation and 
for THE CRIsIs in criticism of Hamp- 
ton Institute. 

I have no desiré to engage in a pub- 
lic controversy on this subject, and 
what I might say is sufficiently ex- 
pressed in an editorial which will ap- 
pear in the December number of The 
Southern Workman. 

But I should some day be glad of 
an opportunity to talk with you per- 
sonally about Hampton Institute as it 
is and as it hopes to be. For it seems 
clear to me that your present ideas oni 
this subject are not in accordance with 
the verifiable facts. 

James FE. Greco.
