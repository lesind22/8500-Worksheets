HE German people are being 

pushed resolutely toward the 
Right, that is, toward Reaction and 
Monarchy. But Socialistic Labor is 
still strong and will not continue to 
yield. There is a clash due. French 
Liberalism and Radicalism are being 
held back by the technical question of 
the value of the franc. Behind the 
money of nations stands today organ- 
ized Credit and Banking power; and 
this can compel, under certain circum- 
stances, Reform and Uplift to vield to 
Interest and Profit. This in France 
today is called “pegging the franc”. 
Reactionary Fascism once started in 
Italy is reeling into desperate reaction 
in sheer self-defense. It promises 
wider imperialism abroad, but it seri- 
ously curtails liberty at home: no 
criticism ; restrictions on education; re- 
strictions on literature and art. Im- 
perial England, under the autocracy of 
the Great and Wealthy, surges con- 
tinually toward War. Only Force 
and Force to the uttermost can save the 
present conception of the British Em- 
pire. Liberal and Labor England fight 
desperately but futilely against the

that they can wield is impotent before 
the autecracy that holds in its hand

China can only be explained in terms

Japan is not going to allow Western

careful to curb in themselves the wide-

Your Cab Company 


By CAMILLE COHEN-JONES 


UT in Oberlin, Ohio, in the 
QO seventies, Henry Lee, a colored 

man, owned and operated for 
thirty-five years a livery stable with 
seventy-five horses and two acres of 
stables. Also he and Martha Moals, 
whom he married, had thirteen chil- 
dren—six boys and seven girls. One 
of the boys, Walter, was born Janu- 
ary 25, 1871, at Oberlin. From the age 
ot seven years he assisted his father in 
his business, coming home from school 
and getting right into the heart of the 
business. 


At the age of sixteen, Walter left 
school and took full charge of his 
father’s business. Finally, when his 
father decided to sell out and give each 
child his share, Walter Howard refused 
to be given anything. There were too 
many brothers and sisters and Walter 
had plans of his own. He had deter- 
mined to conquer Chicago. 

First of all, at the age of twenty-five, 
Walter married Ella Nora Massey. 
Then he came to Chicago. After look- 
ing the field over he decided on the 
coal business. He opened up a whole- 
sale and retail coal business and began

to do well. But white men did not 
want this colored competitor and began 
making it hard for him to buy coal. He 
found he could no longer order the coal 
in the car loads as he needed it to meet 
competition. There was still some 
money to be made in coal and hundreds 
of colored men had followed him in 


Walter Howard Lee 


that business when he had paved the 
way for them. But Walter Howard 
Lee wanted to do bigger business and 
since the way to grow here was closed, 
he left the coal business and became 
the pioneer colored ice man. He 
opened a wholesale and retail ice busi- 
ness which he managed profitably for 
some time until again white competi- 
tors cut off his supply in the wholesale 
market. Here again he left behind him 
a trail of colored ice men who had 
followed in his footsteps and were do- 
ing small but successful business; but 
Walter Howard Lee wanted bigger 


business and left the ice business %o 
the men who were satisfied to carry 
on meagre profits. 

That brings us then to the year of 
1921 when Frank Gillespie, the 
Founder-President of the Liberty Life 
Insurance Company, had his dream and 
vision. He had no more enthusiastic 
listener than Walter Howard Lee. 
When the foundation for the company 
was laid, Lee went out as an agent and 
sold $45,000 of the $100,000 stock 
necessary to begin operating. He 
worked up from-an agent to the 


position of treasurer, which he still 
holds in the Liberty Life Insurance 
Company. 


EE now began some hard thinking 
because he was not a mere business 
man: he was a Dreamer in Business, 


a Prophet of Profits. He wanted to 
find and open gates instead of sitting 
down before shut doors. Said Lee to 
himself: “Now, I have helped to form 
this big Insurance Company—but it 
takes employment to keep it up; in 
order for colored people to be in a posi- 
tion to pay their insurance premiums,

they must have work. I have bought 
stock in the Binga State and the 
Douglas National Banks but people can 
not save money unless they have some 
way of making it. It is up to me to 
find some more means for colored peo- 
ple in Chicago to earn money.” After 
thinking along these lines Walter Lee, 
as a liveryman’s son, thought he saw 
possibilities in the transportation prob-

watched the Yellow Cab and its prog- 
ress and he wondered why it was that 
he saw such a great number of Yellow 
Cabs with white drivers and white 
owners placed on the South Side where 


the colored people did the riding. 
Then too, the Yellow Cab Company 
served black Chicago when it got 
ready. It was often too busy. 

After much deliberation, Lee de- 
cided he would go to the Yellow Cab 
owners who had a monopoly of making 
cabs and have a talk with them about 
starting a colored cab company. He 
was discouraged from the beginning. 
They told him that the colored boys 
could not drive the cabs—unreliable, 
poor mechanics, etc. In every way 
they tried to discourage him. Finally, 
seeing that he still persisted in his plan, 
they decided to give him a chance. 
Consequently, he formed a stock com- 
pany with a few friends the latter part 
of July, 1923, and placed on the South 
Side ten maroon colored cabs labeled 
“Your Cab Company”; they were well 
equipped taxis, with colored chauf- 
feurs in uniform, who were courteous 
in every way. From that day to this 
the Your Cab Company and Walter 
Howard Lee have been the marvels of 
Chicago. When you say “Your Cab” 
you think of Walter Howard Lee; and 


6 


when you say Walter Lee you think of 
“Your Cab”. 

Mr. Lee went deeply into debt in 
order to prove that a colored cab com- 
pany could succeed. He did not make 
a stock campaign—those who believed 
in him came to him of their own ac- 
cord; but from the day he placed those 
ten cabs on the streets of the South 
Side of Chicago, the business began to 
pick up. First, the stock was sold for 
ten dollars a share, par value, paying 
a dividend of seven per cent on the 
preferred and paying that dividend 
right off the reel after operating the 
first year and every year since. 


FTER having kept his word as to 

dividends he started to pay off his 
indebtedness to the companies with 
which he dealt. This he did from the 
daily earnings of the cabs. When he 
placed the first ten cabs, he employed 
twenty-five persons and they were the 
real people behind the guns when the 
success of the Your Cab Company is 
mentioned. Salaries were paid prompt- 
ly, all claims paid promptly and all 
notes met promptly. 

It is only natural that a company 
with a man at the head of it with the 
bull-dog-tenacity-for-the-success-of-the- 
business should succeed. Today the 
Your Cab Company has a paid capital 
of $200,000; runs eighty cabs and em- 
ploys over 250 persons. It has recent- 
ly gone into its own new Garage and 
Office Building at 415-21 East Persh- 
ing Road and has a weekly pay roll of 
over $3,500. 

Walter Howard Lee still has a 
vision of more good things. He sees 
the opening of a Your Cab Cafeteria— 
so the employees will not have to go out 


to buy their lunches; they will buy 
right there in the building. A sales 
force is being organized to sell “Your 
Cab” stock. Another of his visions is 
the opening of a Your Cab Tailor 
Shop: he has to pay to have the uni- 
forms of the chauffeurs made and that 
could just as well be done about the 
place thus giving employment to per- 
haps fifty or one hundred more boys 
and girls; there is pressing and repair- 
ing to be considered and the chauf- 
feurs’ shoes to be looked after; why not 
right here, under one roof? Best of 
all, why not here under one roof and 
all by colored boys and girls, men and 
women? See the wonderful possibili- 
ties of the visions of Walter Howard 
Lee? 

Let us go further with him right 
now: he has visions of an automobile 
insurance company—it costs the Your 
Cab Company in the neighborhood of 
$20,000 per year to keep passengers 
safe. Why could it not have a com- 
pany of its own, the premiums going 
back to it, along with the other cars 
insured, thus giving employment to 
more? Then, last but not least, he has 
in mind, after having completed all 
other things, to form an investment 
company—a company owned and 
operated by the Your Cab Company 
for the purpose of helping the little 
fellows get into this business in other 
cities—the little fellows who have 
visions and no money. And when he 
has finally completed this and given 
employment and assistance to thousands 
in Chicago, then it is possible that the 
Chicago colored people will let him go 
and organize along the same lines for 
other cities; they do not mean to be 


selfish.

Foot Ball in Negro Colleges in 1926 


By PAUL W. L. JONES 





Williams 


HE greatest year in the history 
of Negro college foot ball was 
1926. Almost every Negro 
college was represented by a foot ball 
team. Every Saturday splendid 
crowds gathered to watch the gridiron 
battles. To the larger and more im- 
portant games fans flocked from every 
section of the country. Ten thousand 
saw the Tuskegee-Lincoln game at 
Philadelphia on October 30; about the 
same number witnessed the Howard- 
Lincoln Turkey Day batt!e; five thou- 
sand were present at the Wiley-Lang- 
ston tilt at Dallas, Texas; seven thou- 
sand saw the contest between Wilber- 
force and West Virginia at Columbus, 
Ohio, Thanksgiving Day; six thousand 
attended the Atlanta and Howard 
game at Atlanta; seven thousand saw 
Wiley down Bishop at Marshall, 
Texas, and eight thousand looked on 
when Tuskegee and Atlanta clashed 
at Atlanta, December 4. Everywhere 
foot ball became more popular. 

To Howard University goes the 
championship of Negro college foot 
ball in 1926. Howard’s victories, with 
two exceptions, were won by big mar- 
gins. Tuskegee looms up for claims 
to national championship, but How- 
ard’s victories were more impressive 
and give the easterners a clearer title 
to supremacy. Tuskegee beat Lincoln 
20 to 16; Howard downed Lincoln 
32 to 0. Tuskegee defeated Fisk 47 
to 13; Howard smothered Fisk 56 to 
0. Tuskegee won from Morehouse 
28 to 6; Howard swamped Morehouse 
52 to 0. Atlanta lost to Tuskegee 14 
te 0 and to Howard 7 to 0. Atlanta 
was the only team that played both 
Howard and Tuskegee from which

Tuskegee won by a larger score than 
did Howard. 

Howard had great wealth of ma- 
terial. Linemen and backs were nu- 
merous and every man was a star. The 
Howard machine was well oiled with 
confidence and the fighting spirit and 
its players would not be denied victory 
in any contest. ‘The smashing drives 
of the team overcame the most formid- 
able opposition. The Howardites 
were adepts at all angles of the game 
and played brilliantly in every con- 
flict.

Stevenson Smith 


Tuskegee defeated all opponents. In 
only three contests did Tuskegee have 
cause to worry. It beat Talladega by 
only one point, 28 to 27. Talladega 
played the greatest game of defensive 
foot ball that was seen anywhere dur- 
ing the season. Tuskegee met stiff op- 
position in Alabama State, but was 
able to win 14 to 7. In the Lincoln 
game with the score 16 to 11, Steven- 
son, Tuskegee’s great full back, on 
the third down, raced 80 yards for a 
touchdown and a few minutes later 
made a placement kick, making the 
score 20 to 16. Tuskegee taught the 
East a lesson. Eastern fans made the 
discovery that southern teams played 
foot ball and that foot ball bore the 
same trademark in all parts of the 
country. Let us hope that Tuskegee 
places on its 1927 schedule both east- 
ern and middle west teams. 

In Stevenson, Joyner, Bailey, Woo- 
ten and P. Smith, Tuskegee had five 
backs that were brainy, flashy and hard 
to stop. Tuskegee won the South- 
eastern Conference crown and has a 
clear title to the southern champion- 
ship. 

Wilberforce had the best team in the 
middle west. It lost two games, one 
of which it should have won easily. 
The Wilberforce backfield was one of 
the strongest of the year and its line 
had a hitting power that swept down 
opposition on almost every charge. 


INCOLN had the poorest team 
in its history. It lost to Wilber- 
force 7-0 and to Tuskegee and was 
crushed by Howard. West Virginia 
should have beaten the Lincolnites. 
Lincoln was on the defensive most of 


7 








the game and was outplayed in every 
period. An error of judgment on the 
part of Turner, West Virginia’s quar- 
ter back, in bucking the line on four 
downs with the ball on Lincoln’s one 
yard mark, saved the day for Lincoln 
and made the game a 7-7 tie. Had 
Turner attempted a short forward 
pass, an end run, or a run off tackle, 
Lincoln would have been caught off 
guard and would have gone down to 
defeat. 

West Virginia did not play as bril- 
liantly as in 1925. Its team was light 
in weight and it did not possess as full 
measure of the West Virginia fight 
and determination as the team of last 
year. Samuel Huston carried off 
honors in the southwest, winning from 
all opponents. Langston did not lose 
a game. Atlanta had a fighting team 
which would have played better foot 
ball had the players been thoroughly 
acquainted with each other and had 
the new men on the team been able 
to imbibe more fully the Atlanta spirit 
and to learn with greater rapidity the 
Atlanta system of play. It took Wiley 
a long time to.reach the apex of form. 
When the Wiley men did get down to 
real’ work, they made a wonderful 
showing, finishing third in the South- 
western Conference. Prairie View, 
with a splendid team, finished just 
ahead of Wiley, winning three, losing 
one and tying one. 

Hampton won the Colored Inter- 
collegiate Athletic Association cham- 
pionship. It won seven games and 
tied Virginia Seminary and College by 
the field goal route 3-3. Virginia 
Union won six games and lost one, 
Hampton winning from it 12 to 0. 
North Carolina A. & T. lost two 
games, losing to Hampton 14-6 and 
Virginia Union 7-6. St. Paul won 
three, lost five and tied one. Blue- 
field won three and lost two. Claflin 
won five, lost three and tied one. 
Clark won four, lost three and tied 
one. Knoxville won five and lost 
three. Morris Brown won three, tied 
one and lost two. Alabama State won 
six and lost three. Lincoln (Mo.) 
won four and lost one. Livingstone 
won two and lost five. Kentucky won 
three and lost three. 

The year saw upset upon upset. 
Every team had off days during the 
season. Wilberforce defeated West 
Virginia 3 to 2. Friends of both in- 
stitutions predicted a tie game. The 
game was a hard fought battle, with 
Wilberforce outplaying the West Vir- 
ginians in every quarter but one. 
Ritchie’s toe was on edge Thanksgiving 
Day, his first attempt at a field goal 
scoring the winning points and his sec- 
ond attempt failing to score by about 
two inches. Wilberforce was off in 
its game with Lincoln (Mo.). Un- 


8 





derestimating the strength of Lincoln, 
Wilberforce was beaten 8 to 0 in its 
first game. The Missourians had 
looked forward to the Wilberforce 
game with doubts and fears, but they 
were determined to give good account 
of themselves and from the start of the 
game played winning foot ball, fighting 
desperately to hold any advantage 
which they chanced to gain and fight- 
ing brought them victory. 


ANGSTON gave Lincoln ( Mo.) 

a sound beating. © Lincoln’s vic- 
tory over Wilberforce caused it to be 
picked to win, but Langston won eas- 
ily, outplaying Lincoln in every quar- 
ter, the final score being 43 to 0. 

Atlanta beat Morehouse 32 to 0 and 
Wiley downed Paul Quinn 30 to 0. 
Kentucky, after beating Simmons 13 
to 12, was badly licked by Knoxville 
33 to 0. Fans predicted a Knoxville 
win, but thought Kentucky would 
make a better showing, having touch- 
downed on both West Virginia and 
Wilberforce. Virginia Union defeated 
North Carolina A. & T. and Talla- 
dega beat Atlanta 19 to 0. Knoxville 
beat Talladega 21 to 6 and Atlanta 
trounced Knoxville 6 to 0. Clark was 
defeated by Morris Brown 6-3 and 
Claflin beat Morris Brown 12 to 3. 
Florida conquered Morris Brown 12 
to 3, only to lose later to Clark 13 
to 3. 

West Virginia was off form when 
Lincoln was played. Atlanta lost to 
Alabama State because the Atlantans 
did not regard Alabama a formidable 
foe. North Carolina State did not 
play its best in several engagements. 
Straight lost to New Orleans 12 to 9 
because Straight players were not in 
that frame of mind which brings men 
to fight their hardest. Howard’s war- 





riors did not play the brand of foot 
ball that conquers against Atlanta. 
True Atlanta fought and fought stub- 
bornly, but had Howard played more 
watchfully and with less confidence, 
its victory might have been won by a 
bigger score. Atlanta outfought and 
outplayed Howard at the start of the 
game. The “breaks” favored How- 
ard. 

Hampton defeated Virginia Union 
when everybody expected a tie or a 
Union victory. Clark defeated More- 
house 7 to 6 and Morehouse downed 
Fisk by the same score. Fisk was 
looked upon to win, and fans were 
surprised when Morehouse emerged 


triumphant from the conflict. Mor- 
ris Brown tied Atlanta, 0-0, and 
Southern tied Straight, 0-0. “Jap” 


Turner’s toe gave Prairie View vic- 
tory over Wiley, 3-0, and Clark beat 
Atlanta, the score being 9 to 0. 

Field goals decided several contests 
and the forward pass was a factor in 
many victories. Bluefield passed its 
way to a 35 to 12 victory over Vir-

Southern States was brought to 
.a sharp focus befere public 
opinion in the so-called Texas “White 
Primary” case argued before the United 
States Supreme Court early in January 
by attorneys for the N.A.A.C.P. For 
the Texas law, thus challenged befcre 
the highest tribunal in the land, con- 
stitutes one of the most flagrant at- 
tempts to deprive the Negro of his vote 
ever known in the United States. 

It is of course only part of the sys- 
tem in force throughout the South, in- 
stituted during Reconstruction and, in 
fact, is a hold-over of the slavery re- 
gime. Even the construction by the 
Supreme Court at various times of the 
15th Amendment to the United States 
Constitution has contributed to the dis- 
franchisement of colored voters. For, 
by the Supreme Court’s interpretation, 
a Negro might be beaten, intimidated, 
obstructed by violence in the attempt 
to vote. Yet, unless he could prove 
that the violence was practised on ac- 
count of race or color, the Negro had 
no redress. ‘To quote from Dr. Kirk 
H. Porter’s “Suffrage in the United 
States”: “In a word, the courts asked 
the Negro to prove what everybody 
knew to be a fact—that he was being 
kept from the polls on account of his 
race and color. And the unfortunate 
black found it quite impossible to prove 
that white ruffians waylaid and beat him 
because he was a Negro and intended 
to vote. It is hard to get away from 
the fact that the court decisions vio- 
late the spirit of the war amendments.” 

The disfranchisement practised un- 
der cover and color of legality elsewhere 
in the South was made a matter of 
open enactment on the books of law in 
the case of Texas. The legislature of 
this state in 1923 passed an act ex- 
plicitly barring all persons of color from 
voting in the primaries of the Demo- 
cratic party. The act reads as fol- 
lows: 

“All qualified voters under the laws 
and constitution of the State of Texas, 
who (sic) is a bona fide member of the 
Democratic Party, shall be eligible to 
participate in any Democratic primary 
election, provided such voter complies 
w'th all laws and rules governing party 
primary elections; however in no event 
shall a Negro be eligible to participate 
in a Democratic party primary election 
held in the State of Texas and should a 
Negro vote in a Democratic primary 
election, such ballot shall be void and 
election officials are herein directed to 
throw out such ballot and not count the 
same.” 

Such a law in a northern or western 
state, where parties are more or less

on Disfranchisement 
a ie tite 


evenly divided, would operate only to 
the disadvantage of the party in whose 
behalf such a law was passed. But in 
the South, particularly in Texas, where 
the Republican party possesses virtually 
no numerical strength whatever and 
where the candidates designated in the 
Democratic primaries are by that fact 
virtually elected to office, such a law as 
effectively deprives the Negro of a 
voice in elections as if he had been 
forbidden to vote altogether. 


HE case testing and challenging 

this law originated in El Paso. In 
that city Dr. L. A. Nixon, colored doc- 
tor of repute and good standing as a cit- 
izen, was a regularly enrolled member 
of the Democratic party and had paid 
his poll tax. He attempted on July*26, 
1924, to vote at 4 general primary elec- 
tion at which there were to be selected 
candidates for precinct, county, district 
and state offices and also for representa- 
tive in Congress and the United States 
Senate on the Democratic ticket. When 
Dr. Dixon applied at Precinct Number 
Nine in El] Paso, the judge and asso- 
ciate judge of elections there declined 
to permit him to cast a ballot, on the 
ground of the Texas law mentioned 
above. In order to enable a test case 
of the law to be made, the election offi- 
cials furnished Dr. Nixon with the fol- 
lowing certificate: 

“This is to certify that we, C. C. 
Herndon and Chas. Porras, Presiding 
and Associate Judges, respectively, have 
not permitted L. A. Nixon to vote, as 
per Instruction 26 given in ballot boxes 
to election holders.” 

C. C. HERNDON 
Cuas. Porras 
Julv 26, 1924. 

This case was carried through the 
United States District Court for the 
western district of Texas, which up- 
held the election judges in their refusal 
to allow Dr. Nixon to vote. From this 
decision appeal was taken to the United 
States Supreme Court which heard 
argument on January 5, 1927. The 
National Office of the N.A.A.C.P. em- 
ployed as counsel in this case Fred C. 
Knollenberg of El Paso, a white attor- 
ney who had been retained by Dr. 
Nixon and the El Paso Branch of the 
N.A.A.C.P. and associated with Mr. 
Knoilenberg in the preparation of the 
brief were Moorfield Storey, Presiden: 


of the N.A.A.C.P., James A. Cobb of 
Washington and Robert J. Channell of 
El Paso. 


At the hearing of the case before the 
Supreme Court in Washington Mr. 
Knollenberg was accompanied by Ar- 
thur B. Spingarn, vice-president of the 
N.A.A.C.P. and Chairman of its Na- 
tional Legal Committee. Mr. Knol- 
lenberg presented statistics showing that 
the vote of the Republican Party in 
Texas in the last election had been 
negligible; and that therefore the 
Democratic Party primaries in fact 
constituted the only opportunity for 
citizens to express themselves in the 
tlection of state and national officers. 


URING the course of the. argu- 

ment, the grave and solemn mem- 
bers of the Supreme Court manifested 
unusual interest. They asked frequent 
questions and the nature of the ques- 
tions indicated a difference in opinion 
among the judges, as to the merits of 
the case. Justice Pierce Butler, for ex- 
ample, asked questions indicating a be- 
lief that primary elections did not con- 
stitute elections under the law and that 
exclusion from party primaries did not 
therefore constitute disfranchisement. 
Chief Justice William Howard Taft, 
however, and Justice Oliver Wendell 
Holmes seemed to attach more import- 
ance to the case, as did Justice Suther- 
land and questions of Chief Justice Taft 
indicating that if it were possible to 
exclude Negroes from Democratic party 
primaries, there was no reason why 
they could not be excluded from Repub- 
lican primaries elsewhere. Mr. Knol- 
lenberg pointed out to the Supreme 
Court that the question at issue was 
the right to vote as guaranteed in the 
Fifteenth Amendment and the amend- 
ment did not specify whether the voting 
was to be in general elections or for 
candidates for office. The right con- 
ferred, Mr. Knollenberg contended, in- 
cluded the right to vote in primaries, 
in the issue of bonds and in all matters 
upon which the views of the electorate 
are to be obtained. 


HE State of Texas was not offi- 

cially represented before the Su- 
preme Court. It was noticed, however, 
that a red-haired young man was sitting 
in the Court listening intently to the 
argument and the questions of the Jus- 
tices. Mr. Spingarn followed Mr. 
Knollenberg and concluded the argu- 
ment in behalf of Dr. Nixon and the 
N.A.A.C.P. When he had finished, 
the red-haired young man jumped up 
and asked permission to file a reply 


9 


brief for the State of Texas. The 
young man was identified as Dan 
Moody, Attorney General of Texas 
and newly elected Governor of the 
State. The Supreme Court gave him 
30 days in which to file such a brief and 
the N.A.A.C.P. then applied for time 
in which to file a brief replying to 
Texas. This was granted to Mr. 
Spingarn in behalf of the N.A.A.C.P. 

In connection with this case, it should 
be borne in mind that what is involved 
is not the right to vote or to join the 
Democratic party. The case arose sole- 
ly and simply because a colored voter, 
clearly entitled to vote as a member 
of that party, was denied the right to 
participate in its primary elections be- 
cause of his color. The precedent so 
established, if allowed to go unchal- 
lenged, would be a highly dangerous 
one for the Negro as well as for all 
minority groups in the United States. 

The case raises also the vital ques- 
tion of the control by Congress over 
party primaries. It shows the incon- 
sistent position adopted by a number 
of southern Democrats in Congress, 
who contended that Congress had the 
right to regulate the expenditures of 
candidates to office in primary elections 
held in northern states but that the Fed- 
eral government was powerless to pre- 
vent barring * colored voters in the 
South. This irconsistency was clear- 
ly pointed ous by a white Southern 
daily, the Macon, Georgia, Tele- 
graph, which in an editorial of Janu- 
ary 6 stated: 

“Tt is e pected that the decision of the 
court in the Nixon-Herndon Case may 
have some bearing also on the question 
of what extent of Federal control may 
be exercised over expenditures of money 
in party primaries. The ruling may ail 
in the solution of some of the problems 
which are expected to arise in consider- 
ing the credentials of Senator Vare of 
Pennsylvania, and Senator Smith of IIli- 
nois. The Democrats who are most 
vociferous in clamoring for the exclusion 
of the two Senators because of excessive 
spending in the party races may thus be 
placed in a dilemma by insisting on Fed- 
eral jurisdiction over Republican pri- 
maries in Pennsylvania and Illinois while 
demanding that the United States Gov- 
ernment keep its hands off the Texas 
Democratic Primaries.” 

The case aroused an enormous 
amount of interest throughout the 
South for once again it manifested to 
the dominant white public opinion that 
the colored people even of Texas were 
not willing to sit quietly by while their 
constitutional rights were either whit- 
tled away or, as in the case of Dr. 
Nixon, boldly and flagrantly denied. 
The N.A.A.C.P. believes this case is 
one of the important milestones in the 
combat for the Negro’s franchise and 
citizenship rights. In the reply brief,

Clarence Darrow’s Argument in 
Sweet Case in Pamphlet Form 


ECAUSE of its great historical, 
legal and humanitarian value, the 
full argument of Mr. Clarence Dar- 
row to the jury in the trial of Henry 
Sweet has been reprinted in full by the 
N.A.A.C.P. and is now available for 
circulation. As is well known, this 
trial resulted in the jury acquittal of 
Henry Sweet, chosen by the State for 
separate trial because the State felt 
it had strongest evidence against him. 
It will also be remembered that the 
first trial in October and November, 
1925, when all eleven defendants were 
tried jointly, resulted in a hung jury. 
In addition to the full stenographic 
report of Mr. Darrow’s speech, there 
is a statement of the case also written 
by Mr. Darrow and a brief foreword. 
The N.A.A.C.P. feels that this pamph- 
let is one of the most important docu- 
ments it has ever printed. No man, 
however prejudiced, can read Mr. 
Darrow’s plea for tolerance and the 
abolition of race prejudice without 
profit. 

This publication should be in the 
hands of every person who followed 
this great trial which reaffirmed and 
preserved the right of self-defense to a 
Negro who had defended his family 
and home against the wanton assault 
of a mob. It should also be placed in 
the hands of mayors, chiefs-of-police 
and other officials of cities wherever 
there is any appreciable Negro popula- 
tion; in the hands of sheriffs of coun- 
ties and governors of states, secretaries 
of organizations like chambers of com- 
merce, Rotary clubs, women’s clubs— 
in brief, wherever there are persons in 
authority who need to know what lay 
back of the attack upon the home of 
the Sweets in Detroit. 

To gain as wide circulation as pos- 
sible, the Association is distributing this 
pamphlet at the cost of printing and 
mailing. Single copies can be secured 
from the National Office, 69 Fifth 
Avenue, New York, at 15 cents per 
copy; in lots of 100, it can be secured 
for $10 per hundred. Branches of the 
N.A.A.C.P., churches, clubs and other 
interested organizations are urged to 
aid in the widest possible distribution 
of this most important document.

reports some strange sayings, or 
perhaps more accurately strange writ- 
ings in her “Oscar Wilde from Purga- 
tory”, recently published by Holt. If 
a companion volume might be launched 
entitled ““To Oscar Wilde in Purga-

our terra firma, I doubt if any one 
thing would bring more astonishment 
to the exotic author of that delightful 
drawing-room melodrama, “Lady Win- 
dermere’s Fan’, than the plain fact 
that a Negro College Alumnae Club 
successfully presented the play before 
an appreciative Negro audience. 

On the evening of December the 
third an interesting cast presented this 
English comedy of manners in Charles- 
ton, West Virginia, under the direc- 
tion of Mrs. T. G. Nutter. The stage 
of the Garnett High School was entire- 
ly inadequate to give proper setting. 
Yet this handicap was skillfully over- 
come by scenic effects, utilizing the 
meager space by deft illusion of light- 
ing and of color. Incidental music was

Cameron White,—a comprehension for 
what the stage lacked in giving tone 
and background to the performance. 

The costumes were perfect, “a la 
mode’? however, and not of the eigh- 
teen nineties. 

The acting was not of professional 
calibre of course, but showed those la- 
tent possibilities of the amateur which 
training and experience often raise to 
the professional class. 

Particularly noteworthy were the 
fine interpretation of Theodore Nash 
in the role of Lord Windermere, the 
poise of Clara Savoy as Lady Winder- 
mere and the sophisticated impersona- 
tion by Vera Powell of the clever, the 
daring Mrs. Erlynne. The remainder 
of the players gave intelligent render- 
ing of their parts. 

It was at the beginning of Thomas 
Beer’s “The Mauve Decade’, when 
Wilde first produced his witty tour de 
force. Then the Negro was the jester 
of the American stage, the buffoon of 
the gallery gods, the slap-stick clown 
of audiences that reveled in his special 
fitness to play the fool. Now Gilpin

In Abraham’s Bosom 
‘«¢<— N ABRAHAM’S BOSOM” is a 


play written by a young southern 
white man, Paul Green, and produced 
at the Provincetown Theatre, New 
York, with all colored actors, save two. 
The acting is excellent. The work of 
Julius Bledsoe, Abbie Mitchell, and 
Rose McClendon is particularly good: 
the other actors sustain well difficult 
parts. 

But the play itself, or rather, as we 
understand it, the combination of sev- 
eral plays into this one is not good. It 
is ill-+alanced. The strain upon the 
audience which comes from listening to 
a long play in seven scenes which be- 
gins with the whipping of a human be- 
ing and culminates in a lynching, with 
few spots of light and none of hope, is 
too terrible. The climax of horror, 
murder and disappointment in the sixth 
scene goes right on to a further climax 
in the seventh. It is not a question of 
truth; such things have happened in the 
South and are happening, but it is a 
question of art and balance, of getting 
the story over. 

Paul Green is a sympathetic author. 
He feels with his black folk. But he 
and his producers between them have

presented the same defeatist genre of 
Negro art which is so common and at 
the present apparently inescapable. It 
arises from the fact that the more 
honestly and sincerely a white artist 
looks at the situation of the Negro ir 
America the less is he able to consider 
it in any way bearable and therefore 
his stories and plays must end in lynch- 
ing, suicide or degeneracy. 

If after looking further and seeing 
the Negro group, noting its bounding 
energy and sturdy refusal to take de- 
feat, the artist tries to give his black 
hero a degree of triumph, spiritual or 
physical, he meets, usually, the absolute 
refusal of the producer: “It can’t be 
done”; “the audience won’t stand it”; 
ncthing but disaster must follow self- 
assertion and success among black folk 
on the American stage. 

I can but think that this is but pure 
assumption and that the time has come 
for the Negro to be treated humanly on 
the stage, not only as to his suffering, 
but as to his plain and unquestionable 


triumphs. W. E. B. D.

The Wasters

WE flung our land away like drunken 
bums; 
Used up our forests with a blithe dis- 
dain; 
Gave out the People’s heritage to those 
Who robbed and re-robbed in the name 
of Law. 
We worked men too long hours, too late 
in life; 
Began with children too young to demur; 
Harassed poor women wrecked by waves 
of chance 
Until they knuckled down to those who 
bought. 
Our States in rare magnificence of graft 
on gold like swill to bosses’ favored 
ew; 
Our Congress squandered millions year 
by year 
With Business Inefficiency its God. 
Too proud to learn from older lands 
than ours, 
Too childish to admit our weaknesses 
We flung our bodies, minds and souls 
away— 
Boastful, weak, arrogant, poor, selfish 
fools.

not touch the things made out of mud. 
If the dried ones fall, they break. If 
the moist ones are molested, be it with 
ever so gentle a finger, they lose their 
shape. Moreover, I must not disturb 
Dora. 

Her little hands are busied with the 
mud. Little moulder’s fingers are 
deftly plying their skill. Her child’s 
face is alight. What has splashed her 
grave child’s face with such a light? 
I wondered. I wonder now. The 
glitter of brittle talent, a gleam of 
sterling genius or the glow from artistic 
fires burning within the soul of a little 


black child? 
ITTLE DORA shaping figures out 


of mud. Vases and urns, dolls and 
toys, flying birds and trotting horses, 
frisking dogs and playing kittens, mar- 
velous things out of mud. Crying aloud 
as though dealt a blow if one of the 
dried mud-figures is broken. Working 
in mud for endless hours, while the 
neighbor children play. Their hilari- 
ous merriment dropping like bombs in- 
to the quiet of our clean-swept corner. 
Deadly missiles seeking to find a mark. 
The insistent halloes of futile mirth 
forever bubbling on the other side of a 
high-board fence. The dividing fence 
and upon one side the clean-swept cor- 
ner and the row on row of mud things 
drying in the sun. And Dora seem- 
ing not to heed the seething bubbles 
upon the other side, shaping, shaping 
marvelous things out of mud. 

Yet, Oh Dora, now that the day is 
ours, will you not say, “When did the 
bombs of futile mirth strike their tar- 
get? When did the tin-cans and the 
rags and the old ash-heap crowd you 
out from your clean-swept corner? 
What rude hand caused the dried mud 
shapes to fall and break? Who set a 
ruthless foot in the midst of your damp 
mud things?” Or were you too plastic, 
as plastic as your mud? You dare not 
tell. Only this you can whisper into 
the mists of our today. You are one 
of the Master’s unfinished shapes which 
He will some day gather to mould 
anew into the finished masterpiece. 


LUMP of mud. Now, there is 
a sobriquet for you—you funny, 
funny man. Mr. William Williams. I 





saw you but once. We chanced to meet 
in the home of a mutual friend. I 
thought you so very funny then. Un- 
couth and very boorish, but ever, when 
these pageants of the past, these dumb 
shows of inarticulate folks arise before 
me upon retrospective days, you appear 
garbed in the tatters of pathos. 

“T am fifty-one years old,” you kept 
repeating. How pitiful those fifty-one 
years are. You wear a child’s simplic- 
ity, the sort that is so sad to see upon a 
man. Fifty-one and penniless. Fifty- 
one and possessed of naught else but 
the clothing you wore. Fifty-one and 
no place on earth you might call home. 
You confessed to being a vagabond 
though “bum” was the term you used 
and you were very proud of your one 
accomplishment, an ability to avoid all 
labour. 

“T’ve given no man a full day’s 
honest work in all my fifty-one years,” 
you boasted. “lI gambles. I ain’t no 
cotton-pickin’ nigger.” Your one and 
only boast after holding life, the 
fathomless fountain of eternal possibili- 
ties, in your possession for fifty-one 
priceless years. 

Nevertheless you have lived and so 
intensely. You held us against our will. 
Clustered around you, listening to you 
talk. Relating clippings as it were 
from the scrap-book of your life. 

Tales of the road, of the only places 
you knew. Roads leading away from 
plantations where the cotton waited to 
be picked by numberless “cotton-pickin’ 
niggers”. Roads leading to pool halls 
and gambling dens. Roads beginning 
and roads ending in “riding the roads”, 
carrying backward and forward, here 
and yon through the weird goblin land 
of the South’s black belt. 

With a hardened casualness you 
told stories that revolted and at the 
same time cheered us with an all 
sufficing glow of thankfulness that life 
had spared us the sordidness of yours. 
Offhandily, you gave us humourous 
skits that tempered our laughter with 
wishes that we might know at least a 
bit of such a droll existence as had been 
yours. With magical words you painted 
pictures so sharply they cut scars upon 
our hearts. You drew others so filled 
with rollicking delight their gladsome- 
ness was contagious. With the non- 
chalance of a player shuffling cards you 
flipped your characters before us, drawn 
directly from the cesspool of your con- 
tacts and spellbound we listened. 

Someone remarked how wonderful

Calendar Chat 


HAT takes place in March? 

Winds blow! How quickly we 
would think of this. But there is 
much to tell of plants and birds busied 
with March’s program, for this is a 
month of purpose. Here are March 
notes from two diaries, one of nine- 
teen hundred and twelve, the other o1 
many years later. 

March 21, 1912. You should see 
the great round red buds on the maple 
trees! 

The pointed russet buds on our pop- 
lar tree are an inch and a half long. 

Branches on the briar rose bush are 
moss green. 

Many years later. March 21. Car- 
dinal’s bold whistle, Bluebird’s gentle 
murmur, Mourning Dove’s sad alto, 
Song Sparrow’s sharp piping have been 
preparing my ears for this—Robin’s 
sturdy song. Business has begun. The 
Robins have arrived. Now for nest 
building with true masonry. 

Yet all winter I had believed it was 
the Bluebirds | was most anxious to 
see. I have been watching the little 
bird house on a pole in the side yard 
and longing for the coming of the 
Wrens and Bluebirds. While scatter- 
ing crumbs along the walk or placing 
cracked nuts on the windowsills for 
the Jays and Titmice and Chickadees 
I have continued to look longingly to- 
ward the empty bird house with snow 
on its little roof and doorsills and in 
gazing at the black spots that were 
all the entrances showed of a barren in- 
side I have thought, “Never mind. 
Bluebirds are coming”’. 

But when they get here they never 
do anything great like Robin. Fancy 
their being content to start house- 
keeping quietly in some old Wood- 
pecker hollow or a home placed for 
them on a pole. Can you imagine 
Robin or Oriole starting the season in 
this fe-hion? And yet what lovable 
neighbors are Bluebird and Wren! 

That reminds me. I know a lady 
who lives on a river bank. There are 
water willows in her back yard and a 
few days ago I was looking toward 
these for a glimpse of the frozen river 
beyond. I cannot tell you of the 
strange beauty of this water in the 
winter. I am sure some Japanese 
painter would love to make a dainty 
drawing of it, with the somber willows 
walling its grayish white and frosted 
green. 

In searching through the willows 
for the river I discovered two swing-

ing bird houses that were the color of 
the trees. I forgot all about the river 
and began to ask questions concerning 
the little boxes. Wrens often built 
there, I was told. It must make 
things lively for the gray old willows 
to have such cheery creatures summer- 
ing there. Indeed I know the willow 
boughs are shaking now with pleasure. 
For Wren time is nearly here! 


Time for Kites! 


66 IME for kites, heigho!’’, cried 
March Wind as he sped over 
sea and land. 

“Aye, aye, sir’, promptly answered 
a red-faced seaman on the Jolly John- 
ny and he hoisted the sky-sails. 

But March Wind hurried off. For 
he had not wished to play with what 
the man beneath the sails called 
“kites”, the high flying-jib topsails. 
Oh, no! 

“Time for kites”, March Wind 


sang out again as he crossed over the 
water and reached the land. 

“Very well”, called a keen-eyed bird 
with long graceful wings. “It really 
seems rather early for the beetles and 
locusts and grasshoppers upon which 
I feed. But you said “Time for kites’ 
and I’m a ‘kite’, you know.” 

“Oh, no, I did not mean you at all”, 
snapped the March Wind shortly. “I 
forgot there was a falcon-like bird 
called a ‘kite’.” 

Then he sped on nearer the ground 
and cried again, “Time for kites”. 

“Good”, shouted Harold Laddy 
who was homeward bound from 
school, “I'll get my kite right away”. 

And off he ran. 

“Hurry, hurry, hurry!’ cried 
March Wind flying after him, satis- 
fied this time, for ‘he, like the boys, 
loved to play with paper kites. In- 
deed when March Wind failed to join 
the kite-flyers they had little success.

MUSIC AND ART 


@ Roland Hayes’ tour of the South has 
met with unqualified success. During

WHAT TO READ | 





HE outstanding book of the month 
is Langston Hughes’ second book 
of poems, “Fine Clothes to the Jew”. 
It is a beautifully printed little volume 
of eighty-nine pages issued by Knopf 
and has, like “The Weary Blues”, “the 
fine qualities of force, passion, direct- 
ness and sensitive perception”. There 
are extraordinarily beautiful bits here 
and there and while the poems dis- 
tinctly confine themselves to lowly 
types, it is the human feeling and long- 
ing there that he emphasizes. Despair 
at sunset: 

“A good woman’s cryin’ 

For a no-good man?” 

The spittoon cleaner who puts his 
lowly offering on the altar of the Lord; 
the porter 

“Climbing up.a great big mountain 

Of yes, sirs!” 

The cry of the religious mourners: 

“QO, ma little Jesus, 

Please reach out yo’ hand.” 

Of individual poems one must read 
the rhythm and abandon of “Saturday 
Night”; the little “Sun Song”; and 
the tragic “Song for a Dark Girl”. 
And then there are phrases here and 
there: 

“A passing girl with purple pow- 
dered skin”; 

“T’m midnight mad”; 

“I’m waiting for ma mammy,— 
She is Death.” 

And one line which is a sort of key 
to the book: 

“‘Loud-mouthed laughers in the hands 
Of Fate.” 

The book is $2 and has a jacket by 
Aaron Douglas. You should buy it. 


HE muse of William Augustus 
Banks (“Beyond the Rockies”, 
Dorrance) is not strong or striking, 
but it has merit. 
“T put my hand on the breast of the 
sea 
But the sea paid me no mind; 
And because the sea didn’t stop for me, 
I said: ‘O the sea is blind!’” 


HE report of the Association Uni- 

versitaire Catholique d’ Aide aux 
Missions, on Catholic missions among 
the Indians and Negroes of Oklahoma, 
by Urbain de Hasque, contains a strik- 
ing indictment of Catholic listlessness 
toward American Negroes. It says 
(page 104): “Native Clergy for 150 
Years: There have been only eighi 
Catholic priests of Negro blood in 
North America. The first was P.

Augustus Tolton, ordained at Rome 
1888, died in 1902; Joseph Plantvigne, 
ordained at Baltimore in 1907, died 
1913; and the following six who are 
still alive: Randolph Uncles, ordained 
1891, Professor at Epiphany College, 
Baltimore; John Dorsey, ordained 
1902, Curate at St. Monica, Balti- 
more; Joseph Burgess, ordained 1907, 
Professor at the Apostolic School at 
Cornwells, Pennsylvania; Steven L. 
Theobold, ordained 1910, attached to 
the colored parish at St. Paul; Joseph 
John, ordained 1923; Norman Duck- 
ett, ordained February, 1926.” There 
is one seminary for Negroes and this 
was not established until 1920. There 
are six colored schools in the South; 
two congregations of colored nuns, one 
in Baltimore and one in New Orleans, 
with 311 membeis. There are not 
more than 250,000 colored Catholics in 
the country and the Catholics have 
only $1,250,000 invested in the work 
of evangelizing the Negroes! Among 
the sixty-eight colored schools and 
colleges “there is not a single Catholic 
college”. 


ARTER WOODSON’S “The 
Mind of the Negro as Reflected in 
Letters Written during the Crisis 
1800-1860”, a thick volume of 671 
pages, is another one of this scholar’s 
invaluable contributions to Negro his- 
tory. It costs $5, but it ought to be 
in most of our libraries. After all, 
what do even we who are dark know 
of what our fathers and grandfathers 
thought? And a white man said: “How 
much would I give if I could just get 
into the mind of that Negro for a 
few moments and see the world from 
his point of view.” This book allows 
us all to do this for the first sixty 
years of the 19th century. 


NYONE who wants a short, fair 

statement of the problem of “The 
Negro in American Life” should buy 
Willis J. King’s little seventy-five cent 
volume in the World’s Friendship 
Series, published by the Methodist 
Book Concern. In 154 pages he has 
outlined with references, quotations 


De 


and comments “an elective course for 
young people on Christian race rela- 
tionship”. The work seems thorough 
and well done. 


In the Magazines 


RNOLD HOLLRIEGEL writes 
in The Living Age, January 1, 
1927, on the “West Indian Pepper 
Pct”. As the background he relates 
the story of the pepper pot, under which 
the fire never dies from one generation 
to the next. It is just a continuous 
simmering, stewing and mixing. Little 
by little the islands are becoming the 
home of a new European-veneered Ne- 
gro race. The author says: “Europe 
is already dancing to the Negro’s tom 
tom.” 

Colin Ross writes on “The Black 
and White of It”. The article first 
appeared in the Vossische Zeitung, a 
Berlin liberal daily paper, October 16, 
24, 26, 1926. It is translated in The 
Living Age, January 15, 1927. The 
impossibility of building South Africa 
on white labor alone makes black labor 
a necessity. All the heavy work is 
done by the blacks who have few poli- 
tical rights. Segregation in the past 
was carried out in the strictest form, 
but now that agriculture is not the only 
industry and opportunities have come 
to the blacks through the mines and 
manufactures, the editors and mission- 
aries are making themselves felt and 
conditions are becoming better. 

Round Table, England, December 
1926, publishes ““A Covered Wagon in 
Africa”. This article was reprinted 
in The Living Age for January 15. 
It is the story of the great Ngami trek 
and is a colorful and encyclopedic de- 
scription of the settling of Ghansi. 

“Race Questions in South Africa”, 
by Patric Duncan, appears in Foreign 
Affairs, January, 1927. The whole 
article is permeated with the white 
man’s apprehension for the future of 
his own race in Africa. The non- 
European peoples in South Africa fall 
in three groups. First, the native popu- 
lation; second, the colored people of 
mixed race; third, the Asiatic popula- 
tion. The native population out-num- 
bers the other two groups. The Euro- 
pean invasion came about 270 years 
ago and since then the European has 
introduced his civilization but he is 
seeing it turned against him by the

Tue Crisis 














FROM OUR SCRAP BOOK 


The New York Nation’s Honor 
Roll for 1926 has these entries: 


Clarence Darrow and Arthur Garfield 
Hays, for pleading and winning the cause 
of race justice in Detroit. 

Walter F. White, for crossing the 
color line at the risk of his life and dis- 
covering the Aiken lynchers. 


This ought to increase interest in 
this advertisement in the New York 
Times: 


AUGUSTA—AIKEN 


In Augusta, Ga., and Aiken, S. C., out- 
door life prevails throughout the entire 
winter. These are healthful and delight- 
ful resorts for vacations during the win- 
ter months, amid ideal surroundings. 
Varied amusements invite open air life— 
golf, polo, tennis, motoring, riding and 
driving. 


We clip from a contemporary: 

My niece, a little girl of 5, had a Bible 
given her. She always thought she must 
entertain callers, and one day she said: 
“My mother is reading a book. The 
name of it is “The Crisis’. And I have 
a new book. My book is about Jesus 
Crisis.” 


The Commission on Inter-racial Co- 
operation of Atlanta issued a leaflet 
which says: 

A college student gravely informed 
me the other day that God tufned one 
of Noah’s sons black and sentenced his 
descendants to perpetual servitude. He 
spent a half hour searching the Bible to 
prove it. He didn’t find it, of course, 
for the Bible says nothing of the kind. 
There is no suggestion that God cursed 
anybody or that anybody was turned 
black. (Read Genesis 9 and see for 
yourself). The scientists tell use that 
our color variations are due to the in- 
fluence of climate and environment work- 
ing through long ages. Probably we 
were all red at first; the name Adam 
means “red earth’, you know. Then 
those of us who settled in the North 
faded out, while those farther South 
grew darker. 


The following paragraph is clipped 
from a Virginia newspaper: 

“A Negro in Pittsburgh won a parole 
for his youngest son when he told the 
court ‘this is the best of my 35 children’. 
The flower of this large flock pleaded 
guilty to larceny. If this theft involved 
a chicken roost, it is not difficult to un- 


derstand the father’s high estimation of 
his son.” 


March, 1927 





THE FAR HORIZON 


It is the first time in many years that 
we have seen that stale jest in print, and 
we had hoped that it was a thing of the 
past. Doubtless the scribbler who wrote 
the paragraph above quoted meant no of- 
fense, but all such jests naturally are 
offensive to honest and respectable col- 
ored people, for they are a slur at the 
race, and there is nothing funny in a 
jest that gives offense. Real politeness 
is consideration for the feelings of others, 
and colored people are as much entitled 
as any other people to that sort of con- 
sideration. There is no excuse for re- 
ferring to them as “niggers”, or even as 
“darkies”; no excuse for employing any 
term of designation which is derogatory 
to the race or offensive to colored men 
and women of refined sensibilities. 
There is no color line in manners. 


Newport News, Virginia, Daily Press. 


Panama, C. Z., 1923.—‘‘Native side” 
of city. Mid-afternoon. Myself stop- 
ping two American privates in the nar- 
row winding main street to ask the way 
to a shop. Cordial greetings, naive in- 
terest, sidewalk chat of several minutes. 
Both of them from Iowa. Offer to 
guide me to the place. We start along 
abreast. Twice I fall a step behind to 
let natives pass us on sidewalk. Notice 
privates elbow passers into the roadway. 
On my third attempt, one says, giving me 
a friendly tip: “Oh, don’t get out of the 
way for them. We never do that for 
them lazy niggers down here.” 


The New Masses. 


Just to show the folly to which silly 
race discrimination can go was exempli- 
fied at the Y. M. C. A. the other day 
when a group of boys of all nations from 
the Church of All Nations, composed of 
Italians, Mexicans, Negroes, Japanese, 
and cther nationalities were invited to 
that institution on one of its functions. 
They got along all right until the mat- 
ter of a little swim in the pool was the 
order of the hour. Then some pygmy 
representative of the great white race got 
busy and excluded the Negroes from 
swimming with those of the invited 
group. If that grade of slavery is a 
symptom of white superiority socially or 
otherwise, we Negroes don’t want it. 
Fortunate was it that Dr. G. Bromley 
Onom, the pastor of the Church of All 
Nations, got through the Methodist 
Preachers Meeting a resolution condemn- 
ing the act as brutal and un-Christian 
and demanding that Methodist Churches 
withdraw their support from that insti- 
tution until a more sensible treatment 
of all race groups can be maintained. 
Isn’t it strange that some white people 
of average intelligence are favorable to 


such ignorant, backward southern non- 
sense and brutal discourtesy.

VOTES FOR BLACK FOLK 


Nobody, not even the people of the 
South, will seriously contend with Sena- 
tor Caraway of Arkansas, that the right 
of the Negroes in his state is uncon- 
tested. 

If what he says is so, why is it that 
but eight per cent of the population in 
Arkansas votes and in Mississippi the 
percentage is one point less? 

To say that the polls are as free and 
safe for Arkansans as are the polls for 
Massachusetts people is going a long dis- 
tance. Twenty-nine per cent of our pop- 
ulation votes. 

Why should the Arkansas senator be 
so shocked on account of the question- 
able method by which Mr. Vare of 
Pennsylvania and Mr. Smith of Illinois 
secured their senatorial credential when 
it is openly admitted in his own state 
that, for obvious reasons, Negroes do not 
vote? 

The Arkansas senator may be right in 
his position on the Vare and Smith cases 
and what is here said is not to be taken as 
a defense of their claims, but to get right 
down to brass tacks, Senator Caraway 
has no more right to a seat in the senate 
than Smith or Vare. 

This is just a case of the pot calling 
the kettle black. 


Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Eagle. 


Former Governor Dunne of Illinois 
has discovered another reason why Smith 
should be allowed to take his seat in the 
senate. He says the entire question of 
state rights is at stake. To refuse to 
accept Smith’s credentials would be to 
destroy the last vestige of state sover- 
eignty, he declares. 

He furthermore points out that a re- 
fusal to accept Smith’s credentials would 
establish a precedent dangerous to the 
Democratic party in the South, for, fol- 
lowing that precedent, the senate might 
refuse to accept the credentials of any 
Democrat elected in any southern state 
in which the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the Constitution gives the Negro the 
right of suffrage, alleging as a reason for 
such refusal that Negroes had not been 
permitted to exercise that right.

JUSTICE 


Jake Hilton, Negro, of Jasper county, 
was pardoned on Wednesday by Gover- 
nor Henry L. Whitfield, according to in- 
formation just given out at the offices 


21 





of the state prison Thursday afternoon. 

Hilton was sentenced three years in 
August, 1925, for grand larceny. 

In giving his reason for granting the 
pardon, Governor Whitfield said: “This 
case grew out of a charge of stealing 
cotton for which this man was convicted. 
A letter from the person owning the said 
cotton states that it now develops that 
Hilton did not commit the act, but it was 
done by a white man or men, and he has 
been paid for the cotton which was 
stolen. At the time of the trial the ac- 
cused Negro did not testify because of 
it being dangerous for him to do so.” 


Jackson, Mississippi, Daily News. 


On December 8th a Negro man, whose 
name was not reported to the executive 
department, is alleged to have shot and 
killed a white man in a little community 
in Harris county, near West Point. A 
gang of less than a dozen white men, 
claiming they were merely going to lo- 
vate the Negro, who had escaped and 
was }'ding out, and whose intention was 
to fing the Negro and turn him over to 
the sheriff of the county, started out as 
a self-constituted posse. 

During the night they stopped at the 
hut of a Negro eight miles from West 
Point and awakened the occupants. De- 
roanding that they be allowed to search 
the house, they were admitted, and 
found that the Negro boy, Ransom, aged 
14 years old, was the only male occupant 
of the cabin. Ransom joined the men 
in their search of the place, according to 
the story told to the governor’s office by 
the sheriff. In fact, Ransom held the 
lamp so the white men could make their 
search under the beds, and through the 
cabin. 

When every corner of the Negro cabin 
had been examined, the man wanted was 
not found, and the gang was about to 
depart, when one of the number turned 
to the boy, Ransom, and made the re- 
mark: “We've just got to get one nig- 
ger, anyhow,” and fired on the Negro 
lad, killing him. 


Columbus, Georgia, Inguirer-Sun. 


Congress should pass the anti-lynching 
law pending before it. The lynching of 
Negroes is a national disgrace. In the 
South it is engaged in as part of the 
policy of “keeping the blacks in their 
place”. Negroes in the South are re- 
garded as inferior to whites, no matter 
how depraved, cruel and useless a white 
may be. Any white man, they believe, 
is better than a black or colored one. 

The idea is wickedly and cruelly false. 
It therefore produces nothing but wick- 
edness and cruelty. And in doing it 
brings world-wide disgrace upon the 
United States. 

The South will not correct the evil 
itself. It becomes necessary, therefore, 
to make the crime of lynching a Federal 
concern. It becomes the more necessary 
to do this because there have been inci- 
dents of lynching in the North and the 
steady migration of Negroes from the 
South appears to be encouraging the evil. 

The crime of lynching must be abol- 
ished from America. Since the South, 


22 





the chief offender, will not stop it, the 
nation through Congress must assume 
the responsibility. 

Philadelphia, Pa., Daily News. 


“ALL IN A DAY’S WORK” 


I began the work of yesterday by eat- 
ing breakfast at the restaurant in the 
Union Station, the only place in the 
city and probably the only place in the 
state or the entire South where white 
people will satisfy a Negro’s hunger 
by serving him meals in the same res- 
taurant and at the same table where 
whites are served. I ate my _break- 
fast freely like other hungry men with 
a white man on one side and a white 
woman on the other, neither of whom 
I knew or cared to know or expected 
to see again and neither of whom 
knew or cared to know or expected to 
see me again. Aren’t our white people 
silly along some lines? 

In the evening I was the guest of the 
executive officer, a southern white man, 
of the only regular organized colored 
boy scout troops in the United States at 
the only colored scout camp in the 
United States. We went out to the camp 
on an Inter-urban car. On approaching 
the station my southern white friend re- 
marked that although I was his guest 
and although we were engaged in prac- 
tically the same work and had much to 
talk about, we could not ride together 
for I must take the “Jim Crow” com- 
partment. “It’s a darn shame,” said he, 
“that we can not ride together. Of all 
the silly laws this ‘Jim Crow’ law is the 
silliest,” a sentiment to which I readily 
and heartily agreed. 

At the camp I was served supper with 
my white friend and at the evening camp 
fire I listened to an address of the execu- 
tive officer of the white troops and to a 
white scout who had come from a near- 
by white scout camp to sound and ex- 
plain the numerous bugle calls in the 
routine of the day. When it came my 
turn to speak, I held up to these black 
scouts the records of such men as Roland 
Hayes, Booker Washington, Prof. Car- 
ver, Dr. DuBois, and others. 

The colored boys related this story to 
me: In the afternoon they had been out 
on a long hike and in returning passed 
the white scout camp. These white 
youngsters signalled, “Who are you?” 
The response came back, “Colored 
Scouts”. The white scouts signalled 
again, “Come over and visit us”. The 
colored scouts went over and spent a half 
hour yelling and singing and talking with 
their white fellow scouts. These south- 
ern white boys observing that the Negro 
scouts were tired and dusty from their 
hike said, “Come on and take a swim in 
our pool”. The colored boys responded 
and had the swim of their lives. The 
white scouts served the colored scouts 
with candies and sent a supply to the col- 
ored boys who remained at the camp. 

On my return to the city my friend 
said, “I’ll be darned if I don’t ride with 
you in the ‘Jim Crow’ car and if the 
conductor makes any objection, I'll cuss 
him out”. And ride with me he did. 
We compromised by riding in the white 





smoker compartment with none to molest 
or make afraid. 
Can you beat it? 


GEORGIA 


“In country districts children were 
frequently kept from school to work on 
the farms, and the school attendance 
law offered no way to combat this cus- 
tom. One school superintendent stated 
that work was obligatory for all the 
children in tenant families who could 
follow a plow, as this was the arrange- 
ment of the tenant with his landlord, 
who otherwise would not hire him... . 

“Both in the country and in the towns 
it was reported that many parents were 
so shiftless that they did not care whether 
their children received an education or 
not. Being illiterate themselves, they 
did not appreciate the benefits of an 
education. 

“The attendance problem among 
Negro children was complicated by the 
fact that often the school was absent 
from the child, rather than the child 
from the school. Most of the schools 
for Negro children were entirely inade- 
quate and poorly equipped and staffed. It 
was said that as a rule the parents were 
anxious to have their children attend, 
almost the only effort to keep the Negro 
child in school being made by members 
of his own race. If all the Negro chil- 
dren of compulsory school age were com- 
pelled to go to school there would be no 
place to put them, as there were not suf- 
ficient accommodations for those actually 
attending.”

The Maryland Inter-racial Com- 
mission reports these wages for school 
teachers in the state: 
Elementary Schools White 





Colored 


3rd grade .... $600- 650 $320- 450 

2nd grade .... 750- 850  400- 600

“The Commission recommends the 
principle of equal pay, grade by grade, 
as shown by the standards of school clas- 
sification and teachers certificates toward 
attaining this standard without regard to 
color. The State of Maryland should 
proceed promptly and vigorously in this 
matter. Well trained, efficient teachers 
with experience can hardly be secured or 
retained in any other way. It costs the 
colored teacher as much as one of any 


other group to secure an education and’ 


to live while teaching school. We re- 
quest that the Board of Education, the 
Governor and the Legisiature take this 
matter into immediate consideration.”

standing players increases each year as 
foot ball gets firmer hold upon 
Negro colleges. We believe the men 
placed on the First Team at the head 
of this article would come out victors 
in any gridiron engagement that might 
be staged against any Negro college 
eleven. 


T end we have Turner, West 

Virginia, and Williams, Langs- 
ton, experienced wing men and backs. 
Both are excellent snatchers of passes, 
fast and hard to stop. Turner 
played at both quarter back and 
end for his school and shone brilliantly 
in both positions. But it was as end, 
in 1926, that Turner played his best 
game. Quick to get through the 
enemy’s line, he often advanced thirty 
and forty yards before the ball was 
passed and he seldom failed to hold 
the sphere when he could get his hands 
on it. Often, too, he raced several 
yards after a catch before he was 
downed. 

Williams was a terror in every game 
in which he was a participant. His 
running, catching of passes, tackling 
and kicking, brought his opponents to 
make efforts to stop him wherever he 
played. He was a tower of strength 
in every engagement and he usually 
made gains whenever called on. 

For tackles Miller, North Carolina 
A. & T., and Lamar, Atlanta, are 
chosen. They had no equals during the 
year. Both are deadly tacklers, both 
are line smashers, both can block 
superbly and both know the game of 
breaking up the enemy’s plays. De- 
fensively and offensively they outplayed 
all tackles who faced them. 

Jennings, Paul Quinn, and Redd, 
Wiley, were the best guards of the 
1926 season. Every member of their 
enemies’ teams knew they were in the 
game. ‘They made themselves felt on 
every play. Their ability to dig deep 
into the enemy’s territory on both de- 
fense and offense brought victory to 
their teams in many contests. 

The greatest center Negro foot ball 
has seen for many years was Buchanan, 
Wilberforce. Roving here and there, 
he frequently mowed down the ball 
carrier when the efforts of all other 
members of his team had failed to stop 
the enemy’s advance. He played win- 
ning foot ball every week-end. As a 
passer back, he was both brilliant and 
brainy. His passes never went wide of 
their mark. He could be depended 
upon to give his best on every play and 
his fighting spirit instilled pep into all 
players who were members of the Wil- 
berforce varsity. He was everywhere 


March, 1927 


during the game and aiways where 
he was needed. 

C. Smith, Howard, Ritchie, Wilber- 
force, Stevenson, Tuskegee, and Coles, 
Howard, constituted the strongest 
backfield in Negro college foot ball. All 
four are great runners, kickers, pass- 
ers, pass catchers and tacklers. C. 
Smith was Howard’s most used and 
most dependable half back. He al- 
ways “delivered che goods” when he 
“carried the mail”. He can hit a line 
hard and with telling effect and he can 
make his way through the narrowest 
opening. In the open he runs like “a 
scared deer”. 

Ritchie is a power at all angles of 
the game. At carrying the ball, at 
kicking and at catching passes, he had 
ne peer. Dodging, ducking, twisting 
and squirming, he went through the 
line of the opposition for gain after 
gain. His goal kicking caused his 
enemies to respect him, for most of his 
attempts at field goals counted for 
scores. On defense he was a demon 
at tackling and bringing down passes. 

Stevenson was the mainstay of 
Tuskegee in almost every game and 
the South’s outstanding backfield man. 
He can be relied upon to make the al- 
most impossible and the most unex- 
pected play when the game is close and 
the team needs encouragement and 
inspiration. Ripping the line, plung- 
ing into the enemy’s camp, darting into 
holes, escaping tacklers and making 
substantial gains, he won the admmira- 
tion of foot ball fans everywhere. 
His opponents often concentrated their 
stiffest resistance upon him, but he 
fought his hardest and his best when the 
fighting of the enemy was most stub- 
born. 


Coles possesses an almost unerring 
judgment in unraveling his opponents’ 
plays. He exhibits the same sort of 
ability in planning attacks upon the 
enemy, while his educated toe seldom 
fails to add the point after touchdown. 
Coles is a fine ball carrier, a brilliant 
snatcher of passes and a dangerous open 
field runner. He is Howard’s out- 
standing star and the greatest quarter 
back of the season. Brainy, cautious, 
determined and cool, he outgeneraled 
and outplayed every quarter back 
against whom he performed. 


HE players on the second and 

third teams were second and third 
only to the men named on the teams 
above them. Russ, Shields, McPher- 
son, Parker, Epps, Williams, Joyner, 
Branch make splendid backfields and 
if they played together would give their 
enemy much to worry about. The line- 
men are splendid players who would 
perform wonderful foot ball stunts in 
every contest.

sorter wanted to write books. Once, I 
uster read a heaps. See times when 
I was broke and nobody would stake 
me for a game. I’d lay around and 
read. I’ve read the Bible through and 
through and every Police Gazette I 
could lay my hands on. Yes, suh, I’ve 
read a’heap. And I’ve wished a lot’er 
times I’d sense enough to write a 
book.” 

Lump of mud. Containing the you, 
the splendid artist in you, the soul of 
you, the unfinished you in the ungainly 
lump of you, awaiting the gathering-up 
to be moulded anew into the finished 
masterpiece. 

What a day! Here is my friend at 
whose fire-side I have lingered behold- 
ing Mr. William Williams, great lump 
of mud. To be sure, she also is an un- 
finished production. Though it is ap- 
parent that the Master had all but 
done when she slipped from his hands 
and dropped to earth to lie groping like 
the rest of us thereon. 

Let us sit here together, friend, and 
enjoy this day. 

I shall try to discover what recent 
gift you have given to the poor the 
while you are quietly stitching upon the 
garments, linens and scarlet, with 
which to clothe your household. Sit 
here and smile with the welcoming 
light in your eyes, knowing that your 
door is open to such as William Will- 
iams and Dora Johns, the Dora who 
is become as the mud beneath one’s 
feet. Kind mistress of the widely opened 
door where white and black, rich and 
poor, of whatever caste or creed may 
enter and find comfort and ease and 
food and drink.

March, 1927 


Let me sit awhile beside you upon 
this day, hearkening again to your 
simple philosophy. A philosophy stir- 
red with the spoon of kindliness and 
seasoned with the essence of love. Very 
simple indeed and yet sufficient to sus- 
tain you in every trial and of such 
resilience it rebounds in the presence of 
tribulations unto itself and findeth 
peace. 

What is it you say to back-biters and 
gossips, all those who wrongfully ac- 
cuse you? “Everything will come out 
in the wash.” 

And when a haughty one is deing su- 
perior? “Birds fly high but they come 
down to get water.” 

And when something or someone has 
failed you in duty or in word? “Every 
tub has to stand on its own bottom.” 

And your simple panacea for intoler- 
ance? “M..n is ‘apt’ to fall as sparks 
to go upwards.” 

What boon would I not forswear to 
sit beside you in reality, my friend, who 
boasts no art save the art of friendli- 
ness ? 

Friendliness encased in a crust of 
black mud, awaiting also the Master’s 
final touch, when all outer semblances 
and material hindrances shall fade into 
nothingness and His gifts, be they the 
one talent or the five, shall be poured 
into His scales. 

So thinking, retrospection suddenly 
done with, retracing with leaps and 
bounds the journey through the fields 
of memory, I arrive at the stile of the 
present. Whereon there is a sign as 
vividly lined as the present is drawn 
from the past and the future from the 
present. Quite plainly it reads: 

“We one and all are God’s un- 
finished shapes, ungainly lumps of mud, 
waiting—waiting to be moulded anew 
into the finished masterpiece.”

So Harold rushed eagerly from 
home with his kite and March Wind 
met him and away they hurried. For 
a while they had a joyous time. Then 
something occurred. Just beneath the 
hill on which Harold and the Wind 
were at play a number of boys ap- 
peared with kites of all sizes. March 
Wind began to think what fun it 
would be to toy with all those kites at 
once. And he forgot poor Harold 
whose kite became entangled in the 
branches of an elm tree. That ended 
the joy. 

Harold marched gloomily home. 
But at the gate he found a boy hold- 
ing a kite string in one hand. 

“My kite’s gone over in your yard 
—guess it’s your yard”, said the boy. 
“If you help me get that kite out, tell

Bold 


in now, 


What do you think we have inside— 
Some catkins you could toss about? 

Or chewinks that we wish to hide, 
But which you think should be let 


out? 


Perhaps you’ve heard of March hares 
mad 
Hidden beneath my bed, 
Or green and purple kites you'd like 
To toss above one’s head. 


Kingfisher might have said, I guess, 

When you were stirring up the 
creeks, 

That I’d run off with all the cress, 

Enough to last for weeks and 
weeks. 


There’s something you are looking 
for— 
Shaking my casement glass, 
Beating the vines against my door— 
Or otherwise you’d pass.

@A Kenya election manifesto asks 
for the union of Kenya, Tanganyika, 
Uganda and Nyasaland and, in the 
future, the two Rhodesias. 

@ In Uganda the Butaka land dis-

peasants declare their land sacred and 
ursalable, but the land lords, with the 
English behind them, have distributed 
much of the land and now the Eng-

The Far Horizon 
(Continued from page 22) 


Indians speak and write English puts to 
shame the average Englishman in his 
rendering of the language of a country 
other than his own, the new constructive 
Socialist review, the “London Weekly”, 
sensibly remarks that those who have 
heard Tagore, Lord Sinha, Mr. Shastri, 
the Maharaja of Alwar and other not- 
able Indians address meetings have been 
lost in admiration of their fluency and 
correctness, the impression being en- 
hanced by the natural dignity—and some- 
times the vivacity—of the lecturers. 
“That certain queer phrases have crept 
into, and apparently remain rooted in the 
language as spoken by some Indians less 
highly trained, is hardly remarkable, and 
we need not take more notice of it than 
we do of the rather amusing spelling in 
certain Indian papers. The interesting 
fact is that we can converse with our 
visitors from India with perfect ease— 
a great help to understanding—and gen- 
erally with much enlightenment, be it 
said.” I beg leave to move that the word 
“African” be substituted for “Indian” in 
the foregoing and then to be allowed to 
hail the sentiment with cheers. 

London, England, West Africa. 


THE WHITE MAN’S BURDEN 


I suggest that the first question to be 
asked is what is the European doing in 
West Africa? and that it is best in an- 
swering the question to be frank. We 
went there, and are there today, to keep 
other Europeans out, because the coun- 


THE Crisis 


— oe eee Le oe oot Of 6 |e 





tries making up British West Africa are 
considered sufficiently valuable to justify 
the expenditure of life, money and ef- 
fort. Civilization, religion, education, 
are all secondary considerations; were 
there not a large population and vast, 
wealthy countries at stake, there would 
be neither men nor money coming from 
Europe for work in West Africa. . . . 
If, then, it be conceded that the Euro- 
pean is in West Africa for the good of 
Europe, and, let us even admit, of Africa 
and the world generally, is there any spe- 
cial virtue attached to the individual who 
goes there? The reply to this must be 
in the negative, for I do not propose to 
take into account the comparative few 
who believe they go to West Africa from 
purely idealistic motives. I say “believe” 
purposely, for there is no power on earth 
so strong as self-deception. My reason 
for asking this question is that a large 
proportion of the Europeans I met in 
West Africa appeared to be under the 
impression that they accomplished a kind 
of sacrifice in going there; even if not for 
West Africa’s good, then the act was a 
self-immolation on the altar of the Brit- 
ish Empire. 
“Service” in London West Africa. 


THE FUTURE COLOR LINE 


The African World, London, re- 
ports a South African speech: 


The place which the black races are 
to take in the future development of the 
world was the subject of an important 
lecture by Professor Edgar H. Brookes, 
of the Transvaal University College, 
which he delivered at the Workers’ Hall, 
Johannesburg, to a mixed audience of 
natives and Europeans. 

“Sheer weight of numbers demands 
that the non-white races should have a 
big say, not only in their own govern- 
ment, but in the government of the 
world”, said Professor Brookes at one 
stage of his lecture. The non-white 
races were pressing forward their claim 
to a greater share of the world’s surface, 
and the world grew smaller every day, 
and South Africa was not cut off from 
the rest of the world. “The way in 
which the world solves its color prob- 
lem,” said the Professor, “must be the 
way in which South Africa will solve 
her problem.” Professor Brookes urged 
that the natives should strive to be 
worthy of equal rights. They should de- 
serve success, even though they could not 
command it. The natives should not re- 
sort to violence, for they would assuredly 
be beaten. 

Professor Brookes said that at present 
the black man was definitely inferior to 
the white man. Despite that fact the 
white people had no right to withhold 
from the non-white races the opportunity 
to show whether they could rival them. 
If science could prove that the black 
races were permanently incapable of be- 
ing civilized, then the whites would be 
justified in treating the native races as 
subordinate peoples. There was but lit- 
tle doubt, however, that individual mem- 
bers of the black races were capable of 
beating the white man at his own work,

but whether it was true of the race as a 
whole only time would show. 

“Three out of every four of the citi- 
zens of the British Empire were In- 
dians,” said Prof. Brookes. It was not 
a white Empire, but it was an Empire 
based on white supremacy. Numerical 
superiority demanded that the non-white 
races should have a big say in their own 
government. ‘They were pressing for- 
ward this claim, which they must achieve 
by developing themselves to such a point 
that no man could possibly deny it. 

Referring to the Native Bills, Prof. 
Brookes said that one point in their favor 
was that for the first time both the white 
races of South Africa, the English and 
Dutch, had combined to say that there 
must be in Parliament representatives of 
the natives. This was a significant and 
encouraging beginning, but with good 
leaders and by developing their own re- 
sources the black races could get more. 


What to Read 


(Continued from page 20) 
natives. The issues between the whites 
and the colored and the Asiatics are 
not serious. The colored peoples are 
regarded as European and the immi- 
gration of the Asiatic has been com- 
pletely stopped since 1913 by the Im- 
migrants Regulation Act. The real 
issue is with the native. 

Current History for February asks 
“Is America an Idealistic Nation?” 
The fact is brought out that slavery 
was an economic question and not one 
of sympathy and idealism. 

In the same number Franz Boaz 
exposes “Fallacies of Racial Inferior- 
ity’. Mr. Boaz writes of the effect of 
intermarriage and racial heredity, selec- 
tion and physique, the influence of en- 
vironment and fallacious intelligence 
tests and attacks almost every “Anglo- 
Saxon” idea of racial inferiority. 

In The Living Age for February 1, 


Pedro d’Alba writes on Mexico and . 


Nicaragua. ‘The article first appeared 
in the Universal, a Mexican independ- 
ent daily and presents the present diff- 
culties of the United States, Mexico 
and Nicaragua from the . Mexican 
standpoint. Mr. D’Alba says that the 
press of the United States and the pres- 
ent rulers of Nicaragua are untruthful 
when they accuse Mexico of organizing 
military expeditions. 

Leland Hall writes in Harper’s for 
February a vivid description of the 
virulent drowsiness of the Sahara des- 
ert under the title, “Salt Comes to 
Timbuctoo”. 

Rudolph Fisher scores another suc- 
cess in his story, ‘““The Promised Land”, 
which appears in the Atlantic Monthly 
for January. It is a well-written hu- 
man interest tale of a small southern 
Negro family which, after its transplan- 
tation to Harlem and its subsequent 


financial and moral emancipation, finds: 


happiness and grief and forgetfulness.

Winter 


HE Artist who paints the land- 
A. scape of Manhattan has shown a 
divine sense of beauty this winter. 
His grey and dun fall whitened for 
Christmas and then in January reveled 
in an old-fashioned snow-+torm.. The 
wind wailed and howled; the frost 
nipped and the snow swirled into great 
curved drifts. The thaw was balmy 
and less dirty than usual and then 
again of a sudden one night all the 
world was done in glistening silver 
—trees and walks and clouds. Then 
came the rain, the dark, warm, slow 
rain with soft grey fold on fold. I 
know the golden sun of West Africa 
at Christmas time and the warm blue 
of California. But I think Manhat- 
tan in its canyons was very beautiful 
this winter. 


The Children’s Bureau 


MERICAN Negroes ought to 

support in every possible way the 
continuation and broadening of the 
Children’s Bureau in the United 
States Department of Labor at Wash- 
ington. During 1926 nearly a mil- 
lion babies and children under school 
age and one hundred eighty thousand 
expectant mothers were reached by ef- 
forts carried on in forty-three states in 
co-operation with this Bureau. The 
Maternity and Infancy Act through 
which Federal aid is given to states for 
improving the health of mothers and 
children was passed in 1921 for five 
years and a bill extending it two years 
has passed the house and is before the 
Senate. It would be a calamity if this 


bill should fail. 


Pickens’ Progress 


HE work of William Pickens dur- 

ing his short stay in Europe has 
been astonishing for its variety and in- 
fluence. Birmingham, England, was 
“delighted with William Pickens”; 
Manchester says that “he spoke well 
and answered questions better”; Bris- 
tol pronounces his visit an unqualified 
success. He carried through an extra- 
ordinary program of forty-one meet- 
ings in England during seventeen days, 
traveling 3,756 miles. In Berlin, Ger-

many, he spoke in the former House of 
Peers and was reported at length in 
the daily press; in Russia, Mr. Pickens 
talked with President Kalinin, with 
Trotsky, Srednik and others. In Bel- 
gium, he helped in the organization of 
the Congress of the League Against 
Colonial Oppression which convened in 
February. This Congress was attend- 
ed by representatives of nearly all the 
oppressed peoples and Mr. Pickens was 
put in general charge of the Negroes 
of the world. This journey by a rep- 
resentative of the N. A. A. C. P. has 
been a triumphal progress and has done 
much to make known the situation of 
American Negroes to the world. 


Lincoln, Fisk and Howard 
EGULAR readers of Tue Crisis 


could scarcely have misunder- 
stood our reference to Lincoln Univer- 
sity under “liabilities” in the annual 
“Black Man’s Balarice”. We had of 
course reference to the indictment so 
ably expressed by one of Lincoln’s 
greatest graduates in the August 
Crisis, 1926, in which reference is 
made to an editorial in the May 
Crisis. It is gratifying to know that 
the quiet persistent fight by the Lin- 


coln alumni is bringing change and 
that the new president takes his chair 
with their approval and consert. 

Fisk which we listed in the same 
sense as a “liability” in January, 1925, 
is moving forward under its new pro- 
gressive president. We learn that 
“the General Education Board, the 
Carnegie Corporation, the American 
Missionary Association, Paul Cravath 
and other friends of Fisk University 
have agreed to give $214,000 toward 
helping Fisk out of debt, meet its 
current expenses for this year, do 
a minimum of repairs to the build- 
ings and thus secure the million dol- 
lars of endowment subscribed two years 
ago. 

“This $214,000 is given conditional- 
ly on our raising $100,000 from the 
colored people of America and their 
friends.” 

Here is the time for every Fiskite 
and every forward looking black to 
give “’til it hurts”. The sincerity of 
our demand for rights and reform can 
only be proven by our willingness to 
help bear the burden of its cost. 

Happy Howard! It has no news 
these days. It is just educating youth. 


A New Civil War 


HAVE always believed that when 

the definite open split between lib- 
eral and bourbon came in the South, 
the day of real emancipation for black 
and white slaves would dawn. The 
recent speech of Edwin Mims of Van- 
derbilt University brings this inevitable 
rupture nearer. This is the way 
Mims describes the two divisions of 
the South: 

A. The South represented by 
Blease and Vardaman 
Lynching 
The Ku Klux Klan 
Ecclesiastical demagogues op- 

posing evolution, etc. 
B. The South represented by 
Glass and Underwood 
Opposition to lynching under 
“any and all circumstances” 

Repudiation of the Ku Klux 
Klan and help for “every 
race and creed”, 

This latter South is the South that 

is fighting “for economic efficiency, for

widespread intelligence, for the right 
of criticism, for freedom of thought and 
for genuine nationalism”. 

We could choose better representa- 
tives of the best South, to our mind, 
and a more definite fighting slogan, but 
for the word above we are devoutly 


thankful. 


Prizes 
HE CRISIS does not for a mo- 


ment over-estimate prize-giving as 
an encouragement to human effort. 
Such plans always have many serious 
drawbacks; they emphasize the money 
motive for writing among young per- 
sons to whom the Will to Create ought 
to be more than sufficient; they give 
rise almost inevitably to a scramble for 
place and envy of success and especially 
they encourage often an undue forcing 
of the creative process. 

On the other hand, there is no doubt 
but many young colored people are 
writing today who have been encour- 
aged to do so by the many prizes re- 
cently offered. But the good done 
them and the evident increase in the 
quantity and quality of Negro Ameri- 
can Literature is probably to be meas- 
ured not so much by the accomplish- 
ment of the prize winners, as by the 
encouragement to many who received 
no prizes. It is probably true that most 
of the world’s greatest writers never 
won a literary prize. But doubtless 
many of them were first brought to a 
realization of their ability to write by 
trying unsuccessfully at first to create 
Literature and by hearing of the suc- 
cess of others. In our distribution this 
year of over $2,000 in prizes for work 
in Literature and Art, we have espe- 
cially in mind those who are going to 
try to write even more than those who 
are going to win. 


Bishops 


NE can easily see the progress that 

the American Negro has made in 
the last ten years. Much less than a 
generation ago if prominent Negroes 
had been excluded from a Washington 
banquet it would have been deemed 
wise to say nothing concerning the in- 
cident, or even to have submitted to 
segregation. Today we have a so- 
called “National Citizens Committee 
of One Thousand for Law Enforce- 
ment and Law Observance” insulting 
four black Bishops through Carlton N. 
Sherwood by asking them not to come 
to the banquet but to attend the busi- 
ness session afterward. These Bishops 
refused to accept the insult and with- 
drew from the organization. The ac- 
tion of the organization was thorough- 
ly contemptible and its shifting of re- 
sponsibility even more so. The action 


34 


of the Bishops deserves praise in every 
particular. They did not ask to at- 
tend this banquet. They were invited. 
They did not fight, vell or make any 
disturbance. They just stayed away. 


Liberia 
E have not the full text of 


President King’s recent word~- 


concerning missions. But we would 
like to point out to those writers who 
are easily and hastily criticising this 
decision and the Firestone concession 
that a more sympathetic attitude to- 
ward Liberia and her problems would 
better accord with the facts. 

Of the great good will back of 
Christian missions and the spirit of 
sacrifice no one doubts. Education and 
sanitation in Africa and Asia owe a 
great debt to them. On the other 
hand they have much evil to answer 
for: they have helped introduce im- 
perial aggression and harmful trade 
and ‘they have interfered again and 
again with blundering ignorance into 
the delicate internal affairs of nations 
and peoples they did not understand. 
When a great rich foreign church es- 
tablishes in a small poor African land 
a missionary church and school it can 
easily come to assume toward the little 
country an attitude of mastery and dic- 
tation which is annoying and danger- 
ous. The American Church in Tur- 
key and the English Church in China 
are grave political problems in those 
countries and if Liberia believes that 
foreign missions are endangering her 
stability and advance, then instead of 
swearing at her and calling her names 
it would be wiser and more Christian 
to sit in conference with the Liberians 
and find out how Christianity could 
help and not hinder that struggling 
land. 

Again there is no warrant for the 
assumption that the new rubber in- 
dustry in Liberia is bound to spell dis- 
aster. Liberia had to have modern in- 
dustry. Without it the maintenance 
of her independence in the face of the 
Modern World was impossible. Her 
struggle with England, France and 
Germany was a struggle for adequate 
capital to support indigenous indus- 
tries. In that struggle she was cheated 
of invaluable territory and saddled with 
unjust debt, but she emerged still in- 
dependent. Liberia’s financial arrange- 
ments with Firestone are as equitable 
as any country could obtain and far 
better than anything ever offered Li- 
beria before by any other country. The 
land is leased and not sold; the power 
of the government is fully recognized ; 
the necessary loan for harbor facilities 
and other developments was secured 
in the open market and not from the 
Firestone Company; and disputes are 


to be settled not py the United States 
but by the League of Nations. 

Certain it is that a great over- 
shadowing corporation like this in a 
small country is going to wield extra- 
ordinary power; as great as that of the 
railroads and steel and oil interests in 
the United States. Liberia faces the 
same difficulty of controlling organized 
wealth as other modern lands with the 
disadvantage of being a “colored” 
country; but with the advantage of 
having two or three million colored 
voters in the United States who can, 
if they have sense enough, curb the } 
Firestone power in case it becomes 
over-aggressive. 


Aiken 

OES America thoroughly realize 
Aiken? Citizens declared by 
South Carolina courts of law to be 
either entirely innocent of crime or 
of unproven guilt have been openly © 
murdered by persons well-known to the © 
public. The authorities so far have re- © 
fused to indict or arrest these murder- — 
ers or to make any real inquiry into 
their guilt. These red-handed assassins 
walk the streets of Aiken today free, 
impudent and unafraid. And the city 
ot Aiken is advertised in the public 
press as an “attractive” winter resort! 

What shall we do? 
tion of the United States guarantees 
each state “A republican form of gov- % 
ernment”. Blease, the lynchers’ United 
States Senator, was elected by less than 
one-tenth of the qualified voters of the 
state. The lynchers and the Ku Klux 
Klan rule the city of Aiken and its 
county. 

Is it possible that we the people of © 
the United States, 120 millions strong, 
with a great army of 120,000 men and 
a navy costing $300,000,000 a year; 
with 47 million Christians in hundreds 
of thousands of churches; with million- 
aire Foundations for Uplift, Art and 
Charity; with missionaries in China, | 
India and Africa; we who in spotless ~ 
holiness refuse to recognize Russia and 
curse the Grand Turk; we who in ab- © 
solute and impeccable fairness and 
justice forgive no single foreign debtor 
a red cent if we can squeeze it from 
his bankrupt soul; this “Land of the 
Free and Home of the Brave”, that 
boasts before God its Fundamental 
Righteousness—is it possible that in 
Aiken we can do nothing, nothing, 
NOTHING?
