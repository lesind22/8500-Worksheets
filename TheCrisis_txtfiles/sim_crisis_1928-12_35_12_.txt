ESTEEM 
OF THE 
“ecm  FLOME FOLK 


Richmond, Va. 


The Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc. announced in October the 
granting of a license by the Department of Banking and Insurance of 
the State of New Jersey to the corporation, to conduct its business in 
that State. All activities of the management have been centered on 
shaping up matters so that active operations could begin early in 


November. 


But despite the singleness of purpose and without any appeal to 
the Field Staff, Policyholders and Friends in the old territory, to show 
their appreciation of the corporation and its services to our group, gave 
in October the largest Premium and Application business the corpora- 
tion has enjoyed in the past three years. This was also accomplished 
right in the midst of great political agitation. 


With such Home Indorsement, we now turn aggressively to the 
task of demonstrating to the good people of the State of New Jersey 
the value of the corporation’s Superior Policy which provides for One 
Small Premium protection against Disability and Death.

HE circus is finished and the light 

spread by the Presidential campaign 
has been chiefly flashes of darkness.— 
The Negro has been stirred to political 
consctousness as never before. And for 
the most part has not known how to 
vote. This is fine. Doubt is the 
Mother of Reason.—In the strife for 
political freedom in the United States, 
no matter who loses, we win. Even 
the shame of two great parties, 
truckling and fishing for the Negro 
vote and unable to say openly what 
they are doing secretly, is a victory for 
democracy—The German Republic 
is 10 years old. This, next to the Rus- 
sion Revolution, is the greatest result 
of the World War. —You can hang 
a Dago, but it’s mighty hard to 
strangle the Truth. This the murder- 
ers of Sacco and Vanzetti are gradual- 
ly finding out.—Now that the General 
Electric has recognized Russia, the 
United States Government may be ex- 
pected to hear its Master’s voice and 
take similar action—Silly notoriety 
pays in the United States because we 
have such large numbers of fools. A 
man with 3 legs, or a boy who steals 
a ride, or a woman who falls in the 
ocean, are famous for life. People who

THe Crisis 


A Novelty in Blue 


A Story by JULIAN ELIHU BAGLEY 


CHEMING hordes of get-rich- 

quick migrants had poured into 
the Magic City of Florida for three 
years. Now the town was crowded 
with adventurers and the cost of liv- 
ing, already advanced threefold, was 
rising as steadily as mercury in a ther- 
mometer on a sweltering July morning. 
Work was plentiful but there was an 
excessive supply of workers. Thus it 
came to the point that whenever a job 
was chalked up on the bulletin board 
of the employment bureau, men—and 
women, too, as a matter of fact,— 
leaped at it like a cage of hungry lions 
leap at a hunk of raw meat. 

But the workers were not alone in 
their gamble for a chance in this new 
El Dorado. Rich folk were playing 
the game too, and scarcely a day passed 
without seeing some one of them make 
or lose a fortune. Sometimes the trick 
was turned at the Casino, but more 
likely it happened in the exchange or 
sale of a piece of land, or a hotel, or a 
restaurant, or any and everything that 
could be leased, sold, bought or ex- 
changed. Thus it was in some such 
labyrinth of scheming as this that one 
John Ketchem got possession of the 
Lyric Theater. And in the beginning 
the new owner had made the house 
pay, but when a rival capitalist opened 
the Crispus Attucks Theater for Ne- 
groes-and the Negroes deserted the 
gallery of the Lyric for the more com- 
fortable main floor of the Attucks, 
there was a noticeable decrease in the 
Lyric’s receipts. 

“Well, let the darkies go,” John 
Ketchem had told his house manager, 
“in a month or so we'll fill that gallery 
with white folks—even if we have to 
cut down on the price of admission.” 


ELL, the month or so passed. 

And true to his promise, John 
Ketchem cut down on his price of 
admission. But the gallery vacated 
by the Negroes remained empty. 
Meantime there had been much 
talk among the white folk about 
the fine singing, the furious danc- 
ing, and the genuine comedy down at 
the new theater for the colored people. 
And how had the white folk heard all 
this? From their servants, of course. 
Listen to Roseanna: “Oh! Miss Annie, 
you jus’ oughtto been down at the 
Lyric last night! It was too wonder- 
ful for words. There was a fellow 
who danced the Buck like you never 
seen’ it danced befo’. I declare, it 
seems jus’ like his foots took a fit the 
minute he give ’em the first fling. 


December, 1928 





Then there was a man who played like 
he had to git drunk to keep from being 
scared of his wife. And there was a 
woman name’ Ma Rayford, who sung 
blues that most near set me crazy. 
I hear they are going to put on a 
special midnight Buck and Wing 
Dance and, a Blues Singing Contest 
for the white folks sometime soon. And 
if they do, you must go, Miss Annie, 
cause you'll surely have the time of 
your life.” 


But Roseanna was not the only ser- 
vant boosting the Attucks shows. Here 
and there chauffeurs dropped casual 
hints to their employers regarding the 
merits of the productions; black labor- 
ers at work chanted Ma Rayford’s 
blues till their white foremen inquired 
the source of their origin, and, once 
in a while, when some tourist innocent- 
ly inquired if “Charlie,” the bellboy, 
was going to see the girl friend that 
night, “Charlie” was almost sure to 
respond: “Yes, sir, I’m going to take 
her to the Attucks.” And it required 
no prompting on the part of the tour- 
ist to find out just how good the shows 
at the Attucks were. So when the 
midnight shows at the Negro theater 
became an actual fact white theater 
patrons were curious enough to turn 
out en masse. 


And John Ketchem was among the 
first to take advantage of the oppor- 
tunity, for he attended the premiere. 


66 ELL. I hate to admit it,” he 
confided to his house man- 
ager, “but the darkies have got us 


licked. They’re giving the folks 
what they want down there. And 
weve got to change our whole 
show. We've got to put more 
pep in our productions. Our patrons 
want something different—something 
like the daskies are giving em. And 
we've got to hurry up and give it to 
em, too. Otherwise one of these days 
we'll wake up and find ourselves play- 
ing to more empty seats.” 

Well the house manager and John 
Ketchem put their heads together and 
within a couple of weeks they had 
worked out a program which bade fair 
to catch the public’s fancy. Then 
through the daily papers and on the 
screen of the theater, the patrons were 
told about it. “A stupendous pro- 
duction of My Lady of the South,” 
so the announcement read, “for one 
week only, with an all-star white cast, 
singing and acting so much like the 
people they’re portraying that you'll 
think you’re right back on the old plan- 
tation. And in between the acts 
there'll be sketches and dances. And 
for the last night, as a special extraor- 
dinary added attraction, we'll pre- 
sent Miss Virginia Lee, a little blues 
singer, who has all the native chirpers 
beat a mile. So come along, folks, 
and hear this little lady sing. You'll 
rave over her, we know. For she’s 
the bluest warbling warbler that ever 
warbled blues.” 


II 


AME Saturday night, and the final 
performance of My Lady of the 
South. For this gala event John Ketch- 
em had filled the Lyric. But it had 
taken no little energy and scheming to 
do it. Tickets had been sold to the 
whites at cut-rates, and they had bought 
out the orchestra and balcony, while the 
Negroes, lured into coming by free 
passes to certain loquacious ones and the 
extravagant claim that Miss Virginia 
Lee “had all the native chirpers beat a 
mile,” had crowded the gallery to its 
very doors. 

It’s ten o’clock now. The curtain 
has just fallen on the last act of the 
play. The house is still dark. But 
the spotlight of attention is focused on 
A Novelty in Blue. This is flashed on 
the screen: “Miss Virginia Lee, noted 
blues singer, arrives in the Magic City 
for a-one night engagement at the 
Lyric and is met at the station by city 
officials and the owner of the 
Lyric.” Then there were the usual 
scenes: handshakes . . . poses...

Da Sanaa 


smiles . . . and of course, someone 
handed the singer a bouquet of roses. 
Then the picture flickered out. But 
there was one more caption and scene: 
“Miss Virginia Lee arrives at the stage 
door of the Lyric.” And finally: “And 
now Miss Virginia Lee herself!” 


HE orchestra in the pit struck up 

Alabama Bound. Not the new 
Alabamy Bound, but the old one which 
moans about the Mississippi River be- 
ing so deep and wide that you can’t 
see your honey babe on the other side. 
The curtain ran up and revealed the 
usual plantation scene, that is, a scene 
with a cabin, a river, a steamer and 
Negroes picking cotton in a far-away 
field. A conventional affair, the audi- 
ence thought. But a moment later 
when actual smoke began curling from 
the chimney of the cabin, and the old 
stern wheel steamer gave the illusion 
of paddling her way up the river, they 
changed their opinion. Now the or- 
chestra ceased playing. Stage lights 
were subdued. Behind the scenes a 
rich contralto rang out: 
If you smell yo’ biscuits burnin’ 
Just ooze yo’ damper down! 
*Cause yo’ sweet mamma she’s gonna 

leave this town! 

The audience roared. Presently the 
singer shambled before them and began 
to sing. She felt bad... She felt blue 
... But it wouldn’t be long . . . Train 
was waiting . . . She didn't have no 
time to lose . . . She had the Down 
Home Blues. And when she had fin- 
ished this blues song she changed her 
tempo and sang That Darktown Strut, 
accompanying the tune with an ec- 
centric dance that plunged the house 
into periodic outbursts of applause. 

“She sings and dances like a darkey,” 
someone on the lower flcor ventured. 

“IT bet she is a darkey,” another 
chimed in. 

But farther away, up in the gallery, 
the Negroes weren’t so sure about her 
identity. “Boy!” a black youngster in 
the front row was arguing, “that’s a 
zigaboo jus’ as sho’s I’m born.” 

“And I don’t mean maybe!” echoed 
the brown boy at his elbow. 

“Qh shut up that nonsense, fellows,” 
a yellow boy in the row behind them 
put in. “What ails you, anyhow? 
Don’t you know they’d shut up the 
Lyric forever an’ ever ’fo’ they'd let 
a colored girl sing here.” 

“And I don’t mean maybe!” the 
brown boy chuckled again. 

“But big boy,” the black youth came 
back strongly, “there’s: been some 


changes made ’round here since the old 


Attucks flung her doors open.. And 
besides, you can’t fool me. I know my 
people when I see ’em, ’specially if 
they’re in motion. Look at them teeth, 
will you—white as the meat of a coco- 


404 


nut! And them eyes—good Lord, 
man !—didn’t you see ’em flash? And 
wasn’t they jus’ grand! Now who 
but a joker could roll her eyes like 
that. Hey! Hey! Look a-yonder. 
Catch that step. Well if that wouldn’ 
mesmerize a ’gator, nothin’ else would. 
Boy, I’d bet my life that’s a colored 
girl ’cause ain’t nobody in the world 
could make the turns and twists that 
gal’s makin’ without being one o’ Aunt 
Hagar’s children. Look! Look! fel- 
lows—can’t you see it in her strut, fel- 
lows? Hot dog!—hey! hey! Look a- 
yonder. I mean that gal’s got Elgin 
movements in her hips with a twenty 
year ga’ntee!” the black boy concluded 
in a frenzy of delight as the singer 
finished her song and dance. 


ND once more the brown boy 

chuckled: “And I don’t mean 
maybe!” But the yellow boy was silent. 
The house shook with applause. The 
singer bowed and smiled and smiled 
and bowed. The curtain fell. But 
the audience continued shaking the 
house with applause. Then of a sud- 
den, a man on the first floor leaped 
to his feet and shouted: “Folks! do 
you know that’s a darkey gal?” 

The audience gasped. 

“Well I was jus’ a-waitin’ to see 
if anyone in the house had nerve 
enough to say that in a louder tone 
than a whisper,” a man with a long 
mustache joined in. “I know it’s a 
darkey and it’s an insult and a disgrace 
to us. We ain’t never had nothing 
like this in the Lyric before.” 


“Well what are we going to do 
about it?” a third man asked. 


“T know what I’m going to do about 
it!’ a man with red hair bellowed. 
“I’m going to take my hat and walk 
out, and all of you who call yourself 
decent’ll do likewise.” And he got 
up and made his way toward the door. 
Half a dozen men in different sections 
of the house followed his example. 
Others were shifting uneasily in their 
seats. 


“Wait a minute, gentlemen!” John 
Ketchem interrupted as he emerged 
from behind the scenes. “I can ex- 
plain everything.” 

“You can’t explain nothing!” the 
man with the red hair shouted. But 
one of the six who had so readily 
joined him came to a halt. Then the 
other five paused, too. So the man 
with the red hair wheeled around and 
snarled: “All right—explain.” 

“Ladies and gentlemen,” John 
Ketchem began. “I’m terribly sorry 
this rather unpleasant echo has crept 
into our program. But I knew it was 
coming. I heard the mumbling all 
over the house. That’s how I got on 
my guard. Now, I'll clear up the 


misunderstanding immediately. Ang

em disappeared behind the scenes, 


O NCE more the orchestra struck up 

Alabama Bound. Once more the 
brown maiden shambled onto the dim. 
lit stage. But this time instead of 
singing, she spoke. Did the people 
think she was colored? Well! that 
was the very finest possible tribute 
they could pay her for her imperson- 
ations, and she was _ overwhelmed, 
Would they like to see her take of 
her make-up, and would they like to 
see her put it on again—and sing? 
Oh, would they? Well, she would. 
And so a man darted from behind the 
scenes and helped her take off her 
brown make-up, and lo and behold, her 
face was as white as snow. Then she 
took off her black, curly wig and re. 
vealed her own hair—a mass of flowing 
gold! 

Snickering sheepishly, the man with 
the red hair shuffled back down the 
aisle and dropped into his seat. Others 
who'd started out with him did like. 
wise. The white folk laughed a* re- 
luctant laugh. The colored folk 
laughed that way, too. 

“Well I'll be damn, if that ain’t an 
ofay!” the black boy growled. And 
for the last time the brown boy added 
his inevitable ‘and I don’t mean may- 
be!” while the yellow boy harped a 
triumphant “Ah-hah! didn’t I tell you 
so! Didn’t I tell you so!” 

All this, of course, had gone on 
while Miss Virginia Lee sat at her 
make-up table. Now she rose, and 
walking toward the wings, tossed her 
black, curly wig behind the scenes. 
Then returning to the center of the 
stage, she faced her audience. Would 
the people have her sing some good old- 
fashioned song like Swanee River 
without her make-up? 

“No!” shouted the man with the 
red hair. “Tell us how you learned to 
sing blues so well. Then fix up like 
you was before and sing us some more 
songs like that first one. ‘That’s what 
we want to hear, ain’t it, folks?” 

“Yes!” responded the audience in 
one big chorus. So with her whole 
face flushing crimson, Miss Virginia 
Lee told her story. It was short and 
simple: She was reared on her fath- 
er’s plantation in Georgia, and she'd 
learned to sing blues by listening to 
the colored folk singing in the fields.

THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 


56 


A HOSPITAL'S PREJUDICE 


HAT does it matter that the 
W Sloane Maternity Hospital ex- 
cluded a previously accepted colored 
nurse from a special training course in 
obstetrics when it was found she was 
colored ? 

Of course, it was a slight and an in- 
sult to the colored nurse, Miss Gladys 
L. Catchings. And it was another of 
the slights, another of the barriers 
which Negroes as a group by their 
experience in America, have come to 
expect. 

But why did the National Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People make an issue of it in the daily 
newspapers of New York City and of 
the entire country? Why has the N. 
A. A. C. P. been writing to leading 
citizens, contributors to the fund for 
the Medical Center in New York, ask- 
ing them to protest against this action 
by the Sloane Maternity ‘Hospital au- 
thorities? What, after all, was at 
stake in the case of Gladys L. Catch- 
ings? 

To begin with, the subject of pub- 
lic health is one that cannot be divided 
by groups. It is one that concerns ev- 
ery citizen of the country. If any 
group is less well cared for medically 
and in public health administration 
than other groups in America, that 
group will adversely affect the health 
of the entire community. 

It must be remembered that there 
is a crying need for well-trained Negro 
doctors and nurses in America. The 
government reports show that there 
are only 3500 colored doctors in Amer- 
ica, or one doctor to each 3343 Negroes, 
whereas there is one white doctor to 
each 553 whites. The discrepancy is 
partly due to the length and expense 
of the training required to become a 
doctor. But it is perhaps just as much

due to the difficulties placed by race 
prejudice in the way of colored med- 
ical students. They are not wanted 
at most white institutions. If they do 
complete their course, there are only 
very few hospitals where they may 
serve as internes and complete the 
training necessary before engaging in 
private practice. 


HE same barriers and obstacles 

confront colored nurses, The case 
of Miss Catchings emphasizes the fact. 
It will be remembered that she was 
head nurse of the obstetrical division 
of the Freedmen’s Hospital in Wash- 
ington. She applied for a course in 
Sloane Maternity Hospital in New 
York, an advanced course for graduate 
nurses, in order to round out her 
training and increase her public use-

De 


fulness to her race and to the com- 
munity. She was highly recommended 
for this course, on the basis of her 
previous service and achievement by 
the head surgeon of the Freedmen’s 
Hospital. She was accepted for the 
course by the Sloane Maternity Hos- 
pital, was assigned a room, attended 
one class and then, suddenly, was in- 
formed that she could not continue. 
that she must leave—because of the 
color of her skin. 


Was this because white people ob- 
ject to the most intimate personal ser- 
vice by Negroes? Was this because 
there was anything objectionable about 
Miss Catchings personally, or any im- 
putation against her skill and com- 
petence as a trained nurse? Not at all. 
It was a plain case and a particularly 
ugly one, of white caste discrimination. 
of the determination to close an avenue 
of opportunity on grounds of the most 
bigoted form of snobbery, race hatred, 
the determination on the most un- 
American of grounds to prevent a qual- 
ified person from having opportunity 
to advance. 


What did the N. A. A. C. P. do? 
It appealed to the authorities of 
Sloane Maternity Hospital. After a 
brief correspondence these authorities 
abruptly declared the matter closed. 
The N. A. A. C. P. then wrote to the 
trustees of Columbia University, who 
had jurisdiction over the Sloane Mater- 
nity Hospital. The Secretary of Colum- 
bia University replied that control of 
the Sloane (Maernity, ‘Hospital was now 
vested in the Presbyterian Hospital, 
which has ‘for its slogan: “Without 
Regard to Race, Creed or Color”. 
Moreover, the Presbyterian Hospital 
is part of the Medical Center of New 
York, a community project on a hither- 
to unattempted scale, purporting to be

HEN the N. A. A. C. P. wrote 

to Mr. Dean Sage, President of 
the Presbyterian Hospital, whose slo- 
gan is “Without Regard to Race,

head of this institution make? He 
wrote that he concurred with the 
Sloane Hospital authorities in consid- 
ering the case “closed”, and that he 
thought, “Miss Catchings has handled 
this matter in a manner which is not 
consonant with the true interests of 


her people”. 

In __ short, 
bourbon reaction in the saddle, and 
hypocrisy to boot, made a decision 
that is unfair, and against public pol- 
icy, and then choked off further dis- 


bigoted, short-sighted, 


cussion. A further letter written to 
Mr. Dean Sage, head of the Presby- 
terian Hospital (“Without Regard to

he thought this case of discrimination 
on the basis of race and color should be 
handled, received no reply.

It may not be amiss, in this connec- 
tion to examine the statistics for infant 
mortality published this year by the 
Children’s Bureau of the United States 
Department of Labor. This tabula- 
tion shows that in states having 2000 
or more colored births each year during 
the period from 1915 to 1926, the 
number of white deaths was 70 per 
thousand as against 116 per thousand 
for Negroes. 

Now Miss Catchings is the well- 
trained colored nurse who could not 
only herself care for and instruct col- 
ored women about to become mothers, 
but who could direct and teach other 
colored nurses. There is little doubt 
that better nursing and more of it, 
among colored women, would reduce 
this disproportionately large infant 
mortality among Negroes.- Yet, the 
opportunity for this training was de- 
nied Miss Catchings by the Sloane 
Maternity Hospital, under the juris- 
diction of the Presbyterian Hospital 
“Without Regard to Race, Creed or 
Color”, both of these institutions be-

Calendar Chat 
ee cocons almost here! That’s 


what comes to our minds as we 
think of December. And we string a 
chain of pleasant memories that is like 
the popped corn bits that swing on the 
Christmas tree. We recall the holly 
wreaths, the warm bright indoors and 
the cedary smell of the Christmas tree. 
It is said that in London people who 
are not able to buy the more costly 
Christmas greens get little pots of the 
dainty heather that lasts a long while. 
Thousands of heather plants are sold 
and many hearts made happy. 
We used to sing a song: 


VER the river and through the 
snow 
To grandfather’s farm we go. 
The horse knows the way 
To carry the sleigh 
Through the white and drifting snow. 
Over the river and through the snow, 
Now grandma’s cap I spy. 
Hurrah for the fun! 
Is the pudding done? 
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie!” 


These are not the most beautiful 
verses ever written. But we loved 
them because they were so jolly and 
told of just the plain merry things that 
we knew, a horse trotting “Pat, pat 
pat!” over the tight snow, bells jing- 
ling, and there was the mention of a 
pudding and a pumpkin pie and grand- 
mother’s cap and all that. To sing 
it was like crying, “Merry Christmas, 
everybody !” 


LET HIM RUMMAGE 


ENNY was with her now, a ner- 

vous inattentive little thing, hard 
to like, seemed to her. So different 
from Reuben. Instead of saying “Yes” 
and “No, Mother Gardner” the child 
would grunt “Yap” and ‘“Umph- 
humph” and “Naw”. He seemed a 
hopeless case. 

Mother Gardner tried to teach him 
but he never listened to anything. In- 
deed at first he had had an unconscious 
habit of drumming lightly on things 
while she talked. Denny was a try- 
ing ferret-eyed little being. She had 
almost daily to remind him of house- 
hold tasks. 

And now on Christmas Eve he had 
done the unutterable—gone into Reu- 
ben’s things. They had lain for five 
years undisturbed in the little store- 
room. On leaving for a boys’ school 
in the east Reuben in his methodical 
way had gathered his handicraft  to- 
gether—the wooden swords he had

planed so neatly, the leather pencil 
cases that he had made, the stools, a 
trim airplane—all sorts of ingenious 
toys he had stacked in the little closet 
under the eaves and closed the door. 

“Grandmother,” had been his di- 
rections, “if any other boy ever comes 
to be with you, let him get in the 
closet here if he wants to and rum- 
mage.” 


UT Reuben did not know the 
value of those precious little 
things in his grandmother’s eyes. He 
was her only grandchild. And more- 
over the work was so exact and per- 
fect. And then for a careless untrained 
child like Denny to go through them 
all, move them here and there—per- 
haps lose some of the little clock 
wheels that Reuben had collected— 
this seemed too much. Denny who 
lost his cap every day and strewed his 
clothes shiftlessly about the room that 
Reuben had had! 

So on Christmas Eve night Mother 
Gardner had felt quite justified in hid- 
ing not for but from Denny the little 
gifts purchased for the next morning. 
She had told Denny there would be no 
gifts. Of course she planned for him 
te have them later on. He had whim- 
pered almost touchingly as she chided 
him, “I couldn’t help it.” 

But, there! it was Denny over and 
over again. She could never get used 
tc him. Perhaps it had been a mis- 
take to let them send her this little 
orphan from the city. He was only 
a source of anxiety to her and Sophy, 


the girl who stayed with Mother 
Gardner. + 

Preparing for bed she was gazing 
at the stars. For years she had 
watched them on Christmas Eve night 
and thought of one particular radiant 
star that lighted the path to the Mas- 
ter. How clear and beautiful the host 
of lights in the winter sky! She and 
Reuben had loved to look at them to- 
gether while she would tell that most 
wonderful story of the Wise Men and 
the Light of all the world. 

Suddenly there was a sound that 
seemed to come from Denny’s room 
though Denny had gone to bed long 
ago. Mother Gardner wondered if 
he was again disturbing Reuben’s trea- 
sures. She hurried to the child’s 
room, but found it in darkness. In 
one corner gleamed—two stars, surely, 
as light from a low window came in. 
Ir was Denny’s eyes glistening. 

“T started down to tell you again,” 
he faltered, “I’ll never meddle with 
those things any more. But I thought 
you might think I was just sayin’ it 
because it was Christmas Eve. So I 
got back in bed ’cause I thought it 
might just be better to show you than

and bits of rock into his bed room for 
use in case of robbery. The country

ARNESTNESS is a ritual 
In your essential priesthood. 
Austerity is a mantle to hide 
The laughing brown freedom 

Of your nudity. 





Black moons in a milky sky 
Your eyes droop to half-fullness 
In weary languor and bargain 
For everlasting tenderness 

In your woman. 


The softness of your voice 
Retains measured cadence 
As a net for the heart-throbs 
Of your listener. 


Love is a wandering exile 
Whose appropriate isolation 
Compensates you in artistic 
And scarcely divined 
Compromises of lust. 


Your genius finds itself 

In the narrow protrusion of thighs 
In the grimacing moonlight lost 
On a pale woman’s face. 


The procreative urge is an escape 
From provincial bars of mendacity. 
It is studied spontaniety 
Experimenting with such oddities 
As intellect and morality. . . . 


You are the blues a mad nun sings 
On Sicilian hills. 


The Gods of the Persecuted 
By HENRY LEE MOON 


‘T= persecuted make obeisance to 

many gods, 

Many unanswering gods— 

Gods who turn deaf ears 

To the prayers of the earth’s disinherited, 

Who hear not the mumbled plaints of 
voiceless pariahs 

Abased at the feet of the gods of their 
despoilers. 


Not for dumb driven diggers of ditches, 
Not for dust-choked pickers of cotton, 
Nor straining loaders of carriers, 

Not for the fettered multitudes 









zt 





That worship at their shrines 
Do the gods perform their miracles, 


Seeking balms for their sores 

The persecuted receive but the sting of 
irritants; 

Seeking contentment, but the bitterness 
of denial. 

With wounds recrudescent, 

With minds uncontent 

They turn yet 

To the gods of the privileged. 


And the gods? 

In their cloistered sanctuaries 

The worshipped stare with poker faces 
At the antics of the dust. 


The gods of the persecuted are many 
But unanswering.

Now may your anguish know an in-

Your songs have come as hands out-

And mine I send to be a further seal 

Upon the cryptic fusion of the race. 


When first they came, swift wonder 
moved beside, 

For here were words as frail and high 
as stars 

And long low echoes of a master strain 

Sounding new kinship strong as blood. 


Music is a bright Lethean stream 
Bearing old memories out to sea... 
I only knew that beauty glittered by 

In the thousand colors of delight; 


I only prayed my veins might surge 

With your primal rhythms and your 
flame 

That I might weld my dreams like 
swords, 

Gaunt and tempered as these. 


Your songs have come as hands out-

Mine the signal and the seal of clan... 

No longer do I sense the patterns of the 
flesh, 

I only hear a wailing in the wind.

THE BELGIAN CONGO 
@_ Professor H. Baudhuin of Louvain 
University, has estimated on the basis 
of stock exchange quotations, 1928, the 
value of the investments in the Belgian 
Congo as follows: mining, $50,040, 
000; railways, $191,820,000; indus- 
trial enterprise, $861,800,000; other 
enterprises, $97,300,000; state prop- 
erty, $97,300,000. Total, $1,298,260; 
000. This valuation concerns only the 
developed part of the Congo and does 
not take into account the enormous 
territory not yet being exploited. Last 
year, the Congo Companies paid in div- 
idends $2,496,000, of which $705,000 
went to the State. The Professor est! 
mates that the total cost of the Congo 


to Belgium, up to date, has been about

THE MONO-MATAPA 
HE African World quotes Leo 


Frobenius, who has just gone on 
a scientific expedition to South Africa: 


“Mono-Matapa,” said Professor Fro- 
benius, “was undoubtedly a very great 
kingdom, and from documents which 
are now in our possession it is apparent 
that its rulers wielded great power. This 
document, which is of Portuguese origin, 
and was, no doubt, prepared at the time 
of the Portuguese emigration, in the 
ffteenth and sixteenth centuries, shows 
that the religious beliefs and customs of 
the inhabitants of this place were not of 
the kind that existed in Solomon s time, 
a view which has previously been held 
by many who have carried out explora- 
tion of these parts. ; 

“I hope to find in parts of this great 
former kingdom evidence of habitation 
from which to obtain accurate informa- 
tion concerning these old institutions. It 
is possible, if we get this information— 
and Iam prepared to stay there until I 
have—we shall be able to reconstruct 
this old Empire and its architecture and 
find its relationship to the old cultures. 
The Kings and Emperors of Mono- 
Matapa used to observe very curious 
customs. The King was very powerful, 
and conducted courts of justice and sac- 
rifice in the spring and at harvest time. 
Every seventh year, however, he was 
killed by the people and a new King 
was crowned. This is a very old custom, 
which was observed on the borders of 
the Indian Ocean. 

“Such knowledge as this helps us to 
reconstruct the character and type or 
style of their civilization. It is by se- 
curing information of this character that 
we hope eventually to discover the time 
of the foundation of the kingdom of 
Mono-Matapa. The name in_ itself 
means ‘Prince of the Mine,’ for the area 
was a great mineral centre, from which 
much gold and many rubies and 
diamonds were apparently extracted long 
before man had learned to use stones and 
metals. In the desert I hope to find 
pottery which will enable us to establish 
the relationship of this old civilization 
to that in other parts of the world. 
“Another link which we hope to study 
in an effort to trace the development of 
Civilization in these parts will be accom- 
plished through the discovery of some 
pictures on stone, which portray ani- 
mals and hunting people with bows and 
arrows. These are unquestionably 
Bushmen pictures, found in many parts 
of Africa.” 

Dr. Frobenius, concluding, said that 
he had been preparing for this explora- 
tion, which was his ninth, for twenty- 

ve years, and during the long period 
ad been accumulating knowledge, which

he hoped would now yield him early 
discovery of the long-waited details of 
this former kingdom. 


EDUCATION IN AFRICA 


FORMER Governor of the Gold 
Coast who founded Achimota 
said recently in London: 


Every backward race has a civilization 
of its own. This civilization has not 
remained unchanged throughout the ages. 
Although some of them are very old, the 
institutions of tribal government and the 
general life of the people to-day are not 
exactly the same as in the beginning. 
They are what the changing needs and 
general mental development of the race 
have evolved in the course of many gen- 
erations. This is the natural, and only 
sound, method on which the African 
races should continue their evolution. 
But every year sees the African races 
come in closer touch with the advanced 
civilizatior® of the West. Every year 
the African sees, more and more, the 
benefits which he can derive from some 
of our institutions. Unless we can de- 
vise a system by which he can discrim- 
inate between those of our institutions 
which will benefit him, and those which 
will not, he will imitate without knowl- 
edge. This will certainly lead to the 
gradual destruction of African civiliza- 
tions, and the promiscuous adoption of 
institutions which the masses will not 
have had the time or the knowledge to 
digest. In some parts of Africa this 
process has begun. Although ground 
has been lost, it is not irretrievable, but 
the next few years form a psychological 
period in the mental and moral develop- 
ment of the African races. Our task is 
to give them such education as will lead 
to their acquiring the knowledge neces- 
sary to the wise selection of those of 
their own institutions to be discarded, 
retained, or blended with the institu- 
tions of Western civilization. We can- 
not do this without their help. 

We must, therefore, give them the 
opportunties for a higher education that 
will permit of the development of 
leaders, and the sound and thorough pri- 
mary education that will enable the 
masses to select and understand their 
own leaders. In adopting such a pro- 
gramme, it follows that we must credit 
the African races with the capacity to 
attain eventually the mental develop- 
ment of the European or American. 
There is no scientific proof which con- 
tradicts this belief. On the other hand, 
individual Africans have made valuable 
contributions to their respective coun- 
tries after receiving a sound Western 
education. What the individual can do, 
the race can do, provided that the educa- 
tional errors of the past are rectified. 
Summing up, it is our duty, as members 


of the Christian nations of Western 
civilization, to give the races over which 
we are ruling the opportunities which 
our own ancestors has had: and suffi- 
cient time to take advantage of them, 
before we can consign them to the limbo 
of the uneducable. 


The Gold Coast Independent, a 
Negro. paper, adds: 


It does sound rather strange and 
funny to us that in these days the opinion 
should gain widespread currency in high 
places—official and otherwise—that the 
African is not capable of evolving his 
society without suffering the loss of his 
national individuality. ‘Those who so 
share this preposterous view maintain, 
in pressing home their case, that in his 
endeavor to assimilate Western Civiliza- 
tion the African beomes denationalized, 
detribalized, or a sort of “social mon- 
ster” utterly useless both unto himself 


and his people. To show that this is a’ 


philosophical absurdity which is scien- 
tifically untenable as well as to delineate 
the lines on which he can safely adapt 
himself to Western Civilization without 
endangering and destroying his national 
identity is the sole purpose and chief 
aim of this undertaking to which these 
columns are devoted. We venture to 
say that by no stretch of the imagination 
can we reconcile ourselves with the view 
that is being so insistently put forward 
by the advocates of this queer notion, 
nor can we for a single moment con- 
ceive how it can be earnestly urged, by 
any sane man or body of men who are 
possessed of reason and commonsense, 
that the African is by nature and destiny 
doomed to remain in statu quo ante in- 
finitely, and that to him and none else 
civilization, social progress, moral eleva- 
tion and development are meaningless 
ideas which he can neither understand 
nor grasp.

An Appeal to America 


HE following historic document 

was issued in the closing weeks of 
the Presidential campaign of 1928. It 
deserves to be re-read and preserved. 


The persons whose names are signed 
beneath are alike in the fact that we all 
have Negro slaves among our ancestors. 
In other respects, we differ widely; in 
descent, in dwelling place, in age and oc- 
cupation, and, to some extent, in our 
approach to what is known as the Ne- 
gro problem. 

More especially we differ in political 
thought and allegiance: some of us are 
Republicans by inheritance and long cus- 
tom; others are Democrats, by afhliation 
and party membership; still others are 
Socialists. 

But all of us are at this moment 
united in the solemn conviction that- in 
the presidential campaign of 1928, more 
than in previous campaigns since the Civil 
War, the American Negro was treated 
in a manner which is unfair and dis- 
couraging. 

We accuse the political leaders of this 
campaign of permitting without protest, 
public and repeated assertions on the 
platform, in the press, and by word of 
mouth, that color and race constitute in 
themselves an imputation of guilt and 
crime. 

It has been said, North and South, 
East and West, and by partisans of the 
leading candidates: 

1. That Negro voters should not be 
appealed to, or thetf support welcomed 
by the odvoceaaay st causes. 

2. That colore ersons should not 
hold public office, no matter what their 
character may sent how well oy 
their work nor how compete gtly,‘they 
satisfy their constituents. P 

3. That the contact of white people 
and black people in government, in busi- 
ness, and in daily life, in common effort 
and co-operation, calls for explanation 
and apology. 

4. That the honesty and integrity of 
party organization depend on the com- 
plete removal of all Negroes from voice 
and. authority. 


5. That the appointment of a public 
official is an act which concerns only 
white citizens, and that colored citizens 
should have neither voice nor considera- 
tion in such appointments. 


These assertions, which sound bald and 
almost unbelievable when stated without 
embellishment, have appeared as full- 
paged advertisements in the public press, 
as the subject of leading editorials, and as 
displayed news stories; they have been re- 
peated on the public platform in open de- 
bate and over the radio by both Repub- 
lican and Democratic speakers, and they 
have been received by the nation and by 
the adherents of these and other parties 
in almost complete silence. A few per- 
sons have deprecated this gratuitous lug- 
ging in of the race problem, but for the 
most part, this astonishing campaign of 
public insult toward one-tenth of the na- 


416 


tion has evoked no word of protest from 
the leading party candidates or from 
their official spokesmen; and from few re- 
ligious ministers, Protestant or Catholic, 
or Jewish, and from almost no leading 
social reformer. 

Much has been said and rightly of the 
danger in a republic like ours of making 
sincere religious belief a matter of politi- 
cal controversy and of diverting public 
attention from great questions of public 
policy to petty matters of private life. 
But, Citizens of America, bad as religi- 
ous hatred and evil personal gossip are, 
they have not the seeds of evil and dis- 
aster that lie in continued, unlimited and 
unrestrained appeal to race prejudice. 
The emphasis of racial contempt and 
hatred which was made in this cam- 
paign is an appeal to the lowest and most 
primitive of human motives, and as long 
as this appeal can successfully be made, 
there is for this land no real peace, no 
sincere religion, no national unity, no 
social progress, even in matters far re- 
moved from racial controversy. 

Do not misunderstand us: we are not 
asking equality where there is no equal- 
ity. We are not demanding or even dis- 
cussing purely social intermingling. We 
have not the slightest desire for inter- 
marriage between the races. We frankly 
recognize that the aftermath of slavery 
must involve long years of poverty, crime 
and contempt; for all of this that the past 
has brought and the present gives we 
have paid in good temper, quiet work 
and unfaltering faith. But we do sol- 
emnly affirm that in a civilized land and 
in a Christian culture and among in- 
creasingly intelligent people, somewhere 
and sometime, limits must be put to race 
disparagement and separation and to 
campaigns of racial calumny which seek 
to set twelve million. human beings out- 
side the pale of ordinary humanity. 

We believe that this nation and every 
part of it must come to admit that the 
gradual disappearance of inequalities be- 
tween racial groups and the gradual 
softening of prejudice and hatred, is a 
sign of advance and not of retrogression 
and should be hailed as such by all de- 
cent folk and we think it monstrous to 
wage a political campaign in which the 
fading and softening of racial animosity 
and the increase of co-operation can be 
held up to the nation as a fault and not 
as a virtue. We do not believe that the 
majority of the white people whether 
North or South believe in the necessity 
or the truth of the assertions current in 
this campaign; but we are,astonished to 
see the number of pers@ms.who are 
whipped to silence in the presence of such 
obvious and ancient political trickery. 

You cannot set the requirements of 
political honesty and intelligence too high 
to gain our consent. We have absolutely 
no quarrel with standards of ability and 
character which will bring to public of- 
fice in America the very highest type of 
public servant. We are more troubled 
over political dishonesty among black folk 


than you are among white. We are not 
seeking political domination. But, on th 
other hand, it is too late for us to syb. 
mit to political slavery and we most 
earnestly protest against the unchallenged 
assumption that every American Negro 
is dishonest and incompetent and that 
color in itself is a crime. 

It is not so much the virulence of the 
attack in this case. It is its subtle and 
complacent character and the assenting 
silence in which it is received. Gravely 
and openly these assertions are made and 
few care, few protest, few answer. Has 
not the time come when as a nation, 
North and South, black and white, we 
can stop this tragic fooling and demand, 
not to be sure, everything that all Ne 
groes might wish, nor all that some white | 
people might prefer, but a certain balance | 
of decency and logic in the- discussion of 
race? Can we not as a nation assert 
that the Constitution is the law of the 
land and that the 13th, 14th, 15th and’ 
19th Amendments as well as the 18th are 
still valid; that it is no crime for a col- 
ored man to vote if he meets the legal 
requirements; that it is not a crime to 
appoint a colored man to office unless he 
is incompetent; and if he is incompetent, 
the crime lies in his incompetency and 
not in his color; that in this modern 
world of necessarily increasing human 
contact it is inevitable that persons of 
different race work together in private 
and public service; that this contact is 
not wrong unless the persons are unable 
to do their work properly or unless their 
helpful co-operation is proven impossi- 
ble? 

We are asking, therefore,,in this ap- 
peal, for a public repudiation of this 
campaign of racial hatred. , Silence and 
whispering in this case are worse than 
in matters of personal character and re- 
ligion. Will white America make no 
protest? Will the candidates continue 
to remain silent? Will the Church say 
nothing? Is there in truth any issue 
in this campaign, either religious toler- 
ance, liquor, water-power, tariff or farm 
relief, that touches in weight the trans- 
cendent and fundamental question of the 
open, loyal and unchallenged recognition 
of the essential humanity of twelve mil- 
lion Americans who happen to be dark- 
skinned ?

ND He said: A certain man had 
two sons. 

And the younger of them said to his 
father: “Father give me the portion of 
your property that is coming to me. 
You and brother can settle the Negro 
problem and uplift the race and con- 
tribute to the Church and the N. A. 
A.C. P. But as for me, I’m going 
to make money and spend it on Me.” 
And the father divided his savings be- 
tween the boys. 

And not many days afterward, the 
younger son gathered all together and 
took his journey to New York where 
he went into business and soon was 
making a good income; and he became 
not only comfortably clothed and well- 
fed, but he began to waste his sub- 
stance in a showy house, rich and ele- 
gant furniture, a Lincoln limousine 
with a chauffeur and a Packard run- 
about, and an expensive wife, too 
young to have any sense, and a host 
of new friends whose first business 
seemed to be to see which could out- 
spend the other. 


And when he was spending all he 
could earn on himself and his wife and 
his pleasures, and was tired out by 
hard work all day and staying up all 
night, there arose a mighty famine in 
both his body and his soul. His head 
ached; his heart was weak; his lungs 
were congested; his stomach would 
not digest his food. In fact he seemed 
to have lost his capacity to enjoy life. 
And he began to be in want of some- 
thing which he did not have and could 
not seem to get. 

_And he went and joined himself to a 
citizen next door who seemed to be 
having a wild time. This citizen led 
him around to cabarets and gambling 
houses two or three times a week, to 
feed with the swine. 

And he would fain have filled his 
belly with the husks that these white 
and black swine ate, but somehow he 
could not digest mere filth, and the 
bad liquor and bad air made him sick. 
He tried to enjoy the loud and vulgar 
harlots but he only caught filthy dis- 
eases that made him ashamed to meet 
his wife. And no man there offered

him anything else because they had 
nothing else to offer. 


ND when he came to himself, he 

said: “What is wrong with me? 
My father and my brother have not 
near the income I have. Brother has 
an old Ford and father walks. They 
live in a small town and an old-fash- 
ioned home and neither mother nor 
sister ever owned a fur coat. And yet 
somehow they seem interested in life 
and satisfied. ‘They keep well and 
strong. They apparently have enough 
and to spare of what makes Life worth 
living, while I perish with too much. 
My soul is hungry. I will arise and go 
to my father and will say unto him: 
‘Father, I have sinned against myself 
and before you. 

“*And I am no more worthy to be 
called your son. Advise me and tell 
me what’s wrong.’ ” 

And he arose and took the train 
home. But before he had opened the 
gate his father had seen him and ran 
out and gripped his hand and led him 
in. 
And the son said unto him: “Father, 
I have sinned against myself and 
against you, and I am no more worthy 
to be called your son. Let me come 
home and work for you.” 

But the father said: “O come now! 
You’re all right, Son; you’ve got good 
stuff in you. You’ve worked hard and 
built up a good business. You are 
young enough to learn. But never 
mind your troubles. You just don’t 
feel well and you need sleep. Come in! 
We've got some roast pork and cab- 
bage; come and have a good talk with 
me and mother. I'll send and have 
brother and our friends in. It’s a long 


time since you’ve been home. We're 
powerful glad to see you.” 
The neighbors dropped in. Dinner 


was ready and the father repeated: 

“For this my son was dead and he 
is alive again. He was lost and is 
found.” And they began to be merry. 

Now his elder son was in the field 
and as he came and drew nigh to the 
house he heard the laughing and talk- 
ing. 

And he called one of his friends and 


Bi

asked him what these things meant. 

And he said unto him: “Your brother 
has come home and your father has 
roasted a young pig because he has 
received him safe and sound.” 

And he was angry and did not go 
in. Therefore came his father out and 
entreated him. 


ND he answering said to his 

father : “You know how John has 
been neglecting us and going the pace. 
Too high-toned t9 visit us, too busy to 
write, too much of a spendthrift to 
give us a helping hand, and too much 
of a fool about women to be a man. 
Yet he got as much of your hard- 
earned savings as I did and hasn’t 
given back a cent. I stayed at home 
and worked on the place and you never 
threw a party for me. But as soon as 
this son has come, who squanders his 
money with harlots, you make a hell 
of a fuss!” on 


And he said unto him: “Son, you are 
ever with me and all that I have is 
yours. From me you have learned to 
live. You have listened to my experi- 
ence and have come to realize that a 
big city and a big house and a big car 
do not make happiness and that as long 
as most of our people are poor and 
ignorant, we who are better off can’t 
succeed by forgetting them and work- 
ing and spending selfishly just for our- 
selves. You and I, Son, working to- 
gether in talk and silence, have learned 
the secret of real living: you can’t en- 
joy food if you eat too much; you 
can’t work if you don’t rest; you can’t 
get drunk and be sober; and you cari’t 
chase harlots and enjoy your wife. 
Above all, you can’t work for your-_ 
self unless you work for others. All 
this, Son, which Life taught me long 
since, is yours. You have learned it. 

“But now this poor boy is beginning 
to learn. He is awakening. You have 
never been dead like your brother. 


“Don’t you see, Son, that we should 
make merry and be glad, for this yoyr 
brother was dead and is alive again, 
and was lost and is found!”

THE CAMPAIGN OF 1928 


OR the American Negro this has 

without doubt been the most hu- 
miliating presidential campaign through 
which he has passed. The agreement 
and accord of the two leading parties 
in regard to him has at last become per- 
fect and complete. 

Tentative gropings toward accord 
date back to 1876 when under the plea 
of healing the wounds of Civil War, 
the Federal Government decided to 
give up all attempt at supervising na- 
tional elections. This put the nation 
in the humiliating position of having 
almost no control over the voters who 
elect its officials. From this com- 
promise, we moved forward during a 
long period when it was the recognized 
function of the Republican Party to 
deplore disfranchisement and assert 
stoutly its intention to defend the rights 
of American Negroes in all ways. The 
Democratic Party, on the other hand, 
took a position which accepted respon- 
sibility for Negro disfranchisement and 
made it the declared enemy of Negro 
advancement. 

As time went on, the indignation of 
Republican platforms cooled to a per- 
functory declaration against the most 
outrageous of abuses, lynching, while 
the Democratic platform became silent 
because of the bid of Northern and 
Border state Democrats for Negro 
votes. The Republicans, however, 
proceeded to disfranchise Southern 
representatives in the party convention, 
and made repeated effort to transfer 
the control of the Republican Party 
in the South entirely to the hands of 
white men. The Democratic party, 
in the South by indirect and sometimes 
by positive action, aided and abetted 
these so-called Lily-White Republicans 
and threatened revolt if Northern 
Democrats treated with Negroes. 

Complete understanding came in the 
campaign of 1928. So far as possible 
Hoover overthrew every Negro politi- 
cal leader in the South, and made state- 
ments which the South interpreted as 
A promise to appoint no Negroes to of- 
fice. The Democrats, on the other 
hand, even in the North, refrained 
s¢dulously from making any bid for 
the Negro vote. 

The result of this is that the politi- 
cal strategy which thoughtful Negro 
voters have been pursuing for sixteen 
years comes to naught. Their ideal 
was political independence, which in- 
volved breaking away from customary 
subserviency to the Republicans, and 
placing their votes at the disposition 
of either party, which bade fair from 
its record and its promises to secure 
them the largest increase of citizenship 
rights. 

When, now, neither party makes any 
promises whatsoever, or any bid for 


418 


the Negro vote; when both parties 
acquiesce in attacks of 1acial bigotry 
and assertions which show their utter 
contempt and indifference to the Negro 
voter, the Negro is compelled to seek a 
new political program. 

He may as well give up immediately 
any thought of inducing either the Re- 
publicans or Democrats to favor any 
administrative action or legislation 
which will decrease the exploitation of 
Negro labor, the disfranchisement of 
Negro political power, or which will 
condemn the use of race hatred to in- 
fluence and sway the ignorant pro- 
letariat and the self-satisfied snobs of 
the nation. With unswerving determi- 
nation and careful planning, the Negro 
must prepare to throw his whole politi- 
cal influence with a Third Party. 


The Negro must ask as the price of 
his support of such a party: (1) the 
enforcement of the 13th, 14th and 15th 
Amendments, (2) Federal supervision 
of Federal elections, (3) the distribu- 
tion of political power, based on the 
number of votes actually cast, and not 
simply on the population, (4) the so- 
cialization of wealth and income, so 
as to protect the interests of the poor 
laborer against the political power of 
the rich investor. 

Two incidents in this campaign give 
hope of success for this new political 
alignment. The first is the number 
of other groups who find themselves 
politically homeless: the women, the 
liberal white South, organized Labor, 
the Pacifists, and the Farmers are all 
politically dressed up with nowhere to 
go. They cannot even get a chance 
to vote against the thing they fear and 
hate. The second note of encourage- 
ment which comes is the unity of opin- 
ion shown by the Appeal to America 
which was sent out during the cam- 
paign. Never before in the history of 
the United States have American Ne- 
gro leaders shown so great uniformity 
on matters fundamental to their civili- 
zation and advance. Starting with this 
and leaving the Valley of Humiliation 
behind us, let us climb forward to 
real and definite political power for 
twelve million Americans of Negro 
descent. 


SEGREGATION 


ERY slowly but with unexpected 

success, the fight against govern- 
mental segregation in the departments 
at Washington has reached a stage 
where a record of achievement can be 
made and a new alignment of forces 
for the future planned. 

Beginning with the administration 
of Woodrow Wilson, and recurring 
under President Harding, efforts were 
made to segregate Negro clerks in 
Washington as follows: 


. To establish separate Negro set. 
tions. 

. To segregate clerks in the same 
sections in different rooms, 

3. To give separate service in cafe. 
terias, lockers and restrooms, 

4. To curtail the appointment of 
Negro clerks. 

As a result of 15 years recurring 
opposition on the part of the National 
Office of the N. A. A. C. P. and its 
branch in Washington, with the co 
operation of other branches, and of 
other organizations, segregation has 
stopped as follows: 

1. No new segregated sections have 

been established. 

2. Segregation in rooms by race has 

practically disappeared, the few 
remaining instances being not 
easily proven cases. 
The discrimination in cafeterias, 
except in two cases, has been ab- 
solutely repudiated by the heads 
of departments over their own 
signature. 

There remains, 
things to be done: 

1. Clerks who are discriminated 

against in the future must be 
ready and willing to test the 
legality of the discrimination. 
Legal action must be taken 
against two cafeterias, one of 
which is in the Congressional 
Library, where deliberate and il- 
legal discrimination is  well- 
known. 
Effort must be made to see how 
far clerks of Negro descent are 
being kept from appointment and 
from promotion simply because 
of color. 

The N. A. A. C. P. will now ad- 

dress itself to these last two matters.

The Seal of Approval 


HE General Education Board, after a most careful investiga- 

tion, has given a Half Million Dollars towards the Endow- 
ment Fund of TALLADEGA COLLEGE, (Talladega, Ala.), 
conditioned that the College itself shall match the gift with 
another half million dollars in five years. 


This recognition and the approval of the other great Educa- 
tional Agencies, have come as a result of a quiet efficiency, 


uncompromising standards and actual results in the field of higher 
education. 


“Talladega College proved to be a great surprise to me. I was 
not prepared to find an institution with buildings and equipment 
equal to those of many of our better known Northern institutions. 
* * * Talladega College stands as one of the foremost of the 
Negro Colleges, with curricula, teaching, buildings, and equip- 
ment fairly comparable with those of the standard colleges for 
whites in all parts of the country.” — Clarence Linton, Secretary 
of Teachers College, Columbia University. 


Talladega College has a plant worth one and one-half millions 
of dollars. 


A gift towards this Endowment Fund represents a gilt-edge 
investment in Negro Welfare.

A Novelty in Blue 
(Continued from page 404) 


“And that’s the whole secret of my 
success in putting one over on you 
to-night,” she concluded abruptly. 
Ii 
ISS VIRGINIA LEE had put on 


her brown make-up again. The 
orchestra was pumping out the intro- 
duction to The Deceitful Blues. 

“Hey, there!” the man with the red 
hair interrupted again, “you ain’t go- 
ing to sing without your wig, are 
you?” 

“Oh, no!” Miss Virginia Lee 
laughed heartily. “I couldn’t very 
well do that. I couldn’t be a high- 
brown baby with golden hair, could 1?” 
And she moved toward the wings, all 
the while snapping her fingers to the 
property man for her wig. But no 
wig came. So she darted behind the 
scenes. Reappearing with bewildering 
alacrity, the singer now arrayed in 
the full regalia of the first triumph, 
plunged into The Deceitful Blues. 
She finished. The audience ripped up 
the air with applause. Again and 
again she sang. Again and again the 
house shook with applause. And when 
she could sing no more, she bowed and 
smiled and slipped into the wings. 
But the audience—some clapping 
hands, some whistling, some stamping 
the floor violently—demanded an en- 
core. So, for the last time, the little 
brown singer with one hand clutched 
over her heart and the other tugging 
nervously at the ends of a gorgeous 
red shawl which almost covered her 
face, sallied forth and gasped one of 
those naive little please-won’t-you-let- 
me-off speeches. Then running from 
the stage by way of a flight of steps 
that carried her into the audience, she 
dashed up the aisle and made her final 
exit through the front door of the 
theater. Now what became of her 
when she reached the street, the audi- 
ence never knew. Some thought she ran 
to the street stage entrance and fied 
back stage again. Other swore she 
leaped into a waiting roadster manned 
by a young colored chauffeur and sped 
away. The local newspapers, hardest 
of all to hoax, fell in line, too, and 
carried long facetious stories of the af- 
fair, one going so far as to head its 
report: “DUSKY” BLUES SINGER 
PROVES BLONDE; HALTS 
WALKOUT OF IRATE AUDI- 
ENCE. But no one ever scented the 
real denouement of the plot. For the 
secret that long after the audience went 
home that night, John Ketchem and 
the man with the red hair and all the 
others who'd threatened to walk out 
with him (save the man with the long 
mustache, and the man who'd shouted: 
“Folks, do you know that’s a darkey

gal?”) sat back stage chuckling and 
congratulating one another for the 
success of A Novelty in Blue, never 
got out. 

“Well, fellows,” John Ketchem fi- 
nally concluded, “you sure put over 
your part of the act with a bang. And 
you, Miss Virginia Lee, did the clever- 
est bit of impersonating I’ve ever seen. 
And I want to congratulate you again. 

. That audience went home baffled 
tonight. You gave ’em something to 
wonder about, argue about. And I 
bet it’ll keep ’em coming back to the 
Lyric for a long time, too. And no- 
body’ll ever know a real honest-to- 
goodness darkey actually sang those 
songs for you tonight, either—But 
say! by golly, couldn’t that gal Mag- 
nolia sing! And couldn’t she shake a 
wicked hoof!” 


N.A.A.C.P. Battle Front 
(Continued from page 406) 
N. A. A. C. P. called upon them to do 
so. 

That the exclusion of Miss Catch- 
ings should have taken place at all was 
an outrage. That no white person in 
all New York had the courage or com- 
mon decency to protest against it, is 
something in the nature of a calamity. 
It shows once again that Negroes, if 
they are to make themselves felt, if 
they are not to lose the rights they 
precariously hold, must function as a 
group. They must realize that such 
an exclusion as that of Miss Catchings, 
is not a mere individual case. It rep- 
resents the rise, in its most menacing 
and ugly form, of the slavery idea, the 
southern determination to stigmatize 
as inferior any Negro, man or woman 
regardless of ability, service and record 
of accomplishment, who desires to pur- 
sue the path of opportunity freely open 
to whites. 

The Nn... C.. E. ws at ‘yet 
through with the case of Miss Gladys 
L. Catchings and the bigots who rule 
the Sloane Maternity Hospital and the 
Presbyterian Hospital (‘Without Re- 
gard to Race, Creed or Color”). It 
will continue to agitate this case until 
all hope of redress is exhausted or un- 
til justice is done Miss Catchings and 
all Negro doctors and nurses entitled 
to opportunity to continue their educa- 
tion and increase their capacity for pub- 


lic service. H. J. $ 


SOME WHO PROTESTED 


OME colored people did vigorously 
protest at the exclusion of Miss 
Catchings from the special course in 
Sloane Maternity Hospital. Here are 
extracts from their letters, copies of 
which they sent to the N. A. A. C. P.: 
Mr. Caspar Holstein: “This act of 
discrimination against Miss Catchings 


has invoked my sense of justice and 
fair play, and as an American Negro, 
a fact which I am proud to acknowl. 
edge, and a contributor to the Presby- 
terian Hospital Fund, I am forced to 
protest in her behalf. On the portals 
of the Presbyterian Hospital is an jp. 
scription which reads: ‘Regardless of 
Race, Color or Creed’. It was the 
realization of the dire need of an jp. 
stitution founded on such a great prin. 
ciple that prompted me to contribute 
to the Fund, and it would reflect on my 
manhood, I feel, to allow a departure 
from this noble principle to go un- 
challenged.” 

Dr. T. W. Granady: “Only a few 
days ago the daily papers throughout 
the country carried articles deploring 
the fact that our country had the high- 
est death rate in that branch of work 
in which Miss Catchings wanted to 
improve herself; then surely your hon- 
orable body could not condone such ac- 
tions on the part of a subordinate de- 
partment over which you have control, 
As a Negro who gave my contribution 
to the building fund of the Medical 
Center, firmly believing in the prin- 
ciple of service to humanity without 
regard to race, creed or color, then an- 
nounced, I strongly protest against this 
action on the part of Sloane Hospital.” 

Eugene McIntosh, proprietor Har- 
lem Employment Agency: “May | 
not as a colored man and contributor 
to the Building Fund of the Medical 
Center, ask whether the treatment ac- 
corded Miss Catchings, or discrimina- 
tion on account of race, creed or color, 
represents the policy of the Hospital? 
Of the greatest importance in connec- 
tion with this matter as I see it, and 
what was stressed by the Building 
Fund Committee in soliciting contribu- 
tions, is the perpetuation in the Medi- 
cal Center, not repression, of that 
Godly spirit and principle, ‘without re- 
gard to race, creed or color’ so nobly 
advanced by the Founder of the Presby- 
terian Hospital.” 

John W. Duncan of Duncan Broth- 
ers, Funeral Home: “We feel that 
we, as donors, have a perfect right to 
call this matter to your attention and 
we further state that unless something 
is done on your part to correct this in- 
justice, you can erase our name from 
your list of future donors and we will 
do our utmost to persuade other busi- 
ness and professional men of our race 
to do likewise.”

“T haven’t been asleep attall.” 

“What are you watching for?” 
asked Mother Gardner still trying to 
hold to her resolve of keeping Denny’s 
presents till later. 

“I stay awake to look for Santa 
Claus.” 

“I said he wouldn’t come,” Mother 
Gardner declared firmly. 

“You said you wouldn’t come. But 
I've known him longer than you. 
Some said it was nobody but your 
mother and father. But I never had 
any mother and father that I know of. 
Sc it wasn’t them. But every Christ- 
mas just as regular at the orphanage I 
got something. Some said it was Santa 
Claus. Some said Well, I just 
thought I’d give Santa Claus a chance.” 

Mother Gardner turned out the 
light. The eyes were again gleaming 
in the darkness. 

“Gee!” Denny broke out with a 
surging sob. “I wish Reuben was 
here. We'd have some time!” 

“Reuben,” began Mother Gardner, 
“is about seventeen now. He——” 

“Let him rummage!” She recalled 
his hearty request. 

“In the morning, Denny, open the 
same little closet door. You'll find 
some little gifts. You may play with 
the things my grandson Reuben left 
too. Good night.” And she covered 
the little heap carefully and made a 
New Year resolve that Christmas Eve 
night. She was not going to try to 
make Reuben of Denny.

@ A new Holland-West African pas- 
senger service between Amsterdam and 
West Africa was inaugurated in No- 
vember. The “Grotius,” formerly in 
the East Indian trade, was the first 
boat on the new line and two new 
turbine-driven ships will follow. 

@ Sir Graeme Thompson, the newly 
appointed Governor of Nigeria, is dan- 


gerously ill, and is returning to Eng- 


land. 


SOUTH AFRICA 


@ Mr. M. G. Apthorp has been ap- 
pointed Chief Native Commissioner of 
Cape Colony with headquarters at 
King William’s Town. T. W. C. 
Norton has been given a similar posi- 
tion for Natal. 

@ The Rhodesian and General As- 
bestos Corporation of Rhodesia, South 
Africa, reports a profit of $1,300,000 
for the last twelve months. This com- 
pany represents white English capi- 
tal invested in Rhodesia. 

@ The Sub Nigel, a mining company 
of Johannesburg, South Africa, has a 
capital of $3,750,000, owns over 4,000 
mining claims, and made a profit for 
the year amounting to $2,600,000 for 
the year. These two companies illus- 
trate what Africa means to England 
in 1928. 

@ The Nationalist Congresses of the 
Orange Free State and the Transvaal, 
have accepted the declaration of the 
imperial Conference of 1926, with ex- 
pressions of independence and of the 
right to leave the British Empire when- 
ever they may wish. 

@ Miss Gertrude C. Thomson, an 
English expert, has joined the Fro- 
benius Expedition, to study the ruins at 
Great Zimbabwe in Southern Rho- 
desia. 

@ The Honorable Srinvasa Sastri, 
Agent General for India in South 
Africa, was not only. openly insulted 
at a public meeting at Klerksdorp by 
hoodlums, but by Pirow, a member 
of the legislature, who made a bitter 
speech against “coolies” in South 
Africa and the giving of a dinner in 
honor of this distinguished Indian. 

@ Mr. Sastri is about to leave South 
Africa and declares that in spite of 
insult and oppression “the colored peo- 
ple can not long be kept down”. 


PORTUGUESE AFRICA 


@ After five and a half years of ne- 
gotiation, the Transvaal-Mozambique 
Convention between South Africa and 
Portugal has been signed. The former 
convention in 1919 lapsed in 1923. 
The new convention curtails the num-

Customs department, who prosecuted, 
said that Clarke had been a seaman on 
the steamer City of Khios, but had de- 
serted from the vessel at Adelaide. Upon 
his arrival in Melbourne he had been 
subjected to a dictation test of 50 words 
in the German language, but had failed 
to pass. 

Speaking correct English, Clarke said: 
“TI left my ship because my life was in 
danger if I remained on board. I am 
aware of the law of the Commonwealth 
of Australia, and I know that I cannot 
stay here.” 

Pending the arrival of a ship on which 
he will be deported, Clarke was sen- 
tenced to imprisonment for six months. 

Do you get that? Imprisoned for six 
months for the crime of putting foot on 
the British Empire and yet he is a British 
subject. 


A PHILADELPHIA HOSPITAL 


HE Philadelphia Evening Bulletin 
says: 

Those estimable Philadelphians, of 
both races, who have waged the cam- 
paign for Mercy Hospital so success- 
fully as to roll up pledges of more than 
$300,000, are to be congratulated on 
achieving a result more than fifty per 
cent beyond the goal they had set for 
their effort. The funds will supply a 
nursing home, and other equipment, 
which should enable this fine institution 
to enlarge its work for the Negro popu- 
lation, and become the centre of a widely 
extended development of hospital work 
for the race. 

There are probably 175,000 of Negro 
blood in Philadelphia, and certainly in 
the Metropolitan District, there are not 
less than 250,000. Among this great 
body there are skilled mechanics of all 
kinds, lawyers, teachers and physicians, 
and a constantly growing percentage of 
men and women of culture and aspira- 
tion. It is wise counsel and wise leader- 
ship for Negroes to develop their own 
community life, their own hospitals, and 
theatres, and other social and welfare 
enterprises, just as they have success- 
fully developed and maintain their own 
churches. The greatest Negro need is 
intelligent leadership and a larger num- 
ber of trained individuals for special 
activities. Mercy Hospital is something 
to be proud of as an institution capable 
not only of great human service, but of 
ultimate large participation in the fur- 
therance of Negro progress in Phila- 
delphia.

ANNIVERSARY 


CELEBRATION 


OMETHING much bigger than the Na- 

tional Benefit itself is involved in the 30th 
Anniversary of its founding. That something 
is the economic welfare of the Race. In cele- 
brating the amazing growth of this Company 
we are celebrating the growth of Negro com- 
mercial independence and all which that growth 
means. 


It follows, then, that our 30th Anniversary is 
not our own occasion only but one in which 
every Negro can proudly share. And we invite 
you to do so, in a practical way—a way that 
will bring you permanent benefit; a way that 
may make all the difference in the world to you 
in the battle of life. ‘ 


To forever mark the occasion, we have brought 
out the new Seven Point Anniversary Policy. 


This policy contains seven features of the most 
liberal protective and investment value to you. 
So far as we know, after thirty years of experi- 
ence, these features have never before been 
combined in one policy and obtainable for one 
small premium. 


To accept this invitation, write your full name, 
date of birth, occupation and address on a pos- 
tal and mail it to us or to the nearest branch 
office.

a colored paper, answers: 


The campaign just ended for the 
Nurses’ Home in connection with Mer, 
Hospital gives the lie to certain age-old 
assertions. In the beginning, several of 
those who are supposed to know, blant. 
antly stated that white people would 
have to contribute practically all of the 
money. Well, they didn’t! Colored 
people subscribed almost dollar for dol. 
lar. And they began with a $50,009 
handicap. The facts show that colored 
people will and do support worthy in. 
stitutions. 


Most people of the dominant group 
have the idea that Negroes are paupers, 
Any race that piles up $150,000 for an 
institution that force of circumstances 
make them accept is not a lazy, shiftless 
and good-for-nothing race. 


As a matter of fact, white citizens 
should have contributed every dime of 
the money. Negroes are not primarily 
responsible for the existence of Mercy 
or Douglass Hospitals. The Philadel. 
phia General Hospital, a city owned in- 
stitution, does not train Negro nurses 


| nor Negro physicians. Even the great 
| denominational hospitals, founded as it 


were on the ideals of Jesus Christ, slam 


| their doors in the faces of appealing 
| black men and women. 


The whole 


damnable system is the creature of the 
white man’s making. He should, there- 


| fore, pay for it. But he shirks his duty 
| and makes believe that he is being phil- 
| anthropic when he is not even doing his 
| duty. 


These institutions are essential to Ne- 


| groes. They must support them. It is 
| an unfair burden that they are forced 
| to carry. And nobly do they go upward 


| with the load strapped tightly to their 
| backs. 


Speaking editorially, The Bulletin 


| states that because Negroes subscribed 
| so generously to the fund for the Mercy 


Hospital Nurses’ Home it indicates that 
they want segregated institutions. The 


| Bulletin’s conclusion is wrong, because it 
| didn’t take all the facts into considera- 
| tion. If a highwayman sticks a gun in 
| your stomach and demands your purse 


and you give it to him it certainly does 
not mean that you want him to have it. 


| When white people close the doors of 


every hospital to Negro nurses and physi- 
cians there isn’t anything left for them 


| to do but establish hospitals of their own. 


It certainly does not prove that they 
want to be segregated. If equal oppor- 
tunity were accorded Negro nurses and 


| Physicians and Negroes wanted to estab- 
| lish hospitals of their own, then the 
Bulletin’s conclusion would be correct. 
| The Tribune believes that Negroes 


should have hospitals owned and opet- 
ated by themselves just like any other 
religious, fraternal or racial group. 


| Other groups have their hospitals but 
| they are not barred from public institu- 


tions. The Catholics, Presbyterians and 


| Jews have their hospitals, but members 


of their groups are not denied the op 


| portunity of using the great public it 
| stitutions.

THE Crisis 


CRIME 


LL too often the crime of Ne- 

groes is studied and explained as 
something “racial” or due to peculiar 
historical facts. The Philadelphia 
Daily News has this remark: 

Speakers at a New York social wel- 
fare meeting attributed crime among 
Negroes to the same causes as provoke 
it among other peoples—namely, to pov- 
erty and lack of parental control of 


ildren. 
eh is correct. When Judge Lewis 


recently insulted the Negro he should 
have attacked, instead, the economic con- 
ditions under which the Negro citizens of 
this country suffer. They are miserably 
paid and as miserably housed. They are 
discriminated against almost everywhere 
in industry. They are discriminated 
against almost everywhere educationally. 

In such circumstances the wonder is 
that they are as law-abiding and pro- 
gressive as they are. Certainly, since it 
is the whites who keep the Negro in a 
subject position it does not become the 
whites to blame the colored people for 
the results. 


Postscript 
(Continued from page 418) 
Herbert Hoover and our only hope 
lies in the smashed and riven “white 
primary” of the lower South and the 
faint but heartening promise of the 
Socialist Third Party. 

Meantime, we congratulate Oscar 
DePriest, the first Negro Congressman 
from the North and the first Negro in 
Congress for a generation. He repre- 
sents a vicious political machine, but he 
cannot be nearly as bad as the white 
men who run that machine and have 
been elected to rule Chicago. More- 
over, unless Tammany, Thompson and 
Vare give us a political chance, who 
will? Not Hoover. Not Smith. 


FLORIDA 


NE of the interesting things in 

the matter of Florida relief is 
the way in which colored people have 
responded to the appeal of Mrs. 
Bethune. She sends out a list of con- 
tributions. Among them we note, first 
of all, that the Negro population of 
Jacksonville contributed $3,000 in 
cash and sixty-five boxes of clothes. 
The Negro Department of the Travel- 
ers’ Aid Society helped the Red Cross 
furnish six hundred meals and assist 
three hundred refugees to move to 
places of safety. Outside the state 
came other items of help: The Illinois 
Good-Will Association, $345; Citizens 
and Friends of Hot Springs, Virginia,

MY TRIP THROUGH EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND 
BY CAROLINE BAGLEY 


With Introduction by Bishop W. H. Heard, 
African Methodist Episcopal Church 


$3.00 


“Caroline Bagley has the distinction of being the most extensive woman traveler of the Negro race * * * 
Interesting travel material and well done.’’—Broolyn Daily Eagle. 
“MY TRIP THROUGH EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND is filled with interest and delight from the 
first line to the last line and is one of the finest books that has appeared among us and by one of us, and 
every man, woman and child should be proud of Caroline Bagley and her book. It should be in every 
library in the country. It is a valuable reference book for prospective travelers to the Holy Land, and 
it is a pleasure to recommend it to people who love good reading.’’—Feurtado, Boston Guardian. 
“MY TRIP THROUGH EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND is better than ‘just another’ of the works 
covering this area. The writer made a study of the by ways skirted by the average writer of works of 
this kind. One thus gets an insight into phases of the Holy Land and its people generally lacking 
in the discriminating studies by hardened creatures of the travelogue. The work is handsomely illustrated.’’ 
—New York American.
