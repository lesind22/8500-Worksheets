Old policyholders and the insuring public have learned that the 
Superior and Unique Policy Contract of the Society, which provides, 
for One Small Premium, protection against Sickness, Accident and 
Death, is a Bulwark against Financial as well as Physical Death. There- 
fore, the Society’s Field Force is making, each month, new records on 


Collections and New Business Production over the record of the same 
period of last year. 


This is the way they express it:

Gentlemen : 


I have been practicing medicine for twenty-three years in the city of Peters- 
burg. My practice has been extensive, covering all of the adjacent counties, and I 
have yet to hear anything other than praise for the Southern Aid Society of Va., 
Inc. 

It seems that the Society has adopted as its policy, “Service to its patrons”. I 
know of none that settles its claims more promptly. The Society is undoubtedly 
a tremendous force in the relief of distress within our group. 


Very truly yours,

A Forward Step in Fraternalism 
‘JUDGE WILLIAM C. HUESTON 


Commissioner of Education, I. B. P. O. E. of W. 


T the Grand Lodge Session 
A held in August, 1925, the Im- 

proved Benevolent and Pro- 
tective Order of Elks of the World 
adopted resolutions introduced by Lake 
City Lodge No. 182 located at Gary, 
Indiana, establishing the Department 
of Education as follows: 

“It shall be the duty of the Board 
of Education to provide Scholarships 
for deserving Negro youths in the vari- 
ous Schools of Higher and Secondary 
education, giving preference, as far as 
possible, to those who are children of 
parents who are members of this Or- 
der; it being fully understood, how- 
ever, that Scholarships may be granted 
to deserving students who are not 
members of our Order, or who have 
no relatives who are members of this 
Order, at the discretion of the Board. 

“The Board of Education shall pro- 
vide Rules and Regulations for the 
government thereof. The Grand 
Lodge, however, when in_ session 
shall have the right to revise, or abro- 
gate said rules and provide others in 
their stead or place. 

“In order to provide funds necessary 
to the granting of scholarships in this 
Article herein provided every subordi- 
nate lodge shall pay annually into the 
Educational Fund twenty (20c) cents 
for every member carried on its rolls. 
This amount shall be paid in quar- 
terly installments as provided for in 
Article XIII, Section Three, of this 
Constitution.” : 

Under the law of the Order these 
resolutions had to be sent to the more 
than six hundred lodges in existence 
at that time on or before May Ist, 
1925, so that they could be considered 
by the various Lodges to be acted on 
at the coming Session in August, 1925. 
The writer of this article has been at- 
tending Grand Sessions of the major 
Fraternities for a number of years and 
because of his experience gained in 
such attendance, had expected in this 
instance, as in all matters where a new 
tax is provided for, much opposition; 
but much to his surprise the report 
of the Committee to which said legis- 
lation was referred, recommending the 
adoption of this enactment, was unani- 
mously approved without debate, amid 
scenes of great enthusiasm. 

Thus, we had the first great depar- 
ture of Fraternities of this kind from 
the beaten path of that fictional state- 
ment that the purpose and object of 
such organizations was and is to “care 
for the sick and to bury the dead”.

ai = 51>: 


HE passage of this provision was 
a complete reversal of form even 


for this progressive Order. For at 


Boston, Massachusetts, several years 
previous to the 1925 Session, the dele- 
gates thereto had voted-down a resolu- 
tion to establish a few general scholar- 
ships, by an overwhelming majority. 
But in the interim between these two

efforts, the world had witnessed many 
changes which had undoubtedly af- 
fected the general purposes of man- 
kind and unquestionably have changed 
a great number of American Negroes 
from the laughing, fun-seeking, fro- 
licking kind to a serious-minded group 
of people, not merely waiting, but 
hunting for opportunities and methods

groes, it is he. Our Grand Exalted 
Ruler was enthusiastic in his support 
of the new Department and therefore 
the way was made easy. 

You have read above that our reso- 
lution levied upon each male member 
of our Order a tax of twenty cents 
per member per annum. This, to- 
gether with voluntary subscriptions 
given by many of our Lodges and 
Temples brought us the sum of $17,- 
608.18 to be used for Scholarships and 
expenses directly incident thereto. It 
had required some effort, of course, 
to get the department started and to 
shape it, so that, without making it 
inflexible, it would respond to a few 
standing rules. We determined to 
have as few rules as possible. In fact, 
we have not adopted any rule that our 
Board is not willing to change imme- 
diately if it becomes apparent that if 
the change is made, it will be for the 
best interests of the cause of edu- 
cation.

Department was adopted in our

in establishing the Educational De- 
partment. That rule, as above set 
out, permits the Board to grant 
Scholarships to deserving young men 
and women absolutely unconnected by 
fraternal or blood ties with our Order. 
It is interesting to note that with more 
than 1,000,000 people concerned, many 
of them uncultured, not an objection 
has been lodged with the Commis- 
sioner because of this provision. 
Another rule that we adopted for 
the first few years and which is there- 
fore not permanent, was not to grant 
scholarships to students pursuing pro- 
fessional courses or attending second- 
ary schools because the Board thought 
that for the present we could do the 
most good in assisting young students 
in the transition from high school to 
college. All the scholarships granted 
up to the writing of this article have 
been offered and given to young men 
and women who are pursuing college 
courses. Therefore today we have 
twenty-three young men and women 
attending several different colleges lo-

EORGE 
FORBES was born in Shannon, 
Mississippi, in 1864. At the age of 
14, he went West and for a while at- 


tended Wilberforce. ‘Then coming to 
New England, he entered Amherst 
College where he was graduated with 
two life-long friends, William H. 
Lewis and William T. Jackson in the 
class of 1892. He immediately went 
to Boston. From 1893 to 1903 he 
edited the Boston Courant and also in 
1896 became one of the Assistants in 
the new West End, Branch of the 
Boston Public Library. It was 
the day when Booker T. Washing- 
ton’s star was‘in ascendency. He 
made his celebrated Atlanta speech in 
1895 and in 1903, George Forbes be- 
gan to edit the Boston Guara.an wh.ch 
William Monroe Trotter founded. 
The Boston Guardian was radical, in- 
transigeant and absolutely clear. It 
opposed Mr. Washington’s doctrine 
of surrender and compromise and it 
opposed this doctrine with editorials 
that flamed and scorched and George 
Washington Forbes wrote them. 

Whatever has been accomplished 
from that day to this in beating back 
the forces of surrender and submis- 
sion and in making the American Ne- 
gro stand on both feet and demand 
full citizenship rights in America, has 
been due in’ no small degree to 
Forbes’ work on the Boston Guardian. 
Forbes was not always right; he was 
not always fair; but he was in dead 
earnest and he had a cynical, biting 
pen and a wide background of knowl- 
edge and reading. He ridiculed and 
attacked Booker T. Washington with- 
out sympathy or consideration. ‘Time 
has mellowed some of his judgments. 
We look upon Washington now as a 
necessary phenomenon—as a sort of 
stepping sideways before Almighty 
Prejudice; but with all that, the work 
of Forbes was just as necessary and 
just as inevitable. 

The very fierceness of the attack of 
the radicals of that time brought dis- 
sention within their own ranks. 
Forbes’ work on the Guardian con- 
tinued two years but gradually ceased 
after the “Boston riot” which arose 
from the attempt of Trotter and some 
of his friends to heckle Washington 
in a public speech; this ended in Trot- 
ter’s being put in jail. Forbes disap- 


proved of ‘Trotter’s methods, but 
Trotter's incarceration rallied the 
friends of free speech and radical 


Negro agitation and resulted ultimately 
in the formation of the Niagara move- 
ment in 1905. Out of that movement 
came indirectly in 1910 the N. A. A.

George W. Forbes 


C. P. Here again Trotter disagreed 
and formed his Equal Rights League. 
Thus Forbes holds an important place 
in the development of American Ne- 
groes. 


EANTIME he had become a 

clerk in the West End Branch 
of the Boston Public Library and 
dropped out of public gaze. He was 
the only colored clerk in the Library 
service and for 32 years he never 
missed a day of work on account of 
illness. It was he who arranged the 
Theodore Parker Library, the largest 
private collection in the Central Li- 
brary. 

After severing his connection with 
the Boston Guardian he continued his 
literary work; for many years he did 
a large part of the editorial work on 
the African M. E. Review; he often 
contributed to the Springfield Repub- 
lican and the Boston Transcript and 
he worked continuously on Negro his- 
tory and biography. 

He died this year and with his death 
comes a new revelation of his work 
of service. West End, Boston, when 
Forbes went into the library, was a 
Negro center. Gradually the Negroes 
moved to South End and Jews re- 
placed them. And as Forbes formerly 
served his own people so now he 
served the Jews.. The Jewish Daily 
Forward in its Boston, New York and 
Chicago editions printed an interest- 
ing tribute to Forbes written by M. 
Bender. It has been translated for 
Tue Crisis and is here reproduced. 


EWS always have cause to complain 

about their enemies. The Jewish 
enemies, Anti-Semites, are lacking in 
no place. In every city there are to 
be found one or more Anti-Semites. 
That makes Jewish life miserable. 
But we seldom hear that Jews praise 
or extend thanks to a non-Jew who 
is a friend of the Jews. There is no 
doubt that Jews always have friends 
among non-Jews, because if all non- 
Jews were Jewish enemies it would 
be impossible for Jews to live any- 
where in the world. But the fact is 
that there are Christians that are 
friends of Jews, little and seldom 
spoken of and written about. It is so, 
possibly, because friendship is a healthy 
and normal phenomenon, while hatred 
is an abnormal state. And even as 
people look around more at sick people 
than at healthy ones, so do we notice 
our enemies more than we do our 
friends. But the fact is, that seldom 
do we hear Jews telling about their 
friends, especially when this man is an 
interesting and exceptional type. 

Last week there passed away in Bos- 
ton a Negro, 63 years of age, who 
through his knowledge and intelligence 
and good human heart helped tens and 
hundreds of intelligent Jews to get on 
their feet. A great many Jewish doc- 
tors, lawyers, engineers and men of 
other professions have reached their 
success, or owe a large part of their 
success, to this Negro. Some success- 
ful Jewish graduates of Boston col- 
leges are not ashamed to admit that 
they owe their success to this Refer- 
ence Librarian. : 


HE West End was the center of 

the Jewish population of Boston, 
just as the East Side was the center 
of the Jewish population of New York 
and even though now the Jewish peo- 
ple are moving to Roxbury, Dorches- 
ter and other points, the West End is 
still the Jewish center. In the West 
End are located the offices of the Jew- 
ish newspapers, the Jewish bookstores 
and most of the Jewish meetings and 
lectures are to be found in the West 
End. In the heart of the West End 
on Cambridge Street, stands the larg- 
est branch of the Boston Public Li- 
brary, with a large number of refer- 
ence books and other books useful to 
students. The Jewish youth of the 
West End, from public school chil- 
dren to college students,- spend of 
course most of their time in the West 
End Branch. First of course the Li- 
brary is more comfortable, warmer 
and more suited for studying than the 


r51 





tenement houses. And secondly, in the 
Library they had a friend and teacher, 
who was ready at any time to give ad- 
vice, to help solve a mathematical prob- 
lem, or to assist in a Latin transla- 
tion or grammar and in many other 
difficulties that students of High 
Schools and colleges meet in their 
studies. 

This friend of theirs was the Ref- 
erence Librarian, George Washington 
Forbes, a Negro who passed away last 
week. Mr. Forbes was one of the 
first Negroes to acquire a college edu- 
cation* and was one of the most intel- 
ligent Negroes in America. . . . 

The first few years after gradua- 
tion Mr. Forbes wrote for Boston 
newspapers. He also published many 
poems. Then he obtained a position 
in the Boston Public Library and be- 
came Reference Librarian of the West 
End Branch Library where he worked 
until the very last days of his life. He 
was an authority on English and Latin 
and was familiar with all the books 
of the Library. Mr. Forbes accom- 
plished during his life a great deal for 
his race. He was for a time editor of 
the Negro newspaper The Courant 
and also of the Guardian. He was 
just about to have published a- work 
on the “History of the Black Men in 
the Life of the Republic”. His widow 
is a cultured, intelligent woman and 
a graduate of Kingston Academy of 
New York State. 


MiG of the time of his life 
George W. Forbes spent in the 
West End Branch of the Boston Public 
Library with the Jewish people. In the 


32 years that he worked in the Library © 


he never missed an evening and never 
missed a Sunday on account of illness. 
Every evening and every Sunday when 
the school children and students came 
to the Library to study their lessons, 
it became a beehive. Mr. Forbes 
used to run around from one table to 
another, then in the balcony to the 
Children’s Room, then in the large 
reading room for adults. For one he 
found a book, another he showed how 
to solve a problem in algebra or geom- 
etry. To one he gave the meaning of 
a word, to another advice and all with 
a smile, a cheerful word, or a hearty 
laugh. Many times a college or high 
‘school student had difficulties with a 
certain subject. Whom should he go 
to? Of course Mr. Forbes and Mr. 
Forbes gave him advice, assisted, en- 
couraged, so that the student that came 
into the Library with a troubled heart 
and in despair, went out encouraged, 
realizing and seeing a way to overcome 
the difficulty. Here is one example 
of Mr. Forbes’ assistance that he gave

to the Jewish students, boys and girls 
of Boston. Several months ago, a 
famous engineer of the West came to 
Boston. He is now a very successful 
bridge engineer in some states of the 
West. This Jewish engineer called 
at the West End Library expressly to 
see Mr. Forbes and he reminded him 
that 25 years ago he was a student in 
Boston and used to study his lessons 
in the West End Library. “All these 
vears that I have been an engineer in 
the West,” said the Jewish engineer, 
“I carried on my conscience the debt 
to come to Boston some day and thank 
you for the assistance which you gave 
me when I was a student. There 
were moments when I felt like leaving 
college on account of difficulties, but 
you helped me out in passing my ex- 
aminations.” Of course Mr. Forbes 
did not recognize the student of 25 
years ago. In the past 25 years, hun- 
dreds of other students passed through 
the West End Library, but he was 
proud, however, of the fact that this 
successful Jewish engineer came to 
Boston from the far West especially 
to thank him for the favors and assist- 
ance that he had given him. 

Whenever Mr. Forbes passed the 
streets of Roxbury and Dorchester, he 
used to be stopped by Jewish men who 
were brought up in the West End. 
Many Jewish doctors passing by in 
their automobiles used to stop and 
greet him and talk of many happen- 
ings of their college days. 


Especially great was his love for 
children. He used to radiate with joy 
the couple of hours he spent in the 
balcony in the Children’s Room and all 
the children loved and admired him. 
A question that a child did not dare 
ask the teacher in school, he asked 
Mr. Forbes in the Library. Mr. 
Forbes used to answer and explain 
with a smile and in a friendly way 
and not as the nervous cross teacher 
at school would. The day when the 
children came to the Library and found 
that Mr. Forbes had died they felt 
very much depressed. It did not take 
long before a delegation of the chil- 
dren came to the Librarian of the 
West End Library, Miss Fanny Gold- 
stein, and gave her a sum of money 
which the students had collected of 
their own volition to buy flowers for 


Mr. Forbes’ funeral. 


HE Librarian was very deeply 

touched by this act of the chil- 
dren and advised them not to spend 
the whole sum for flowers because it 
was too much and instead to buy with 
part of the money a gift for Mrs. 
Forbes. The flowers and the gift box 
from the children of the West End 
were such a great surprise for Mrs. 
Forbes that she said she would not 








forget it for the rest of her life. The 
fact that they had no children of their 
own may have contributed to the great 
patience and love which Mr. Forbes 
showed to the children who came to 
the Library. 

In the West End there are also a 
great many “professional tramps”, 
poor, lonesome, unemployed men that 
spend almost all day in the Library 
reading the papers, magazines and 
sometimes a book. These lonesome 
wrecked humans all. have enjoyed the 
friendship of Mr. Forbes. These too 
he used to treat like friends and his 
smile was often the only smile that 
these lonesome people would meet with 
in their daily lives. Since Mr. Forbes 
died these so called “tramps” come in 
every now and then to the Library and 
come over to the desk of the Librarian 
or other employees and express their 
regret about Mr. Forbes’ death. 

His funeral took place from his 
home in the South End on Sunday, 
March 14th. The residence was filled 
to overflowing. Even way out into 
the street, colored and white gathered 
to pay their last respects. The pall 
bearers were his white associates of 
the Boston Public Library. The West 
End Branch where Mr. Forbes spent 
three decades of his life was closed 
from 12 to 4 P. M. on the day of his 
funeral. The floral tributes numbered 
50 and they were large and beautiful. 

Since then everybody, especially the 
children of the West End, misses Mr. 
Forbes. They feel now like sheep 
without a shepherd. The joy and hap- 
piness that reigned every evening in the 
children’s room is now gone. Though 
children still come to the Library with 
their problems they no longer have 
Mr. Forbes to assist them. The Li- 
brarian too is in despair because the 
Library cannot easily find a person to 
fill Mr. Forbes’ place as Reference 
Librarian. Such a person must needs 
have so much experience, be pleasant 
and friendly with the children and be 
willing to stay in the Library every 
evening and Sunday. 


HUS it was destined that a child 

born in the South should play 
such a role in the life of a-large part 
of intelligent Jewish professional life 
and still a larger part in the lives of 
the children of the West End. No- 
body could believe that this sprightly, 
active and “peppy” man was already 
63 years of age. He was taken sick 
with pneumonia and a few days later 
his wife called up the Library and in- 
formed them of his death. His death 
is being mourned by the Negro popu- 
lation which was justly proud of him, 
but still more is he being mourned by 
the Jewish children of the West End 


of Boston.

S a pupil of history under José 
A Julian Acosta, I always 

yearned to see the cities of 
Spain and be able to recall there the 
historic and fascinating events dealing 
with black people which are chron- 
icled in her history. The pleasure 
came to me last summer. I stopped 
at Cordoba and drew inspiration early 
in the morning from a visit to the laby- 
rinth and the mystic Mezquita where 
the Spaniards built the famous cathe- 
dral. Late one afternoon I came to 
Grenada, where Sebastian Gomez, the 
“Mulato de Murillo” and Juan de 
Pareja, the slave of Valazquez, were 
born. 


I strolled through the spacious ave- 
nue of El Gran Capitan; tarried in 
the beautiful, filigree sculptured cathe- 
dral and saw the sarcophagus of Fer- 
dinand and Isabella, the patrons of 
Columbus. I walked through the 
cloisters of the University where one 
may still see the minutes attesting the 
fact that a black man, Juan Latino, 
received here, on May 4, 1546, his 
B.A. degree before the archbishop of 
Grenada, the learned men of Spain 
and the élite of the city. I saw the 
house where he wrote his famous epi- 
grammatic poems “to adorn the trium- 
phal arches erected to Don Juan of 
Austria upon his return from the bat- 
tle of Lepanto”. I saw the home of 
Leo Africanus, ‘“‘a Moor born in Gren- 
ada and brought up in Barbarie”’, and 
the home of the Negro priest who was 
seen now and then with Latino and 
the King of Spain, walking through 
the streets of Grenada. In the church 
of Santa Ana, which I visited, the 
learned Dr. Latino used to pay his 
devotions to the Eternal Father. 


I walked up the hill to the Alham- 
bra and saw in the sunshine the lega- 
cies of. that civilization, which grew 
luxuriantly like an exotic plant native, 
yet foreign, to Spain. What a happy 
chance it was to walk through these 
courts and passages to see the crene- 
lated walls and enjoy the infinite 
charm of the arabesques; to look up 
and see the cerulean canopy perfect in 
its symmetry and look down and see 
the masterly work of the Moorish ar- 
tisans and the inscriptions of the Ko- 
ran, mute with eloquence! It was 
like drinking and eating nectar and 
ambrosia. May eternal blessings rest 
on the brow of Washington Irving, 
who awakened in the hearts of the 
Spanish people a realization of this 
treasure in their hands! It was his 
work that dtove out the marauding

Gypsies and led the government to a 
sense of its duty in the preservation 
for posterity of these architectural 
jewels of Africa. I had hoped in 
Grenada, to find somewhere a picture 
of Latino and to settle the racial iden- 
tity of Leo Africanus and of the Gyp- 
sies, who, I have no doubt, had Ne- 
groid blood; but I had to leave with 
no proof. 


LL day long, the engine puffed 
and blowed as we_ passed 
through lands that had given up life 
and crumbled and over hills and val- 


leys rolling and undulating, heavy 
with olives, wheat and grapes. At 
Aranjuez, we stopped at the summer 
residence of the Kings of Spain and 
then landed in Madrid and walked 
the Gran Via. This is the show place 
of the capital of Spain, a modern thor- 
oughfare stretching itself onward and 
forward across the old, quaint, nar- 
row streets of medieval days. Bright 
and early next morning, I went down 
to the Prado in quest of the painting 
by Juan de Pareja. What a treasure 
house is this great museum! What 
beautiful paintings and how well pre- 
served and protected! Many of them 
look as fresh as though they were 
painted yesterday. The copy of the 
Mona Lisa by Da Vinci is to me more 
ravishing than the one in the Louvre. 
All the masters are here: Rubens,

one painting, “The Calling of Mat-

of miles to look upon the work 
of this colored slave who had suc- 
ceeded by courageous persistence in 
the face of every discouragement. I 
therefore turned from the main rooms 
of this paradise of color on a beauti- 
ful day of July and asked the atten- 
dant how I could get to the sections 
upstairs. “Sorry, sir,” he* answered, 
“but they are closed for repairs.” But 
I had not crossed the Atlantic Ocean 
to be refused sight of Pareja’s paint- 
ing. I asked for the Director and met 
a pleasant and suave Castillian who 
received me cordially. I told him that 
my mission to Madrid was to see a 
picture hanging on the walls of this 
museum, painted by a Negro who had 
been the slave pupil of Spain’s most 
famous painter. We chatted in the 
language of Lopez de Vega and Cal- 
deron de la Barca, then the Director 
took a bunth of antiquated keys and 
we journeyed to the upper floor where 
he opened section after section until 
we reached the famous painting. I

canvass, where fifteen persons are de- 
picted and was glad of the opportunity 
thus given me to see this work and to 
tell my people in America of this fur- 
ther claim back in the 17th century 
to a place in the republic of arts and 
letters. 


AREJA succeeded in mastering 

the details of grinding pigments 
which have preserved in such remark- 
able freshness, his master’s work, so 
that even today they look like human 
beings stepping out of the canvasses. 
Encouraged by this, Pareja took to 
drawing and improved himself by care- 
ful and painstaking observation of his 
master’s technic. Velazquez grew to 
admire his dark pupil and when the 
Duke of Olivares engaged him to 
gather canvasses in Rome for the pal- 
aces of Philip IV, he took his slave 
along and while there, he painted 
Pareja and sent the picture to the Pan- 
theon. Justi says: “The painter An- 
dreas Schmidt, at this time in Rome, 
afterwards related in Madrid that 
when it was taken with other good 
paintings, old and new, to adorn the 
cloisters of the Pantheon on the Feast 
of St. Joseph (March 19, 1650) as 
was at that time customary, it met 
with such universal approbation that 


in the unanimous opinion of the paint- 
ers of various nationalities, all else 
seemed painting, this alone truth. In 
recognition of this, Velazquez became 
a Roman Academition in the same 
year, 1650.” 

The picture prin, J in this number 
of THe Crisis is a reproduction from 
a copy of the Roman painting now 
preserved in England in the collection 
of the Earl of Carlisle. Justi, in his 
book. on “Diego Velazquez and His 
Times”, published in London in 1899, 
notes: “The half length figure of the 
meztizo stands out on the light grey 
ground traced with a broad, firm brush 
and spare impasto on the canvas.” He 
notes the flashing black eyes with an 
almost haughty gaze and the evidence 
of African blood in the frizzly hair, 
the nose and lips and the coppery 
brown shining skin. He concludes 
that this is really the portrait of 
Pareja because it agrees with his own 
likeness in ““The Calling of Matthew” ; 
but he thinks that Velazquez has ac- 
centuated the African features and 
Pareja, the European. Curtis, the 
American, in his book on Velazquez, 
naturally doubts that Pareja is a Ne- 
gro, but there is no real question but 
that he was. The Director of the 
Museum said: (Turn to page 174)

HE 18th Annual Conference of 
the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People 
promises to be an extraordinary af- 
fair. In the first place, it is being 
held in one of the mid-west border 
states in which Negro voters hold 
the balance of power and in a year 
preceding a presidential election year. 
In the second place, the N. A. 
Cc. C. P. is invading the northern 
stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan; 
is being welcomed there by the Gov- 
ernor of the State; and is enlisting 
prominent speakers from both races. 
In the third place, the Indianapolis 
Conference will witness such a recital 
of victories as has never before fallen 
to the lot of the N. A. A. C. P., in- 
cluding two cases involving funda- 
mental citizenship rights won early in 
1927 before the U. S. Supreme Court: 
the Texas White Primary Case and 
the Louisiana Segregation Case. 

Perhaps the most important develop- 
ment of the Association’s progress, 
which will be reflected in Indianapolis 
is the increasing recognition its work 
is winning among the progressive ele- 
ment of the white South. Not only 
have N. A. A. C. P. speakers been 
touring the Southern states and speak- 
ing before audiences composed of both 
races and before white colleges and 
universities, but also white leaders in 
the South have become more and more 
interested in the work of the N. A. A. 
C. P. and more willing to support the 
Association and its principles. 

One of the important speakers who 
is to address the N. A. A. C. P. in 
Indianapolis is Dr. Will Alexander of 
Atlanta, executive secretary of the 
Committee on Interracial Relations, 
whose membership is radiating 
throughout Southern states and bring- 
ing together in conference men and 
women of both races for the considera- 
tion of common problems. Dr. Alex- 
ander’s subject for his address at the 
Conference is significant. It is “The 
Changing South”. Dr. Alexander has 
himself played a conspicuous part in 
bringing about a new era in race rela- 
tions in the Southern states and has 
proved himself a courageous fighter as 
well as a resourceful leader. His ad- 
dress should be a high water mark of 
the conference as well as a significant 
event for those interested in race rela- 
tions throughout the United States. 
It will be recalled that to Dr. Alexan- 
der was recently awarded a Harmon 
Award for his work in bettering race 
relations.

tion’s program are many of them 
familiar to colored people throughout

ULBERRIES will be my 

theme. The birds and | used 
to have such splendid feasts upon the 
red mulberry in warm, swarming sum- 
mer days. And there would be in- 
sects all buzzing about the dark, sweet 
fruit up there in the cozy mulberry 
tree where we would remain till called 
down with the warning, “You'll make 
yourselves sick”, I did not mean that 
the birds would receive this message. 
It was for the fruit-stained brother 
and sister and iriends of one who 
was sharing the joy of the great hos- 
pitable tree. 

There are certain little flavored 
grasses and leaves and peculiar va- 
rieties of fruit that appeal to child- 
hood. Pawpaws, May apples and red 
mulberries belong to the list. When 
one is grown, one no longer remem- 
bers pepper grass and mulberries. Not 
that they aren’t fine morsels for young 
people; but older people lack the lei- 
sure for continuing this wholesome 
contact with nature. 

The mulberry tree in which I used 
to pass so many happy hours has long 
since been cut down. They pro- 
nounced it, if-I remember, a “nui- 
sance”, Of course the pigs and 
chickens differed from the people in 
this opinion. I have seen great healthy 
busy-looking Plymouth Rock hens 


running off to feast upon a mulberry . 


as though they had found the finest 
titbit in the world. 

Speaking of pleasant things to eat 
reminds me that we used to have gay 
Fourth of July picnics. Of course 
you have been expecting me to say 
something about the Fourth, though 
it was rather a roundabout way to 
reach it by the mulberry tree route. 
We would go from the country to the 
country. Our village was in a valley 
and knoll region. So for variety we 
went picnicing to a place of many 
cliffs and waterfalls. Indeed it is 
called Cliffton. Here we would spend 
the day with kodaks and cakes, tor- 
pedoes and wild flowers and at dusk 
go home to fire our Roman candles 
and skyrockets. 

That reminds me again. I had a 
great surprise last Fourth of July. I 
went to Dayton with two little 
nephews who were in search of fire- 
crackers. But when we “got there, 
the cupboard was bare”. They were 
going to have a sane Fourth in Day- 
ton. Fourths really can be sane and 
yet jolly. The less money shot into 
the sky the more money for tennis

The “Rain Crow” 


Sumer is icumen in, 
Lhude sing cuccu! 
Groweth sed and bloweth med, 
And springeth the wude nu— 
Sing cuccu! 
(From an Old English Song—1250) 


E has a heavy winged way of mov- 

ing, that shadowy bird which I as 
a child called a “rain crow”. He is 
really the Yellow Billed Cuckoo with 
a creamy disk on his tail feathers. 

Once we had a brown wooden clock 
with a little wooden cuckoo that would 
violently open its door and step out and 
crow each hour. And then dart back 
into the chalet and close the door. It 
was done with startling dispatch and a 
sprightliness that the real bird seems 
to lack. 

I wonder if the cuckoos of the old 
world are such lively creatures—the 
little clocks were called “Swiss”. I 
have heard it whispered that Cuckoos 
of Europe lay their eggs in other birds’ 
nests as our Cow Birds do. But the 
Cuckoos you and I know behave dif- 
ferently. The nests that they. make 
are shabby, it is true, but they’ are 
cuckoo nests for cuckoo babies. 

One warm afternoon in late July, I 
heard a “Kull, kull, kulling” and went 
out to find where the “rain crow’’ was. 
There skulked Yellow Bill in an ash 
tree. He was making the noise not 
at all to warn me that rain was ap- 
proaching, as I supposed, but because 
of the intense sultriness just before 
the showers. 

I am sure the caterpillars would be 
glad if all cuckoos were wooden and 
living in clocks. For cuckoos feast 
upon caterpillars, no matter how hid- 
eous and how much like tiny wingless 
dragons the creatures are. So Cuckoo 
helps to save the orchards: 

“Sing cuccu, nu, sing cuccu, 
Sing cuccu, sing cuccu, nu!”

HE most common method of 
presenting material in business 
courses is by lectures and text 

books. This plan has decided advan- 
tages. It is most effective for pre- 
senting basic facts, fundamental prin- 
ciples and descriptive material to large 
classes. It also makes possible the 
covering of a large amount of ground 
in the minimum of time. The lec- 
ture and text book method, however, 
if used exclusively in teaching modern 
business principles and practices has 
certain disadvantages, especially for 
advanced students. It is not the most 
effective method for stimulating in- 
dependent thinking, critical analysis of 
material and ability in handling life 
situations on the part of the student. 
His thinking is done largely for him 
by the lecturer or author of the text 
who presents the subject matter in pre- 
digested form. What is needed, there- 
fore, is some method of supplement- 
ing the text books and lectures, which 
will give the student’a thorough mas-

tery of subject matter, which will de-

and will provide opportunity for de- 
cision and action, with concrete situa- 
tions which will be faced in. actual 
business. It is highly desirable that 
cross sections of real business prob- 
lems be set before the pupils, reflecting 
accurately the sources and situations 
under which the problems arise. 

The teaching of the natural sciences 
has undergone a revolution in the past 
half century, due to the laboratory and 


its methods. Work is made far more. 
vital and not necessarily less logical 
by the more informal reasoning of* 
creative teaching.

POETRY AND DRAMA 





Dark Dreaming 
By DOROTHY KRUGER 

RROWS of rain 

Come darting through the trees, 
Piercing with pain 
The blackened nudities 
Of forest kings, , 
And thoughts like fungous things, 


Rain and a fragrance curls 
From leaves long felled by years; 
Pain, and a dream unfurls 

To scarves of chiffon fears. 


_ [can remember, hours behind me, 

Lying in the scented land, 

Rain like a lover’s kisses blindly 

Showered on my fevered hand 

And incense of burning brushwood slowly 

Winding like a saraband 

Through hours, a dream like love made 
holy 

in the templed dark woodland. 


I can recall the crystal chain 

The sun then strung around tree tops 
And on my hands the brilliants lain, 
And in my hair the sparkling drops; 
The chrysolites on a butterfly 

Dressed in a velvet black and white, 
With wings wide spread to pierce the sky, 
And dead before the virgin flight. 


The wind song changed then and the 
theme 

Slackened, until the brushwood smoke 

Spiralled a cunning castle dream 

And tore a turret in an oak. 


Drink for my thirsting heart, 
This echoed melody; 
Crescendos, then the smart 
Of ending’s threnody. 


Religion 
EDWARD DAVID CAFFEE 


Our Idol God, Race Prejudice, uprears 

Religion on the accident of Race, 

Sponsored by all who spy upon my face 

Of pigmentation with insulting sneers, 

With studied rudeness, unkind public 
jeers. 

Idolatry which these converts embrace, 

How could it serve them when Death 
comes apace, 

Awful armor and sword deafening their 
ears? 


How could their partial God retain his 
seat 

Upon the Judge’s Bench on Judgment 
Day, 

When I shall thrust my finger to his chin 

And sneer through grinding teeth, “You 
damned Old Cheat, 

How could you judge impartially, I 

pray?” 

How may his worshipers construe his 
grin?

the technique of the Drama. About

Sambo’s laugh used to ring out 
Loud and clear in the morning. 
dambo, going about his work 
Happy in the dewy dawning. 
But now Sambo has lost his laugh, 
He doesn’t guffaw any more. 
He feels a weight upon his soul 
That was not there before. 


Sambo’s folks are all sober now, 

Going to work every morning; 

In the tube, on the L, in the surface car, 

Going to work every morning. 
Why don’t the Sambos shout aloud, 
As they did on the old plantation? 
Can’t Liza sing and laugh as before 
When she cooked on the old planta- 

tion? 


Ah, Sambo’s boys and Liza’s girls 

Are facing life benighted, 

Glimpsing at things through half-closed 

doors, 

Outside of the rooms that are lighted. 
Sambo’s boys and Liza’s girls 
Struggling on, restricted. 

Sambo’s boys and Liza’s girls 
Black, therefore convicted. 


But yes, you say, Sambo does laugh, 
About his work every morning, 
Liza still sings o’er the kitchen stove, 
Baking the rolls, in the morning. 
But Sambo’s shout and Liza’s song 
Are different now, my brother. 
He shouts to-hide the hurt in his heart 
She sings, a pain to smother.

HEN I think of the hosts of little 
ones 

Who wake to a birdless dawn, 

Who know of no meadow that waits for 
them, 

No pool with its dragon flies 

All bathed with the silver of morning 
light 

Like the lights that flash on the pool, 

When I think of that trystless waking 

* today— 

So far as to meadows and meads, 

Se far as to tossing billows of wheat, 

So far as to millet tides, 

So far as to orchards and woods to seek 

To swing from the kind sweet trees— 

I fear that the dawn’s too rich for my 
share. 

I fear I have robbed some child 

Of the fragrance of dew, 

Of the birds’ first notes, 

Of the warm kind light from God— 

All sent in tints of nasturtium blooms— 

For the little red hearts of childhood.

AMES WELDON JOHNSON’S 
“God’s Trombones” (The Viking 
Press), Seven Negro Sermons in 

Verse, blazes a new path toward the 
preservation of the Negro idiom in art. 
Much has been done to show the power 
and influence of the 
preacher among Amer- 
ican Negroes, but it 
has been extremely dif- 
ficult to show his 
place in Negro art. 
Only those who have 
actually heard the 
black preacher in the 
country districts in the 
South have any idea 
of the poetry and 
power of these leaders. 
Mr. Johnson has 
translated some of this 
into poetry and by 
avoiding the almost 
inevitable distraction 
of dialect and leaving 
naked the  untram- 
meled and _ startling 
figures of speech, he 
has made these ser- 
mons stand out with a 
singularly clear effect. 
Take that first stanza 
of “The Creation”: 

“And God stepped 


out on space, 


And _ he __ looked 
around and said: 

I’m lonely— 

I'll make me a 


world!” 
Or the first two lines 
of “The Crucifixion”: 


“Jesus, my gentle 
Jesus, 
Walking in the 


dark of the Garden” 

Beyond the beauty of the poetry, the 
outstanding thing in this book is the 
illustration by Aaron Douglas. There 
are eight full page drawings, wild with 
beauty, unconventional, daringly and 
yet effectively done. There are few 
persons who can afford not to have 
this book in their library.

cupations of Negroes from 1850 to 
1920. Dr. Wesley has used the United 
States census, public documents, re- 
ports, directories, manuscripts, pamph- 
lets and newspapers as well as general 
works. He says in his introduction: 

“The purpose of this study is to pre- 
sent a survey of the development and 
transition of Negro Labor in the 
United States from the period of slav- 
ery to the period of the entrance of 
Negroes into industrial occupations in 
large numbers. This, development has 
been one of the marked features of 





American Economic History. The 
cultural life of the Negro population in 
America is being given serious study 
and the racial contributions in the 
spirituals, the work-songs and. the folk- 
lore are receiving new attention in lit- 
erature. The story of 
the economic struggle 
of the masses to rise 
from the depths has 
been so obvious to the 
student of American 
economic progress that 
serious efforts to chron- 
icle the steps in the 
advance have been 
few. The subjects of 
Slavery as an economic 
system and the Negro 
as a slave have. re- 
ceived some attention 
in historical studies, 
but the study of the 
Negro as a laborer and 
not as a slave, has 
been left to the realms 
of personal opinion, 
unsupported assertion 
and public discussion. 
This monograph. seeks 
to give a documentary 
study of -the Negro 
Labor movement from 
the historical point of 
view. It is a picture 
of group evolution and 
of group struggle. It 
is not only the study 
of a labor movement, 
but it is the story of 
economic progress and 
of the spread of indus- 
trialism among Negro- 
Americans.” 

The task thus out- 
lined has been. thor- 
oughly and competently done and is 
supplemented by an excellent bibliogra- 
phy. 

One of the most interesting chapters 
in James E. Amos’ “Theodore Roose- 
velt: Hero to his Valet”, (John Day) 
is the chapter on the Booker Washing- 
ton dinner. There have been several 
attempts to make people think that this 
invitation of Booker T. Washington to 
dinner at the White House was quite 
unpremeditated and accidental. Mr. 
Amos shows that it was not, but he 
adds to this his own characteristic point 
of view. A few years before he died 
Mr. Roosevelt asked him: 

““*Now, James, what did you think 


159 


about it?’ 

‘I think it was all a mistake,’ I said. 

“You do?’ he said, looking up rather 
surprised. ‘And what was the trouble 
with it?’ 

‘Of course,’ I replied, ‘I don’t mean 
to say that you made a mistake, Mr. 
Roosevelt. I criticize Washington for 
accepting your invitation. He knew 
the white people of the South and he 
must have known that the affair would 
bring you—a true friend of the col- 
ored race—into a lot of unfriendly 
criticism: He had plenty of time to 
think it over and he could easily have 
found an excuse not to accept the in- 
vitation.’ 

‘So that’s what you think?’ he asked. 

‘Yes,’ I answered. 

“Well, by George, I don’t agree with 
you,’ he said and that was all.” 

This shows that the master had con- 
siderably more sense than his valet; 
which is not always true. 

The book of Samuel Schmalhausen’s, 
“Humanizing Education”, (The New 
Education Publishing Company) is a 
fearless appeal for reason in modern 
education; perhaps the keynote is 
‘struck in the prelude when the author 
quotes from Bertrand Russell: “Men 
fear thought as they fear nothing else 
on earth—more than ruin, more even 
than death.” The author says: 

“The educational pyramid is aflame 
with discontent. The teacher as a liv- 
ing personality is simply ruled out of 
existence by the repressive mandate of 
officialdom. The pupil as a creative 
spark is prematurely smothered by the 
reams of red tape which an unimagina- 
tive bureaucracy orders wrapped about 


his brightly original intelligence. Who’ 


will write the modern Odyssey of stud- 
‘ents’ wanderings betwixt the jagged 
‘coasts of Scylla and Charybdis—re- 
gents’ examinations and mid-term 
tests?” 

The book is well worth a wide cir- 
culation but if we know anything about 
democracy in the United States, it will 
not get it. 

We have received “Four Negro 
Poets”, (Simon & Schuster), edited by 
Alain Locke. The pamphlet contains 
poems by Claude McKay, Jean 
‘Toomer, Countée Cullen and Langston 
Hughes.

( To those who are interested in the 
application of some of the more recent 
‘psychological discussions to the social 
background of literature, “Sex Expres- 
sion in Literature” by V. F. Calverton 
(Boni and Liveright) will have a 
strong appeal. Attitudes toward sex are 
no longer considered instinctive reac- 
tions. “Were sex attitudes purely in- 
istinctive mechanisms, they would not 
have varied with each of the changes in 
social evolution.” The most clear-cut 


160 





comparison is that drawn between the 
sex attitudes of feudalisra and feudal 
ethics, with their freedom of liberty 
and utterance, and the rigid restrictions 
of the rising bourgeoisie. These dif- 
ferent attitudes are shown to be mani- 
festations of class psychologies, each of 
which follows in the wake of social and 
economic forces existent in the particu- 
lar era under discussion. 

It is too early to pass judgment upon 
Mr. Calverton’s predictions for the 
coming era of the emancipation of the 
proletariat, when, he says, there will 
be freedom of sex expression without 
over-emphasis of sex themes. Cer- 
tainly this is the period for which we 
hope.

IN THE MAGAZINES 


The Living Age for May 15, trans- 
lates from L’Indépendance Belge, a 
Brussels liberal progressive daily, “A 
Black Man’s Protest” by Lamine Sin- 
ghor. Mr. Singhor, a Negro delegate 
from Central Africa to the Congress 
of Oppressed Nations held recently in 
Brussels, vigorously challenges the su- 
periority of Caucasians and ‘says that 
their present colonization of Africa is 
nothing more or less than the usurp- 
tion of the right of a nation to direct 
its own destinies. 

China and Russia are becoming the 
beacons of all oppressed peoples. In 
the same issue of The Living Age a 
group of Chinese labor songs is trans- 
lated from the Rote Fahne, the Berlin 
oficial communist daily. The grim 
purpose of China can be felt in these 
songs which, through translation, have 
lost something in meter and rhyme, 
but nothing in tenacity of purpose. We 
quote a stanza from the “Speed Up” 
song : 

Abolish the rich! 

Who then is a pauper? 
Abolish private wealth! 
Let all be in common! 
Be brave, be strong, 
Be red-blooded men! 
Speed up! Speed up! 

Thomas A. Dabney discusses “Class 
or Race” in the Socialist Review for 
January. Mr. Dabney outlines clearly 
the story of the rapid rise and fall of 
the racial movement led by Marcus 
Garvey and: the beginning of the 
Negro Socialist movement. ‘ 

“Bottled” from the pen of Helene 
Johnson, the budding young poetess 
from Boston, appears in the May issue 
of Vanity Fair. About a novel nucleus 
of bottled African sand on display in 
the Harlem library, she weaves an in- 
teresting theme of the Harlem Negro 
as a gorgeous native from Africa “bot- 
tled” in the restricting clothes of civil- 
ization. 





An interesting article in the Yale 
Law Journal for April presents a sur- 
vey of State statutes dealing with “In- 
termarriage with Negroes”. Restric- 
tive intermarriage bills are part of the 
law of twenty-nine states in which 
Negroes comprise from over fifty to 
less than one per cent of the entire 
population. The remaining nineteen 
states which have no such laws can not 
be commended for lack of prejudice 
because in seven of these states, Ne- 
groes form less than one per cent of 
the total population. 

Time for May 23 carries an auto- 
biographical sketch of Sally Maria 
Diggs who was auctioned off over 
sixty years ago from the pulpit of the 
Plymouth . Congregational Church, 
Brooklyn, New York, by Henry Ward 
Beecher. 


In the same issue a brief story of the 
election of President King of Liberia 
for a third term appears. 


E. Franklin Frazier discusses “The 
Pathology of Race Prejudice” in an in- 
teresting article in the Forum for June. 
He regards the white Southerner’s at- 
titude toward the Negro as a form of 
insanity. He says: “From a practi- 
cal viewpoint, insanity means social in- 
capacity. Southern white people af- 
flicted with the Negro-complex show 
themselves incapable of performing 
certain social functions. They are, 
for instance, incapable of rendering 
just decisions when white and colored 
people are involved; and their very 
claim that they ‘know’ and ‘under- 
stand’ the Negro indicates a fixed sys- 
tem of ideas respecting him, whereas 
3 sane and just appraisal of the situa- 
tion would involve the assimilation of 
new data.” 


“The New Negro” remains ever 
popular. The Churchman for April 
30 contains an entertaining interview 
with Wallace Thurman by Granville 
Hicks. Mr. Thurman, as the oracle 
of the enterprising younger generation, 
speaks with the utmost authority con- 
cerning their multitudinous achieve- 
ments and hopes and plans. 


Covarrubias presents “Dark Deni- 
zens of Harlem’s Haunts” in Vanity 
Fair for June. Habitués of up town 
New York night clubs will recognize 
instantly in these five sketches familiar 
Syncopated figures of nocturnal dis- 
sipations. Glimpses of the usual cor- 
pulent blues singer, the waiter whose 
dancing feet are no menace to his 
well-filled tray, the cynic whose chief 
interest in life is to save mad youth 
from troublous pitfalls, the “hard 
boiled” gambler. and the lithe brown 
jazz dancer, make an unusually en- 
joyable five minutes’ entertainment. 

The June issue of Current History 


is devoted to the present upheaval in 
China.

THE FAR HORIZON 





Ba 
The Colonial Congress and 
the Negro 


HE International Congress against 

Colonial Oppression and Im- 
perialism held in Brussels last February 
passed a strong set of resolutions on 
the Negro problem, from which we 
publish an abstract: 


GENERAL RESOLUTION ON THE NEGRO 
QUESTION 


For five hundred years the Negro 
Peoples of the World have been the vic- 
tims of a most terrible and ruthless op- 
pression. The institution of the slave 
trade, as a consequence of the commer- 
cial revolution and expansion of Europe 
was the beginning of a regime of terror 
and robbery that is one of the most hor- 
rible in the history of mankind. As a 
result of this traffic, Africa lost a hundred 
million of her people. Four out of every 
five of these were killed in the bloody 
business of capture and transport, the 
survivors being consigned to a most cruel 
slavery in the New World. 

The immense wealth derived from this 
gruesome trade was the foundation of 
the wealth and development of European 
merchants and states. But the develop- 
ment of the African peoples was thereby 
abruptly arrested and their civilization, 
which in many areas had reached a high 
state of advancement, was almost com- 
pletely destroyed. These peoples hence- 
forward were declared to be heathen and 
savage, an inferior race, ordained by the 
Christian God to be slaves of the super- 
ior Europeans, without any rights that 
a white man is bound to respect. And 
a bitter and hostile prejudice arose 
against the Negro race which has domi- 
nated the feeling of almost all Europeans 
towards them, causing them to be sub- 
jected to numerous unequal, degrading 
and pernicious prescriptions. 


The abolition of chattel slavery freed 
the Negro peoples only from the thrall- 
dom of being ‘legally held as personal 
property; the enslavement, exploitation 
and extermination of these peoples: con- 
tinue until the present moment. The 
process of subjugation was greatly ac- 
celerated by the mad scramble of Euro- 
pean Powers fer African territory be- 
tween 1880 and 1890. This was due to 
the desire that financial capital had to 
put its reserves into the production of 
raw material, far from those areas of 
the industries of transformation which 
had just begun to develop in Europe. 
Afterwards, for the sake of its own de- 
velopment, industrial capitalism is joined 
to financial capitalism in the colonial 
tobbery. By force and fraud the inde- 
pendent African states were subjected, 


July, 1927 


their lands and possessions almost all 
forcibly expropriated and distributed 
among European corporations and per- 
sons and their peoples driven by a most 
brutal and inhuman system to produce 
immense wealth for their oppressors. 
Virulent diseases were introduced among 
the people and devastation can be real- 
ized from the fact that despite the great 
virility and fecundity of the African 
peoples, Africa is now the least popu- 
lous of the continents of the world. 

Thus were the blessings of Christian- 
ity and civilization brought to the Afri- 
cans. So that to-day in that vast conti- 
nent of 11,500,000 square miles only two 
small states, Abyssinia and Liberia are 
accounted independent. The former is 
now menaced by the Anglo-Italian pact 
and the latter with its customs and con- 
stabulary in the hands of American offi- 
cials and a great concession granted to a 
Wall Street Corporation can no longer 
be considered free. The expropriation of 
the lands and extermination of the peo- 
ple proceeds grimly in Kenya and the 
Sudan, a suitable reward from the im- 
perialists to the Africans whom they 
sacrificed in the great World War which 
was heralded as a war “to make the 
world safe for democracy and for the 
rights of weaker peoples”. 

Similarly the Union of South Africa 
has recently enacted a Color Bar Bill 
which prohibits the native from working 
with machinery and from employment in 
the civil services, which adds new bur- 
dens to these peoples already op- 
pressed by Pass Laws, Hut Taxes and 
the like and. who are herded into 
miserable reservations and compounds 
and terribly exploited on the farms 
and in the mines. Everywhere also 
in Africa excepting a small area on the 
West Coast where the lands and cus- 
toms of the natives have been maintained 
by them, there exists a rigorous repres- 
sion of the people under the yoke of for- 
eign imperialists. The productivity of 
this area which is 8 times greater than 
that of neighboring areas of European 
owned plantations, is an irrefutable proof 
of the utterly wanton and vicious nature 
of the system of modern slavery. 


In the United States, the 12 million 
“Negroes” though guaranteed equal 
rights under the Constitution, are de- 
nied the full and equal participation in 
the life of the Nation. This oppression 
is greatest in the Southern States where 
the spirit of chattel slavery still predomi- 
nates. Segregation, disfranchisement, 
legal injustice, debt and convict slavery 
and lynching and mob violence degrade 
and crush these peoples. This vicious 
svstem of suppression operates to reduce 
this race to an inferior servile caste, ex- 
ploited and abused by-all other classes of 
society. Haiti, established by Toussaint 





De 
lOuverture and his fellow-slaves, the 
frst successful Slave revolution in history, 
is now crushed and subjugated by the ma- 
rines of that very. power which pro- 
claimed “the war for democracy”. More 
than 3,000 Haitians have been murdered 
and large numbers are enslaved for the 
building of military roads under corvée 
system. They have been despoiled of 
their lands and liberties and imprison- 
ment and torture is the lot of all who 
dare to speak for their freedom. In the 
Caribbean colonies, the Negro. peoples 
are subjected under varying forms of im- 
perialist rule. Limited franchise and 
oppressive plantation systems reduce 
these masses to a permanent condition 
of serfdom and penury. In Latin Ameri- 
ca, Negroes suffer no special suppression. 
The cordial relations resulting from the 
social and political equality in the races 
in these countries prove that there is no 
inherent antagonism between them. 

For the Republic of Haiti, Cuba, San- 
to Domingo and for the peoples of Porto 
Rico and the Virgin Islands, we must 
demand complete political and economic 
independence and the immediate with- 
drawal of all-imperialist troops. For the 
other Caribbean colonies, we must like- 
wise demand and obtain self-government. 
The Confederation of the British West 
Indies should be achieved and the Union 
of all these peoples atcomplished. 

For the emancipation of the Negro 
peoples of the World, we must wage a 
resolute. and unyielding struggle to 
achieve : 


1. Complete freedom.of the peoples of 
Africa and of African origin; 

2. Complete equality between the Ne- 
gro race and all other races; 

3. Control of the land and govern- 
ments of Africa by the Africans; 

4. Immediate abolition of all compul- 
sory labor and unjust taxation; 


5. Immediate abolition of all racial re- 
strictions, social, political and eco- 
nomic; 

6. Immediate abolition of military con- 
scription and recruiting; 

7. Freedom of movement within Africa 
and elsewhere; 


8. Freedom of speech, press and as- 
sembly ; 
9. The right of 


branches ; 


10. The right to organize trade-Unions. 
© accomplish these ends ye must 
prosecute the following measures: 


1. The organization of the economic 
and political power of the people: 
a. Unionization of Negro workers. 
b. . Organization of cooperatives. 
Organization and coordination of 
the Negro liberation movements;

.Robeson 
AUL ROBESON has come in 


lately for a good deal of widely 
separated publicity. The Y. M. C. A. 
advertising for contributions, put full- 
page advertisements in many of the 
New York papers. The advertisement, 
with the picture of Robeson, said: 

Negro Harlem is struggling, grow- 
ing, singing, hoping. Paul Robeson, 
Roiand Hayes and many other Negro 
artists and intellectuals are aiding that 
struggle, firing that hope. 

New York invited the Negroes to 
Harlem. New York business said: 
“We have to have you for this job, 
that job and the other job. Hard jobs, 
unpleasant jobs. We have to have 
these jobs done. Come up to New 
York and do them.” 

Well, they came. 

In Harlem today, two hundred thou- 
sand of your colored fellow citizens 
are doing their stout-hearted best to 
solve, sanely and honestly, their part 
of this perplexing problem of race re- 
lations—by working hard, asking little, 
striving unceasingly for education and 
self-improvement. 

Don’t they deserve your help? 


The Y. M. C. A. thinks so and 
wants to do its part, better than its too- 
limited equipment now permits. 

At the other end of the country the 
San Francisco Call and Post has a 
page editorial with a cartoon: 


If Paul Robeson ever comes to this 
town to sing, be sure to hear him. He 
is a remarkable man. You will see a 
young black fellow, with a kind, strong 
face, more than six feet tall, with the 
build of an athlete. 


Paul Robeson is of pure African 
blood, the son of a Negro preacher 
who believed in his son and stirred him 
to develop all that was in him. One 
day Paul brought home a report card 
from school with seven A marks and 
one B mark in his studies. His father 
said, “What about that B mark? If 
you can get seven A’s, you can get 
eight.” The next term Paul did get 
eight A’s. 

When he sings he stirs the pool of 
tears for you. His voice is not highly 
trained, it has no great range. He 
sings the songs of the black man’s 
heart. The picture above was sug- 
gested by the song “Sometimes I feel 


166 


like a motherless child a long, long 
ways from home.” 

That’s about all there is to that song, 
just that sentence repeated over and 
over in varied tones. There doesn’t 
need to be any more, any variation of 
that idea. A Negro singing that some- 
times he feels like a motherless child 
a long ways from home tells you the 
whole past story of his race. 


Negro Voters 


HE Wichita, Kansas, Beacon gave 

a prize of $5.00 to W. L. Hutch- 
erson for the best article from a cor- 
respondence published May 15, 1927. 
Mr. Hutcherson’s article was worth 
the prize: 


It has been strikingly pathetic to 
observe the reaction of both the re- 
ligious and secular press, to the part 
played by the Negro, in the recent 
Chicago election. But in no case, have 
the great under lying factors been 
given. Never before in the history of 
the Negro race in America, has the 
race been accorded these rights of citi- 
zenship as they had under the former 
Thompson administration. This was 
especially true in the realm of employ- 
ment. Therefore, it was but natural 
that the members of this particular 
group ‘should have supported him 
again. 

Several references have been made 
to the local situation. Mr. Bloss, run- 
ning for the city commission, received 
almost the solid support of the Negroes 
of Wichita. Several religious leaders 
of the community have approached me 


‘and made inquiry as to just why the 


voters of the race supported Mr. Bloss. 
The answer is but an analogy of the 
situation in Chicago. As superintend- 
ent of the Dold Packing Company, he 
gives employment to around one hun- 
dred Negroes. Some of these men 
worked with Mr. Bloss in Chicago. 


One of the Negro ministers was ap- 
proached and asked if he knew Mr. 
Bloss favored a “wide open town”. 
The minister replied: “I and my people 
can live longer in a ‘wet town’ with 
work, than in a ‘dry town’ without 
work.” In other words, to the Negro’s 
way of thinking, a so-called “clean”, 
“christian”, city government, that does 
not give him an opportunity to earn 
his living in the sweat of his face, 
is not for him, good government. In a 
word, the struggle of the Negro to 
make an honest living and to co-op- 
erate with those forces that will assist 
him, should not be interpreted to mean 
that the Negro is not for good gov- 
ernment. In neither Wichita nor 
Chicago, should the Negro be forced 
to take a stand that places him out 
of harmonv with those who supposedly 
represent Good Government. 





WAR 
ESLIE P. HILL of Cheyney has 
sent out a statement concerning 
tne attitude of Negroes toward war 
which we take the liberty to quote: 


The whole world must consider the 
question whether the civilization of the 
future is to be a civilization of peace or 
of war. All the great nations are either 
vigorously engaged in preparation for 
war, or are in serious councils discussing 
the possibilities of armament. Nowhere 
do the statesmen now in charge of world 
affairs seem to be able, by arbitration or 
any other rational method, to compose the 
differences that spring up between na- 
tions. The invitation extended recently 
by the President of the United States to 
the great powers for a new conference 
on armament, has been unavailing. The 
League of Nations, in spite of the great 
ideal before it, is practically helpless. 
There is a terrible war raging in China 
and there is fertile soil full of the potent 
seeds of war in Haiti, Nicaragua, Mexi- 
co, the Philippines, Japan and Africa, not 
to mention the possibilities in Europe. 

Now war is the sum total of human 
iniquities. It is mass murder by govern- 
mental order. War is the complete vio- 
lation and defiance of everything good in 
human nature. It can be countenanced 
neither by religion, nor education, nor 
ethics, nor morality. It is revolting 
to the human conscience everywhere. 
Neither capital nor labor can profit by 
war ultimately. No helpful interracial 
understanding can be reached by war. 
No broad and lasting cooperation be- 
tween nations can be served by war. 
Nothing good for the future of mankind 
can be gained through war excepting an 
universal abhorrence of it. 

In these circumstances it is the part 
of those who are seriously concerned 
about the welfare and progress of our 
own land, and of all the nations of the 
earth, to consider what help can be 
brought to the councils of the statesmen 
to wean them off from armed conflict. 
They must consider now while our own 
nation is at peace, whether there is 
enough strength in any race or nation, 
to stand in time of war absolutely op- 
posed, in conscience and in conduct, to 
this colossal iniquity. Such a race the 
Negro ought to be in America, not only 
because the Negro has more to lose than 
he has incidentally to gain by war, but 
more fundamentally because the war 
spirit is contrary to what appears to be 
the genius of the Negro for peaceful 
progress. He has been a singing and a 
praying man. He has mainfested good 
cheer and a friendly humanity through 
centuries of persecution and disaster. He 
has extended the hand of help even to 
his oppressors. However these traits 
may be interpreted or evaluated, they 
have not only explained largely the sur- 
vival of the race in this land, but they 
have entered powerfully into such har- 
mony between the races as now exists. 
This spirit of peace and good will mani- 
fested by the American Negro is at least 
a precious human quality of the highest 
value. 


Tue Crisis 





COFFEEVILLE, KANSAS 

WO white high school girls in a 

Kansas city of 20,000 inhabitants 
claim to have been raped by Negroes 
on March 17. Blood hounds are 
brought. They lead to the Negro 
quarter and three Negroes are arrested. 
Two of them are discharged but the 
other is held. On March 18 a mob 
of 2,000 attack the City Hall in order 
to lynch this black man. The mob 
damages the City Hall, loots stores 
and chases Negroes. Twenty or more 
Negroes arm themselves and gather 
in a pool room. Two of their lead- 
ers, Anderson and Ford, shoot into 
the mob and check it, although them- 
selves desperately wounded. They 
are now under arrest and on trial for 
“inciting to riot”. Finally, the Na- 
tional Guard of the state is called out 
to guard the frenzied town. Eighteen 
white persons are arrested for rioting 
but all are discharged except one. 

Meantime, the colored man arrested 
is released when the girls declare he 
was not guilty. Then the city awakes 
from its orgy. Colored people offer 
rewards aggregating $423 to find the 
rapists. Afterward, the white officials 
ofter $2,200 in rewards. Forty-five 
thousand dollars in damage suits are 
filed against the city and others are 
still to come. . 

Then the truth begins to leak out. 
The white people try to hush the mat- 
ter up but the Negroes petition for 
a Grand Jury. The Coffeeville Daily 
Journal acknowledges, May 30, that 
white men and not Negroes were the 
bedfellows of the two girls and one 
white man is today in jail charged 
with rape while one of the girls is also 
in jail as accessory. What comment is 
adequate ? 


MRS. WILLIAMS AND BOSTON 
HELMA E. WILLIAMS was 


born in Arkansas and was edu- 
cated at the Kansas State Teachers 
College. She had taught school in 
Arkansas ahd is now Head of the Do- 
mestic Science Department of the 
Howard High School, Wilmington, 
Delaware. Recently she made appli- 
cation to study advanced cookery dur- 
ing the summer in Boston, Massa- 
chusetts. She received in reply this 
extraordinary letter: 


July, 1927 





Fotacnife 


Mee 





My dear Miss Williams: 

We have received your application for 
registration with the class which is to 
take our course in Advanced Cookery 


during the month of July. We hope 
that it will be possible for you to be 
with us this summer. 
. We have found that it is not possible 
for us to accept as students in our regu- 
lar classes people of the Negro race. 
Even the fact that you are a college 
graduate does not make it possible for 
us to break away from our regulations, 
unless we find after the class is com- 
pletely assembled that each member of 
the group finds it perfectly agreeable to 
accept a student of the Negro race. 
We frequently have special students 
who are colored and we can give you 
during July practically the same work 
which you would get if you were a mem- 
ber of the Advanced Cookery Course. 
The charge is a little higher, or we can 
give you for the cost of the Advanced 
Cookery Course private lessons to that 
amount but lasting a little less time. than 
the full four weeks. 


We will be very glad to make ar- 
rangements with you for the special work 
in July and there. is a possibility. that 
when the class is assembled we may find 
them all perfectly willing to have you join 
them for the regular class work. That 
depends entirely upon the personnel of 
the class and we cannot tell about it un- 
til the group is gathered and the class 
begins. Sometimes we find that the class 
is perfectly willing to have a colored stu- 
dent as'a member ofthe class. provided 
the dinner is eaten in different rooms. 
This is the situation at this school. Our 
teachers will be very happy to give you 
our special instructions. in advanced 
cookery and you will, I am sure, be 
pleased with the special work which we 
do here in cooking. 





DuPorb 


As we have to make special arrange- 
ments in regard to the number of in- 
structors which we have on duty during 
July when there are colored students for 
the summer course, will you be so kind 
as to let us know as soon as you can 
conveniently do so if you wish to be with 
us under the conditions as they are in 
Boston. 


Very truly yours, 
MCB/PT 
(Signed) Maser C. Braptey. 


P. S. (Handwritten) We have a 
colored student who is here for three 
or four weeks special work this month. 
Could you come immediately and join 
her? The cost would be a little less. 
We can accept you at once if you can 
come now. Please wire at our expense, 


if you want to start Monday, May 
16th. 


BRAZIL 


HE letter which we published last 
month on Negro migration to the 
United States was sent to us by the 
American Ambassador through the 
State Department. Was it doctored, 
changed or arranged by the State De- 
partment? We do not know. But on 
the other hand, we have received from 
an American attorney in Rio De Jan- 
eiro, a man of the highest reputation 
and of long residence, the following 
statement which did not come by way 
of the American Secretary of State. 
He says with regard to the refusal to 
allow Negroes to enter Brazil: 
“Replying to your letter of March 
21st, at my request, the American Vice- 
Consul in this city took up the matter 
with the Foreign Office and was ad- 
vised by one of the officials that no 
such law as you indicate has been 
enacted here and that the visé of the 
colored doctor must have been refused 
by the Brazilian Consulate on other 
grounds. Personally, I know of no 
legislation such as you mention and I 
think the reasons given must have been 
mistaken or misinterpreted.” 


“PUBLIC HEALTH” 
HE United States Public Health 


Service does not know what to 
do with its funds. It is, therefore, us- 
ing them in making “intelligence” tests 
in certain Southern cities, designed to 
prove that the average colored child 


167 


is sub-normal. 
under proper control it has been able 
to prove this to its own satisfaction in 


By putting the tests 


a number of cases. It has not, of 
course considered the Louisville test 
where the white children had the lar- 
ger proportion of sub-normal persons. 
In the meantime, however, one does 
feel like asking what business the 
United States Public Health Service 
has in wasting its funds in this kind 
of work? There is no scientific test 
of native intelligence and that every 
honest person knows. There are most 
interesting and valuable tests of human 
variation due to physical difference and 
environment, which might be helpful 
to education if separated from race 
prejudice and stupidity ; but the United 
States Public Health Service has no 
business in this field, no facilities for 
the work and no reputation for fair- 
ness and decency calculated to inspire 
any confidence. The Coolidge Ad- 
ministration would do well to ask 
with what warrant this such expendi- 
tures are being made. 


ALICE WORK 


LICE WORK, widow of John 

Work, is dead. She went back to 
Fisk. University ; back to the place that 
was the scene of her school days, of 
her love and marriage, of the birth of 
her children, and of her bitterest sor- 
row. She went back and took up her 
husband’s task of teaching the beauty 
of the Negro folk song to the young 
voices that are learning to sing to the 
world. She received a salary of $1,400 
a year and out of this gave $150 to the 
Fund for saving Fisk. She taught 
seven to ten hours a day, did her house- 
work, cared for her three children and 
supported them in school. She went 
up with her singers to St. Louis and 
there they sang: 

“Were you there when they crucified 

my Lord? 

“Were you there when they nailed 

him to the tree? 

“Were you there when they laid him 

in the tomb?” 

And then when she was done sing- 
ing, she died. They laid Alice 
Work in the tomb beside John. John 
was crucified at Fisk University and 
nailed to a terrible cross; may the 
resurrected Fisk yet restore something 
of that lost happiness to him, his family 
and his race. 





APPRECIATION 
FRIEND in Boston sent a sub- 
scription to THE Crisis as a gift 

to a lady of Allston. He received the 
following reply: 

“T should have let you know ere this, 
how more than grateful I am for the 
gift of THe Crisis. I can’t express 
by mere words my appreciation of this 
great kindness, but trust you can read 


168 


between these lines and fully under- 
stand all I wish I could explain, that 
would let you know that you’ve given 
another poor soul one of the most 
cherished pleasures, ic. THE Crisis 
which I love to read but can’t stretch 
a smail amount over the many needed 
things. I thank you very very much.” 

Has the reader ever thought how 
much happiness and information he 
might spread in this world by giving 
away a few subscriptions to THE 
Crisis? 


MUSICIANS 


E have received from a strug- 

gling musician who has already 
made unusual progress the following 
letter which we quote in part: 

“Can I urge you to give the public 
an editorial in THe Crisis that will 
help all future race artists:—by ask- 
ing the public to give 100% support 
to worthy artists who come to their 
city. The public can play a large part 
in encouraging artists by coming them- 
selves and by urging every friend to 
come. There are people who always 
want to know for what benefit the con- 
cert is given. Well, it’s for the bene- 
fit of those who come. ‘Then they 
wonder how much the promoter is 
getting. But they don’t ask that ques- 
tion, when they go to white concerts— 
i.e. if they are permitted to enter.’ 

“Do speak a strong word for the 
promoter of concerts. For he certainly 
deserves something for his work and 
for giving the public the opportunity 
to hear certain artists. A promoter 
runs a risk and the public should sup- 


‘port him. 


“T am sure we have many in our 
group who would study music seriously 
if they felt there was a future. But 
it takes thousands of dollars to prepare 
for a musical career and the public 
shouldn’t lessei: the artists’s value by 
refusing to pay a standard price. 

“We as a race have already won 
many friends through our music and 
we must do greater things in the fu- 
ture.” 


ROSE WARD HUNT 


E trust that the people of New 

York and of the United States 
realized slavery yesterday when the 
woman who was sold sixty-seven years 
ago in Beecher’s pulpit for $900, came 
back to New York and stood there 
again. There was a woman of beauty 
and of dignity. who was bartered like 
a horse in the 19th Century and in the 
land of freedom and democracv! And 
let us never forget that the bulk of 
the Christian Church, together with 
the wisest and richest of the people of 
the United States, defended this system 
for 250 vears; and there are some still 
defending it. 





THE BISHOPS 


Bishop Archibald Carey of Chicago 
has brought a grave question before 


‘the Board of Bishops of the African 


M. E. Church. Bishop Carey has 
accepted a position as Civil Service 
Commissioner of the City of Chicago 
with salary and duties that call for 
full time service. Bishop Cary at the 
same time is a bishop of the African 
M. E. Church with salary and work 
which calls for every ounce of his 
efforts. Previous to this, the question 
as to how far such a bishop can divide 
his services or give up his episcopal 
duties has come up before for discus- 
sion. Bishop Gregg was elected 
President of Howard University. It 
was a great and attractive duty; but 
the Board of Bishops did not feel that 
they could excuse him from his work 
and he did not feel that he ought to 
give up the hard service which calls 
him to South Africa. He therefore 
declined the position at Howard. But 
Bishop Carey apparently proposes to 
hold and to attempt to fill these two 
positions and to receive both salaries. 
What will the Board of Bishops of 
the A. M. E. Church do? They are 


fronted by a serious problem. 


FLOOD 


We hope that every Negro that can 
escape from the slave camps guarded 
by the National Red Cross for the 
benefit of the big planters of Missis- 
sippi and Louisiana and the lynchers 
of Arkansas will leave this land of 
deviltry at the first opportunity. Let 
them ride, run and crawl out of this 
hell. There is no hope for the black 
man there today. Relief funds are 
being used to pamper white folk 
and in some cases are actually being 
sold to black folk as the basis of con- 
tracts for their compulsory services in 
the future. Fully 75 per cent of the 
refugees have been Negroes and we 
doubt if they have received 25 per cent 
of the relief funds. 

We do not know where the refugees 
from the Mississippi bottoms can go, 
but we are frank to say it would be 
better for them to starve in Memphis 
and Chicago than to be slayes in Ar- 
kansas and Mississippi. Even if even- 
tually they have to return, they can 
make better terms than by staying. 

And they can expect no help from 
Coolidge or Hoover. Mr. Hoover is 
too busy having his picture taken and 
Mr. Coolidge, when the Arkansas 
mob burns the body of an imbecile, 
feeding the bonfire with lumber torn 
from a Negro church, while the 
Mayor of the city keeps the Negro 
leaders imprisoned in their own busi- 
ness block—Mr. Coolidge tells the 
world of the privileges of American 
civilization.

A FORWARD STEP 
(From page 150) 


T is the policy of the Department 
| to let the various students select 
the school they desire to attend; 
but the Board reserves the right to 
ascertain whether the aid granted by 
it, will enable the student to pursue 
the course desired in the college se- 
lected. This, of course, requires a 
thorough investigation of the appli- 
cant to determine whether the student, 
first, has the ability to carry on 
the selected course and second, if 
the assistance granted will enable 
the student to continue through the 
year. One of the requirements before 
the grant is made is that the applicant 
must consent to having his or her 
scholastic record sent to the Board of 
Education at the end of the quarter 
or semester, as the case may be, for 
study on the part of the Commissioner. 
This is being done and it is very grati- 
fying that all to whom assistance has 
been given are making at least aver- 
age passing grades.

women have been granted schol- 
arships and are attending the schools

This effort is not just for the sea- 
son, but is to be continuous. Each 
year it is-the purpose of our Order 
to grant additional scholarships and 
to continue those already granted if 
it appears that the student to whom 
an award has been made still is in need 
of assistance and his record shows that 
he possesses the ability to pursue the 
selected course. :

sisted the first year, will during the 
year make contacts which will make 
further assistance unnecessary. The 
object of the Order is to assist as many 
as possible in order to provide pre- 
pared men and women to furnish the 
proper kind of leadership for the 
Negro race. 


N_ addition to the scholarships 

granted, our Order is striving to 
create an unquenchable thirst for edu- 
cation among the American Negroes 
and in order to assist in this purpose 
our Fraternity established an annual 
Elks Educational Week and in April, 
1926, the first attempt was made. 
Our report shows that 257 meetings 
were held and attended by more than 
30,000 people. At these meetings pro- 
grams were rendered, including edu- 
cational addresses urging school at- 
tendance. During the week surveys 
were made in many localities to ascer- 
tain the number of children of school 
age that were out of school and the 
reasons why and to arrange, if pos- 
sible, the return of the pupils to 
school. In many instances our report 
shows that these efforts were success- 
ful. School authorities were visited 


and encouraged or constructively cri- 


ticized as the need indicated. The 
object of this particular effort is to 
overcome the impression that Negroes 
are not interested in schools except 
to get a Negro teacher either employed 
or discharged. As a result of this spe- 
cial effort, many communications have 
been sent to the Commissioner in 
charge of this department thanking 


the Order for the interest manifested. 


The Second Annual Elks Educa- 
tional Week was held the week be- 
ginning Sunday, April 10th, 1927, 
and progress was shown as compared 
with the first effort. 


UR Educational Department is 
fostering under an enactment 
passed by our Grand Lodge in August, 
1926, a National Oratorical Contest. 
The final contest to be held the latter 
part of May in Washington, D. C. 
For the final contest cash prizes ag- 
gregating $1,000 are offered. The 
country is divided into six sections 
and the winner of each sectional con- 
test participated in the final Contest. 
The winner of each sectional contest 
is awarded a scholarship of $250 in 
some college. Young men and women 
all over the country took a part in these 
contests. The subject discussed is the 
“Constitution of the United States”. 
It is the hope of the Order that in 
this way something can be done to 
counteract the prevalent opinion that 
the portion of-the Constitution that 
refers to manhood rights does not re- 
fer to American Negroes.

tective Order of Elks is not seeking 
self advertising in offering this pro- 
gram, but is endeavoring to do its part 
in preparing young American Negroes 
for their exacting duties. The age in 
which we live demands much of us 
and the Order hopes to assist in creat-

JUAN DE PAREJA 
(From page 154) “It is the only 
picture of Pareja that we have and we 
prize it as among the rarest of the 
collections of the Prado.” 


N_ Seville, I saw three other pic- 

tures done by the hands of a Negro. 
In the Baptisiry of the Basilica to the 
left. of the main entrance, there was 
the “Immaculate Conception” by Se- 
bastian Gomez, the mulatto servant 
of Murillo. It hangs near Murillo’s 
“St. Anthony” and still shows the 
marks of the vandal hands where it 
was cut out and afterward retrieved 
by William Schaus of America. In 
the Treasury is the “Holy Family” 
and in the Sacristy, “Christ Attached 
to a Column”. These three glorious 
canvasses have been saved by Provi- 
dence to further attest the work of 
the Negro painters in the 17th cen- 
tury. The fact that the works of 
Gomez and Pareja have been mistaken 
by some art critics for those of their 
masters is proof of their distinctive 
merit. 

May these canvasses live long in 
their respective sanctuaries and may 
many American Negroes traveling 
through Spain have an opportunity to 
see and enjoy these silent masterpieces 
perfumed by the spirit of the Prado

1927 











one of the first to issue a ringing de- 
nial proving the bias and falsity of 
General Bullard’s statements. Mr. 
Fish took part in the debates on the 
Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill in the House 
of Representatives, vigorously de- 
nouncing mob rule in the South and 
has sponsored a bill of his own which 
would appropriate funds to erect a 
monument in France to the heroic 
American colored soldiers who served 
with the French Army in the world 
war. 

In accordance with its plan of giving 
consideration not only to personal and 
political relations of the races, but to 
economic problems as well, the N. A. 
A. C. P. has invited and has been for- 
tunate in obtaining a speaker who is 
exceptionally qualified to speak on 
these problems, Charles S. Johnson, 
editor of Opportunity Magazine. Mr. 
Johnson edited the survey of the Negro 
in Chicago published after the Chicago 
race riots of 1919 by the Chicago Com- 
mittee on Race Relations and the book 
was an exhaustive examination not 
only of the conditions leading up to 
the riot, but of the Negro’s social and 
economic life in Chicago as well. Mr. 
Johnson’s subject at the Indianapolis 
Conference is to be “The Changing 
Economic Status of the Negro” and 
it is felt that probably no one in the 
country is better qualified than he to 
deal with it. 

The function of the church in play- 
ing a part for the betterment of race 
relations is universally recognised. 
The N. A. A. C.-P. has been fortunate 
in obtaining one of the most forceful 
of church leaders, the Right Rev. W. 
T. Vernon, Bishop of the A. M. E. 
Church, who will address the N. A. 
A. C. P. on “Politics, Religion and the 
Race Problem”. 

As in all previous years, officers and 
delegates as well as members of the 
N. A. A. C. -P. will play an impor- 
tant part in the Conference proceed- 
ings. Two of the Association’s staff 
have been in Europe within the year, 
Dr. Du Bois and Mr. Pickens having 
triumphantly carried the Association’s 
message to people in England, France, 
Germany and Russia. Dr. Du Bois 
has chosen to address the Conference 
on “Russia and her Race Problem” 
and as there are literally dozens of 
races included in the great extent of 
European and Asiatic Russia, his ad- 
dress will have much valuable in- 
formation. 

For the culminating night of the 
Conference, the closing night upon 
which the Spingarn Medal is pre- 
sented, the N. A. A. C. P. has invited 
and obtained the accevtance of the dis- 
tinguished novelist, Zona Gale, whose 
novel and play, “Miss Lulu Bett” are 
familiar to thousands of readers. Miss 
Gale will present the Spingarn. Medal

I’d have these notes so clear and light, 
These tones so gay and airy 

That they could fit into the throat 
Of any sort of fairy. 


The rhymes one writes for summer 
days 

Should suit the fancy of the fays, 

Bright, brisk and whimsical and 
merry, 

Fine measure for some fritillary. 


Say, Silver Spot, all violet fed, 
And hatched upon a violet bed. 
I’d tune my little songs just so 
For fritillaries as they go.

As long as the summer is here.

TEACHING BUSINESS 


(From page 157) laboratory for the 
application of business theory and prac- 
tice. The co-operative store is co-or- 
dinated with the commercial course of 
study and is employed to provide an 
opportunity for the development of 
powers of observation, discrimination, 
analysis and inference in the intricacies 
of store operation that lie dormant in 
the presence of the typical text book 
or course of lectures. 

The store is owned by student stock- 
holders. ‘The capital of the store was 
raised by selling stock in the Co-opera- 
tive Society at a price less than one 
dollar per share. ‘The store carries 
school books and school supplies, ath- 
letic goods, kodaks, toilet articles, some 
pastries made by the Domestic Science 
Department, confections and sundries, 
all of which are sold at the current 
prices in the city. Only stockholders 
receive sales tickets with purchases and 
of course only stockholders participate 
in dividends. Dividends are paid out 
of net profits at the end of the fiscal 
period on the basis of the stockhold- 
er’s purchases and not on the share of 
stock 


HE organization, government and 

operation of the store and Co- 
operative Society are very simple. The 
Board of Directors is elected from the 
respective classes of the School. Each 
stockholder has one vote. 

The manager of the store and his 
assistants are advanced students of 
the Commercial Department. The 
store manager and his organization, 
under faculty supervision, have a free

" personality, 


ministration. This gives the students 
the satisfaction of feeling that they 
are coming in contact with realities 
and handling some of the problems met 
in the business world. The store prac- 
tice enables the students to get a 
firmer grasp of the theory and prin- 
ciples of the classroom and develops a 
greater versatility in their application. 
The students begin to think for them- 
selves and in acquiring knowledge, get 
understanding. 

The manager gets the executive 
point of view by being held respon- 
sible for the business as a whole and 
for the successful operation and co- 
ordination of the related and inter- 
related departments of the business. 
The bookkeeper or accountant sees 
concretely the cost of leaks and how 
wholly dependent the business is upon 
accounting information for intelligent 
management. ‘The student in charge 
of purchasing visits wholesale houses 
where he gathers valuable information 
and makes business contacts. He ex- 
periences the temptation to “over buy” 
and realizes the necessity of having a 
knowledge of what the store patron- 
age wants and how important it is to 
have the right goods on hand at the 
right time. The students are respon- 
sible for the display of merchandise 
and the store advertising. ‘This calls 
for the application of the theory of 
advertising and at the same time 
provides opportunity for the students 
to draw on their own resourcefulness 
and to test their ability to get results. 
The selling practice in the store en- 
ables the instructor to convey con- 
cretely the premium that is placed upon 
business approach, tact, 
self-confidence and real service, all of 
which will add much to the student’s 
equipment for success in business. 


HE volume of business transacted 

by the store in its two years of 
operation has enabled the Co-operative 
Society to free itself of debt and have 
clear ownership of store equipment and 
stock of merchandise. In addition, 
the store has paid dividends of ten 
per cent on purchases made by stock- 
holders; has given nine scholarships 
to the extent of tuition; has inaugu- 
rated an annual banquet for the stock- 
holders; has qualified for membership 
in the Co-operative League of Amer- 
ica in 1925 and had a representative 
at the National Co-operative Congress 
at Minneapolis, 1926. This was the 
first time in the history of the Co-opera- 
tive Congress that a Negro representa- 
tive had attended. 

Commenting on the educational pro- 
ject, J. P. Warbasse, President 
of the Co-operative League of Amer- 
ica, writes: 

“The students are developing the 
capacity and understanding to carry 


on business for service. It is a sad 
fact that most young people enter and 
pass through our schools and colleges 
with no knowledge but that the only 
method of carrying on business is for 
making profits. Here and there a 
little instruction is given in the depart- 
ment of economics in which the stu- 
dents learn that it is possible for people 
to produce and distribute commodities 
and services for the benefit of consum- 
ers. But this is quite exceptional.” 

The West Virginia Review, Janu- 
ary, 1927, comments on the project: 

“One of the most interesting experi- 
ments discovered in connection with 
any school in the State is a co-opera- 
tive store managed by the students in 
the Commercial Department of the 
Bluefield Institute.” 

From Harvard University Gradu- 
ate School of Education came a com-’ 
ment from Dr. F. G. Nichols: 

“T am convinced that you are doing 
a splendid piece of work with this en- 
terprise. ... I have spent consider- 
able time at Hampton Institute, Vir- 
ginia, and from my knowledge of that 
Institution I am inclined to believe 
that in your schools the co-operative 
store offers the best type of practical 
experience for your students.” 


IKE any educational device, the 

laboratory method may be pushed 
too far; it would be absurd to expect 
the students to learn all the facts 
about business theory and practice by 
experimentation. But when properly 
employed, by specific examples the ab- 
stract is made more concrete, the in- 
tangible more comprehensive. 

The advantages accruing to the 
general student body from the educa- 
tional project in co-operative business 
are many. Aside from the laboratory 
practice and monetary benefits derived, 
co-operative business acquaints the 
general student body with methods and 
policies of business administration, de- 
velops an awakened and _ intelligent 
economic interest and promotes the 
spirit of social service. 

The two years of experience with 
the educational project at the Blue- 
field Institute leads the writer to be- 
lieve that, in the field of real co-opera- 
tive business, the school affords un- 
limited opportunity for the play of in- 
dividual business initiative, while it 
gives substance to the hope that co- 
operative business can be of material 
service in Negro life, when it is 
founded on proved principles and com- 
petently administered.
