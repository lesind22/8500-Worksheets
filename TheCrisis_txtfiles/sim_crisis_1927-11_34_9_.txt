BUBUBOMO TUB 





HE people—millions of them—are ac- 
tually demanding a great industrial 
change from Mass Production to Quality 


Production. They are showing this mood 
in the world of transportation—as proof I 
need merely call attention to the condition 
of the greatest automobile factories of the 
world. 


In so many words the public has given 
me to understand just this— 


‘We do not want to save to the point of 
sacrificing individuality. We are willing to 
pay more for what we get—provided it 
meets the artistic standards of quality pro- 
duction, style, personality, distinction, beau- 
ty, and a degree of exclusiveness.” 


Recognizing cold facts, we have decided to 
institute a vast publishing change. We shall 
close out our present stock of something like 
3,000,000 Little Blue Books, and then we 
shall announce a new series of books—good 
books—but not to sell at 5 cents per copy. 
We shall bow to industrial evolution, and 
issue books at a higher price—books care- 
fully selected for editorial content; books 
printed on very fine paper, bound in beauti- 
ful covers in many attractive colors. The 
type will be different. Expensive engravings 
will be used. The best artists will help us 
turn out a splendid article for the most dis- 
criminating readers. 


How soon will we announce the new 
series? We cannot state this definitely, 
though it should be soon. We must first 
dispose of our stock of Little Blue Books. 
The quicker they are distributed and turned 
into cash, the sooner will we be able to set 
our machines to work on our new publishing 
program. 


If we dispose of these 3,000,000 Little 
Blue Books within the next 30 days—and 
that is not impossible—we shall be able to 
begin our new program at that time. 


So we say this to the reading public of 
America—buy Little Blue Books now, while 
they are obtainable. Pick out your favorites 
while we have a complete stock to select 
from. 


We can fill your order now, but we can- 
not guarantee how long our supply will last.

INSURANCE PREMIUM 


ee KEY TO | 
sere ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE 


Did you ever think, when paying your weekly premium to your 
Southern Aid Agent, what an immense amount of good that premium 
does? Well, follow it through. 


That premium gives you a set sum weekly when you are disabled 
by sickness or accident; or, in case of death, a sum to provide a decent 
burial or a nest egg for a loved one. As worry about such things takes all 
the joy out of life, that premium makes life more enjoyable and secure. 


The above protective features of that premium are only a part of the 
good that it does. That premium also helps to provide employment for 
the agent who collects it, as well as the officers and clerks in charge of 
the business. That premium goes into banks with thousands of others 
and thus swells the funds that are loaned to responsible people to buy 
homes, to conduct business or professions, or to educate children. Thus 
that premium protects you, and also benefits the doctor, nurse, land- 
lord, groceryman, clothier, banker, and even the undertaker. 


Now, the question is: Are you placing as many of those premiums as 
possible where they will do the most good for you and your people?

r THE assembly of the League of “® ww 

Nations has done a fine and : 

brave thing by insisting upon As the Crow Flies 

pushing the work of world disarma- tlie 


ment despite the propaganda of or- 
ganized murder in the shape of armies 
and navies. Peace sentiment is grow- 
ing everywhere—The American Le- 
gion has been clowning it in Paris and 
turning a solemn pilgrimage into a 
gay holiday. The dead sleep on.—lf 
any lady in the United States has a 
superfluous husband, we beg to recom- 
mend the State of New Jersey. There 
are plenty of stray Negroes there who 
can be accused and be put in jail.— 
At last the United States has received 
a tariff punch in the eye. We have 
long asserted the divine right of pre- 
venting foreigners from selling us the 
goods we want. But what right has 
France to play this same little game? 
—This month Russia celebrates ten 
years of freedom from the tyranny of 
the Czars. Congratulations.—The 
United States of Europe is becoming 
a matter of buying and selling and 
fear of America—Great Britain is 
using Russian oil, not to calm angry 
waters, but to light a world conflagra- 
tion—The United States has sent its 


chief tailor’s model to Italy in order 
to teach Mussolini American race 
prejudice.—Persons who know what 
William E. Borah will do, say or think 
on any of the great questions that face 
mankind today are asked to communi- 
cate their knowledge to the American 
public at the earliest opportunity.— 
J. P. Morgan and Company will rep- 
resent the United States in Mexico. 
Well, what is there new about that? 
—England has increased her power in 
the Council of the League of Nations 
by one vote, Canada. Of course, Can- 
ada asserts her independence; but wait 
until the English Navy speaks and the 
English investor cracks his whip.— 
Cuba replaces Belgium as an elected 
member of the Council of the League 
of Nations. Thus the West Indies 
are recognized.—White civilization is 
blossoming in Indiana. One governor 
has just left the penitentiary; another 
seems to be on his way thither; and 
the mayor of Indianapolis is sentenced

tics win again in Pennsylvania simply 
because the respectable people of Penn- 
sylvania vote for Vare.—Walter 
Hampden is a worthy successor of 
John Drew as president of the Play- 
ers Club. The New York stage has 
four Negro plays so far this season 
and more to come.—The colleges, col- 
ored and white, are full of students. 
—American oi] men who placed great 
faith in the Mexican revolution are at 
least temporarily disappointed by the 
fate of Francisco Serrano and Alfredo 
Quijano.—Down in Kentucky they are 
voting about one thing and talking 
about another, as is usual in the South. 
They talk about race track betting; 
they vote on the Negro.—Japan has a 
fleet of warships visiting New York 
harbor. This is a gesture that Amer- 
ica understands and appreciates. It is 
“western” civilization —T. P. O’Con- 
nor, Irish member of Parliament from 
Liverpool, has finished seventy-nine

THE Crisis 





Building of the People’s Finance Corporation in St. Louis 








HE establishment of finance 
companies by Negroes has been 
forced upon them by sheer 
necessity. Prior to 1922, the colored 
citizens of St. Louis, like other large 
cities, were compelled to pay white 
real estate operators and small loan 
sharks whatever brokerage they 
charged for loans. ‘Today, to a large 
extent, this unfortunate situation has 
been relieved since the establishment 
of the People’s Finance Corporation. 
This institution was organized in Oc- 
tober, 1922, with a capital of $50,000. 
The original capital has been increased 
at various times; first to $100,000, 
then to $175,000, and finally to $250,- 
000. During the five years of its suc- 
cessful operation, the company has 
made loans amounting to over $l,- 
250,000 in amounts from $25 and up. 
The smaller loans are known as In- 
dustrial loans and the borrower is re- 
quired to secure two co-makers upon 
his note who guarantee prompt and 
full payment. The Real Estate loans 
usually extend over a period of two 
or three years and are payable in 
monthly installments. The payments, 
as nearly as possible, are made to fit 
the financial status of the borrower. 


HE People’s Finance Corporation 

of St. Louis has combined re- 
sources now amounting to nearly a 
million dollars and has nearly one thou- 
sand stockholders, the largest number 
of stockholders of any colored finan- 
cial organization in the country. Last 
year the company opened its new office

building, which is located at one of 
the most strategic points in the city. 
The building and equipment represent 
an outlay of nearly a half million dol- 
lars and is indeed a monument to ra- 
cial progress and achievement. The 
building contains a basement which is 
used for lodge rooms and recreational 
purposes. The first floor contains the 
spacious banking quarters of the Peo- 
ple’s Finance Corporation, including a 
large Safe Deposit vault which can 
accommodate 3,000 individual boxes. 
Seven stores and a large cafeteria are 
also on the first floor. The second, 
third and fourth floors contain ninety- 
one offices, many of which are arranged 
in suites. The fifth floor contains a 
beautiful Auditorium which is ad- 
joined by a Solarium, with a seating 
capacity for 1,200 people. The Audi- 
torium also contains a stage, ladies’ 
and gentlemen’s dressirfg rooms, a van- 
ity room and smoking rooms. A roof 
garden is also on the fifth floor. The 
entire building is fully occupied. It 
is generally conceded that the People’s 
Finance Corporation has proven one 
of the most constructive forces St. 
Louis has ever had. It has increased 
Negro business, helped to save many 
Negro homes and, above all, has been 


a great stimulus to the economic de- 
velopment of the Negro. 


OCAL white business men regard 

the People’s Finance Corporation 

as one of the outstanding institutions 

of the city. The State Finance Com- 

missioner has recently written as fol- 
lows: 


“IT want to say I was delightfully 
surprised with your wonderful build- 
ing and the splendid group of men I 
found in connection with your com- 
pany. I feel I have made no mistake 
in granting your company a permit to 
sell its securities to investors in this 
state.” 

The success of the People’s Finance 
Corporation in St. Louis, has not re- 
mained in St. Louis alone. Other 
cities, including Detroit, Kansas City, 
Chicago, Newark, New York and 
Cleveland, have already organized suc- 
cessful companies or are now in the 
process of organization. The St. 
Louis institution has received requests 
from many of the larger cities for the 
establishment of similar companies. 
The possibilities for such organiza- 
tions may be gained from the capital 
already raised by these companies, as 
follows: People’s Finance Corporation 
of St. Louis, capital $250,000 ; Detroit, 
$100,000; Cleveland, $100,000; Kan- 
sas City, $100,000; Newark, $100,000. 
Kansas City was organized last Octo- 
ber and has perhaps made the most 
rapid strides of any of ‘the organiza- 
tions. (Turn to page 314)

Democracy In Mississipp1 


HE Negro vote.in Mississippi 1s 

almost negligible. This condition 
is due primarily to the flagrant refusal 
of Democratic registration officers to 
permit Negroes to register. 

The requirements for registration in 
this state are that the applicants must 
be able to “read and write, or under- 
stand the Constitution when read to 
them” and must have paid their poll tax 
for the past two years prior to the time 
at which they offer for registration. 

The Clerk of the Circuit court in 

each county, or his deputy, is the sole 
judge of every one’s ability to qualify 
for registration and he is invariably a 
Democrat and adamant. All white- 
folk are “qualified”. If a white person 
cannot read or write, such person is 
always able to “understand the con- 
stitution when read’’, Hence, all white 
tolk vote. 

When a colored man comes up to 
register, as a rule, he is either uncere- 
moneously ordered out of the office 
with an oath before a question even 
has been asked; or is told by the clerk 
that he is busy and hasn’t time to reg- 
ister him; or is given something to read 
or asked a question, only to have the 
registration book closed, slammed to 
and be told that he cannot qualify. 

This is the rule after a few are reg- 
istered, regardless of the qualifications 
of the applicant. These only too often 
are far superior to those of the regis- 
trar whose literary attainments many 
times are not above those of the sev enth 
or eighth grade pupil. 

Often the applicant is threatened, is 
told that the white folk are watching 
him, that the Negroes are getting along 
very well there now, but that just such 

“niggers” as he (the applicant) are 
fixing to get a lot of “niggers” killed. 

In several other instances I have 
been told of many Negroes being driven 
out of the clerk’s office which is in the 
Court House, at the point of a gun, 
merely for having asked to register. _ 

And one must have first been regis- 
tered by this circuit clerk and present 
a certificate to that effect, before being 
permitted to register in the cities or 
towns. In that way, as you see, this 
clerk is the sole arbiter of the destiny 
of the Negro voter, or rather, would 
be voter. 

It is quite a difficult matter to ob- 
tain exact information as to the number 
of Negroes registered in most of the 
counties since, as a rule, one would 
have to send some one to each 
county to examine the records per- 
sonally ; the clerks are very “touchous” 
on the subject of the number of reg- 
istered Negro voters, it appearing that 


oOo e* 
A Study of Negro Suffrage 
oe = 


know the small number registered or 
they look upon inquiry with suspicion 
as an effort made to have the Negroes 
registered in larger numbers. 


FRIEND of mine wrote several 
clerks some time ago making in- 
quiry as to the number of Negroes reg- 
istered in their counties and received 
“curt” replies. I obtained the figures 
directly from the clerks themselves 
trom fourteen counties over long dis- 
tance phone which worked like a 
charm, much better than writing them. 
I went at it in a round about way by 
asking for the total registered vote of 
the county; how many Democrats reg- 
istered; how many Republicans and 
if there were any “darkies” registered ; 
if so how many. In that way I got 
it, the number of Negroes registered 
appearing to be only incidental. By 
using the word “darkies” they thought 
1 was white. 

There is nothing on this point in the 
office of the Secretary of State at 
Jackson, but I have had the records 
examined in several of the largest 
counties of the State and find the fol- 
lowing number of Negroes registered:

OVERNOR BILBO recently 
nominated, which means elected, 
Governor of Mississippi for the en- 
suing term, stated recently to a re- 
porter on the New York Times: 
“There are not 2,000 Negroes quali- 
fied to vote”. 
United States census of 1920 declares 
that of 453,663 Negroes 21. years of 
age and over living in Mississippi 
290,782 can read and write. 

I know personally of many instances 
where college graduates from some of 
the best schools and professional men 
were refused registration on the ground 
that they “couldn’t read”. This is 
common. 

In most counties, as I have said, they 


they either don’t want the world towill register a dozen or so Negroes 


296 


On the other hand the ~ 


but whenever it looks as if any con- 
siderable number is desirous of regis- 
tering, the books are invariably and 
irrevocably “closed”. 

The Negro vote is smaller now than 
a year ago, since the last legislature 
called for a new registration and it ap- 
pears that it is a most difficult matter 
to get as many on the rolls as were reg- 
istered before. For example, in Hinds, 
the largest county in the State, there 
were 98 Negroes registered a year ago, 
but only 60 now. I am enclosing a 
clipping showing the vote in the last 
Congressional election, which is self 
explanatory: 

As you will see, there were only 
thirty thousand votes cast in the en- 
tire State, for the entire eight con- 
gressmen out of a 300,000 Democratic 
registration; and had it not been that 
there were several levee constitutional 
amendments to be voted on, in which 
there was much interest, the vote 
would not have been over 12,000 or 
15,000 for the entire state, for a con- 
gressional election. 


fe wees the following record in the 
Secretary of State’s office which 
gives the vote for state officers in No- 
vember, 1923: 


For Henry L. Whitfield for Gov- 


All other candidates for state offices 
received about the same vote. None 
of them had opposition. 

In 1924 the Democratic presidential 
electors received 100,476 votes, the 
Coolidge electors received 8,494 votes 
and the progressives 3,448. 

In 1924 the Democrats made a most 
unusual effort to get out a large vote 
in order to answer criticism. President 
Harding received 10,000 votes in this 
state in 1920. Hence you notice a 
small falling off in the Republican vote 
in 1924. 

The Federal Courts will not use 
Negro jurors hereafter as a rule, due 
to the fact that all jurors will be 
drawn strictly from the boxes prepared 
by the local Democratic Circuit clerks 
and, of course, they would never put 
a Negro’s name in the box. 

Heretofore, there have always been 
several Negroes drawn in the Federal 
Courts. 

After going into this thing and find- 
ing the numbers so small in some coun- 
ties my interest grew and I inquired 
further than I had intended after 
getting so few responses to many 
ietters of inquiry sent out. But the 
truth is most Negroes are even afraid 
to inquire as to such matters in view 
of the fact they will be termed “med- 
dlesome” or “bad niggers”.

One Boy's Story 


A Story by JOSEPH MAREE ANDREW 


’M glad they got nie shut up in here. 

Gee, I’m glad! I used to be afraid 
to walk in the dark and-to stay by 
myself. 

That was when I was ten years old. 
Now I am eleven. 

My mother and I used to live up 
in the hills right outside of Somerset. 
Somerset, you know is way up State 
and there aren’t many people there. 
Just a few rich people in big houses 
and that’s all. 

Our house had a nice big yard be- 
hind it, beside it and in front of it. I 


used to play it was my fortress and 


that the hills beside us were full of 
Indians. Some days I’d go on scouting 
parties up and down the hills and fight. 

That was in the summer and fall. 
In the winter and when the spring 
was rainy, I used to stay in the house 
and read. 

I love to read. I love to lie on the 
floor and put my elbows down and 
read and read myself right out of So- 
merset and of America—out of the 
world, if I want to. 


HERE was just my mother and 

I. No brothers—no sisters—no 
father. My mother was awful pretty. 
She had a roundish plump, brown face 
and was all plump and round herself. 
She had black hair all curled up on 
the end like a nice autumn leaf. 

She used to stay in the house all the 
time and sew a lot for different ladies 
who came up from the big houses in 
Somerset. She used to sew and I 
would pull the bastings out for her. 
I did not mind it much. I liked to 
look at the dresses and talk about the 
people who were to wear them. 

Most people, you see, wear the same 
kind of dress goods all the time. Mrs. 
Ragland always wore stiff silk that 
sounded like icicles on the window. 
Her husband kept the tea and coffee 
store in Somerset and everybody said 
he was a coming man. 

I used to wonder where he was 
coming to. 

Mrs. Gregg always had the kind of 
silk that you had to work carefully 
for it would ravel into threads. She 
kept the boarding house down on For- 
sythe Street. I used to like to go to 
that house. When you looked at it 
on the outside and saw all the win- 
dows and borders running up against 
it you thought ,you were going in a 
palace. But when you got inside you 
saw all the little holes in the carpet 
and the mended spots in the curtains 
and the faded streaks in the places 
where the draperies were folded.

The pale soft silk that always. made 
me feel like burying my face in it be- 
longed to Mrs. Swyburne. She was 
rich—awful rich. Her husband used 
to be some kind of doctor and he found 
out something that nobody else had 
found out, so people used to give him 
plenty of money just to let him tell 
them about it. They called him a spe- 
cialist. 


E was a great big man. Nice and 

tall and he looked like he must 

have lived on milk and beef-juice and 

oranges and tomato juice and all the 

stuff Ma makes me eat to grow. His 

teeth were white and strong so I guess 
he chewed his crusts too. 

Anyhow, he was big but his wife 
was all skinny and pale. Even her 
eyes were almost skinny and pale. 
They were sad like and she never 
talked much. My mother used to say 
that those who did not have any chil- 
dren did not have to talk much any- 
how. 

She said that to Mrs. Swyburne one 
time. Mrs. Swyburne had been sit- 
ting quiet like she used to, looking at 
me. She always’ looked at me any- 
how, but that day she looked harder 
than ever. 

Every time I raised 0 up my head and 
breathed the bastings out of my face, 
I would see her looking at me. 

I always hated to have her look at 
me. Her eyes were so sad they made 


me feel as if she wanted something I 
had. 

Not that I had anything to give her 
because she had all the money and cars 
and everything and I only had my 
mother and Cato, my dog, and some 
toys and books. 

But she always looked that way at 
me and that day she kept looking so 
long that pretty soon I sat up and 
looked at her hard. 

She sort of smiled then and said, 
“Do you know, Donald, I was wish- 
ing I had a little boy just like you to 
pull out bastings for me, too.” 

“You couldn’t have one just like 
me,” I said right off quick. Then I 
quit talking because Ma commenced 
to frown even though she did not look 
up at me. 


QUIT because I was going to say, 

“*’Cause I’m colored and you 
aren't,’ when Ma frowned. 

Mrs. Swyburne still sort of smiled; 
then she turned her lips away from 
her teeth the way I do when Ma gives 
me senna and manna tea. 

“No,” she said, “I couldn’t have a 
little boy like you, I guess.” 

Ma spoke right up. “I guess you 
do not want one like him! You have 
to talk to him so much.” 

I knew she meant I talked so much 
and acted so bad sometimes. 

Mrs. Swyburne looked at Ma then. 
She looked at her hair and face and 
right down to her feet. Pretty soon 
she said: “You cannot mind that 
surely. You seem to have all the 
things I haven’t anyway.” Her lips 
were still held in that lifted, twisted 
way. 

Ma turned around to the machine 
then and turned the wheel and caught 
the thread and it broke and the scis- 
sors fell and stuck up in the floor. 
I heard her say “Jesus”, to herself 
like she was praying. 

I didn’t say anything. I ripped out 
the bastings. Ma stitched. Mrs. 
Swyburne sat there. I sort of peeped 
up at her and I saw a big fat tear 
sliding down her cheek. 

I kind of wiggled over near her and 
laid my hand on her arm. Then Ma 
yelled: “Donald, go and get a pound 
of rice! Go now, I said.” 

I got scared. She had not said it 
before and she had a lot of rice in a 
jar in the closet. But I didn’t dare 
say so. I went out. 

I couldn’t help but think of Mrs. 
Swyburne. She ought not to cry so 
easy. She might not have had a little 
boy and Ma might have —but she 


297 








































should have been happy. She had a 
great big house on the swellest street 
in Somerset and a car all her own and 
some one to drive it for her. Ma only 
had me and our house which wasn’t 
so swell, but it was all right. 


HEN Mrs. Swyburne had her hus- 

band and he had such a nice 
voice. You didn’t mind leaning on 
his knee and talking to him as soon 
as you saw him. He had eyes that 
looked so smiling and happy and when 
you touched his hands they were soft 
and gentle as Ma’s even if they were 
bigger. 

I knew him real well. He and | 
were friends. He used to come to 
our house a lot of times and bring 
me books and talk to Ma while I read. 

He knew us real well. He called 
Ma Louise and me Don. Sometimes 
he’d stay and eat supper with us and 
then sit down and talk. I never could 
see why he’d come way out there to 
talk to us when he had a whole lot of 
rich friends down in Somerset and a 
wife that looked like the only doll I 
ever had. 

A lady gave me that doll once and 
I thought she was really pretty—all 
pale and blonde and rosy. I thought 
she was real pretty at first but by and 
by she seemed so dumb. She never 
did anything but look pink and pale 
and rosy and pretty. She never went 
out and ran with me like Cato did. 
So I just took a rock and gave her a 
rap up beside her head and threw her 
in the bushes. 

Maybe Mrs. Swyburne was pale 
and pink and dumb like the doll and 
her husband couldn’t rap her with a 
rock and throw her away. 

I don’t know. 


NYHOW, he used to come and 
talk tous and he’d talk to Ma 
a long time after I was in bed. Some- 
times I’d wake up and hear them talk- 
ing. He used to bring me toys until 
he found out that I could make my 
own toys and that I liked books. 
After that he brought me_ books. 
All kinds of books about fairies and 
Indians and folks in other countries. 
Sometimes he and I would talk 
about the books—especially those I 
liked. The one I liked most was called 
“Ten Tales to Inspire Youth”. 
That sounds kind of funny but the 
book was great. It had stories in it 
all about men. All men. I read all 
of the stories but I liked the one about 
the fellow named Orestes who went 
home from the Trojan War and found 
his mother had married his father’s 
brother so he killed them. I was al- 
ways sorry for the woman with the 
whips of flame like forked tongues who 
used to worry him afterwards. I don’t 


298 


see why the fairies pursued him. They 
knew he did it because he loved his 
father so much. 

Another story I liked was about 
Oedipus—a Greek too—who put out 
his eyes to hurt himself because he 
killed his father and married his 
mother by mistake. 

But after I read “David and Go- 
liath”, I just had to pretend that I 
was David. 

I swiped a half a yard of elastic 
from Ma and hunted a long time un- 
til I found a good forked piece of 
wood. Then I made a swell sling 
shot. 


HE story said that David asked 

Jehovah (which was God) to let 
his sling-shot shoot good. “Do thou 
lend thy strength to my arm, Jehovah”, 
he prayed. 

I used to say that too just to be like 
him. 

I told Dr. Swyburne I liked these 
stories. 

“Why do you like them?” he asked 
me. . 
“Because they are about men,” I 
said. 

“Because they are about men! Is 
that the only reason?” 

Then I told him no; that I liked 
them because the men in the stories 
were brave and had courage and stuck 
until they got what they wanted, even 
if they hurt themselves getting it. 

And he laughed and said, to Ma: 
“Louise he has the blood, all right!” 

And Ma said: “Yes! He is a true 
Gage. They’re brave enough to put 
their eyes out too. That takes courage 
all right!” 

Ma and I are named Gage, so I 
stuck out my chest and said: “Ma, 
which one of us Gages put his eyes 
out ?” 

“Me,” she said—and she was stand- 
ing there looking right at me! 

I thought she was making fun. So 
I felt funny. 


R. SWYBURNE turned red and 

said: “I meant the other blood, 
of course. All the Swyburnes are 
heroes.” 


I didn’t know what he meant. 


My 


name is Gage and so is Ma’s so he. 


didn’t mean me. 

Ma threw her head up and looked 
at him and says: “Oh, are they 
heroes?” Then she says real quick: 
“Donald go to bed right now!” 

I didn’t want to go but I went. I 
took a long time to take off my clothes 
and I heard Ma and Dr. Swyburne 
talking fast like they were fussing. 

I couldn’t hear exactly what they 
said but I kept hearing Ma say: “I’m 
through!” 


And I heard Dr. Swyburne say: 
FYou can’t be!” 

I kind of dozed to sleep. 
by I heard Ma say again: 
I’m through!” 

And Dr. Swyburne said: 
let you be!” 

Then I rolled over to think a min- 
ute and then go downstairs maybe. 

But when I rolled over again, the 
sun was shining and I had to get up. 

Ma never said anything about what 
happened so I didn’t either. She just 
walked around doing her work fast, 
holding her head up high like she al- 
ways does when I make her mad. 

So I never said a thing that day. 


By and 
“Well, 


“IT won’t 


NE day I came home from school. 

I came in the back way and when 
1 was in the kitchen I could hear a 
man in the front room talking to Ma. 
I stood still a minute to see if it was 
Dr. Swyburne though I knew he never 
comes in the afternoon. 

The voice didn’t sound like his so 
I walked in the hall and passed the 
door. The man had-his back to me 
so I just looked at him a minute and 
didn’t say anything. He had on 
leather leggins and a sort of uniform 
like soldiers wear. He was stooping 
over the machine talking to Ma and 
I couldn’t see his face. 

Just then I stumbled over the little 
rug in the hall and he stood up and 
looked at me. : 

He was a colored man! Colored 
just like Ma and me. You see, there 
aren’t any other people in Somerset 
colored like we are, so I was sort of 
surprised to see him. 

“This is my son, Mr. Frazier,” Ma 
said. 

I said pleased to meet you and 
stepped on Ma’s feet. But not on pur- 
pose. You know I kind of thought he 
was going to be named Gage and be 
some relation to us and stay at our 
house awhile. 


I never saw many colored people— 
no colored men—and I wanted to see 
some. When Ma called him Frazier 
it made my feet slippery so I stubbed 
my toe. 


“Hello, son!” he said nice and quiet. 


E didn’t talk like Ma and me. 

He talked slower and softer. I 

liked him straight off so I grinned and 
said: “Hello yourself.” 

“How’s the books?” he said then. 

I didn’t know what he meant at first 
but I guessed he meant school. So I 
said: “Books aren’t good as the 
fishin’.”” 

He laughed out loud and said I 
was all right and said he and I were 
going to be friends and that while he 
was in Somerset he was going to come 
to our house often and see us.

Then he went out. Ma told me 
he was driving some lady’s car. She 
was visiting Somerset from New York 
and he would be there a little while. 

Gee, I was so glad! I made a fish- 
ing rod for him that very afternoon 
out of a piece of willow I had been 
saving for a long time. 

And one day, he and I went down 
to the lake and fished. We sat still 
on top a log that went across a little 
bay like. I felt kind of excited and 
couldn’t say a word. I just kept look- 
ing at him every once in a while and 
smiled. I did not grin. Ma said I 
grinned too much. 


RETTY soon he said: “What 
are you going to be when you 
grow up, son?” 

“A colored man,” I said. I meant 
to say some more, but he hollered and 
laughed so loud that Cato had to run 
up and see what was doing. 

“Sure you'll be a colored man! No 
way to get out of that! But I mean 
this: What kind of work are you 
going to do?” 

I had to think a minute. I had to 
think of all the kinds of work men 
did. Some of the men in Somerset 
were farmers. Some kept stores. 
Some swept the streets. Some were 
rich and did not do anything at home 
but they went to the city and had their 
cars driven to the shop and to meet 
them at the train. 

All the conductors and porters make 
a lot of scramble to get these men on 
and off the train, even if they looked 
as if they could take care of them- 
selves. ; 

So I said to Mr. Frazier: “I want 
to have an office.” 

“An office?” 

“Yes. In the city so’s I can go in 
to it and have my car meet me when 
I come to Somerset.” 

“Fat chance a colored man has!” 
he said. 

“T can too have an office!” I said. 
He made me sore. “I can have one if 
I want to! I want to have an office 
and be a specialist like Dr. Swyburne.” 


R. FRAZIER dropped his pole 
and had to swear something 
awful when he reached for it though 
it wasn’t very far from him. 
“Why’d you pick him?” he said and 
looked at me kind of mad like and be- 
fore I could think of what to say he 
said: “Say son, does that guy come 
up to see your mother?” 
“Sure he comes to see us both!” I 
said. 


Mr. Frazier laughed again but not 
out loud. It made me sore all over. 
I started to hit him with my pole but 
I thought about something I’d read 
once that said even a savage will treat 


November, 1927 


you right in his house—so I didn’t hit 
him. Of course, he wasn’t in my 
house exactly but he was sitting on 
my own log over my fishing places and 
that’s like being in your own house. 

Mr. Frazier laughed to himself 
again and then all of a sudden he 
took the pole I had made him out of 
the piece of willow I had been saving 
for myself and laid it across his knees 
and broke. it in two. Then he said 
out loud: “Nigger women,” and then 
threw the pole in the water. 

I grabbed my pole right out of the 
water and slammed it across his face. 
I never thought of the hook until I 
hit him, but it did not stick in him. 
It caught in a tree and I broke the 
string yanking it out. 

He looked at me like he was going 
to knock me in the water and even 
though I was scared, I was thinking 
how I’d let myself fall if he did knock 
me off—so that I could swim out with- 
out getting tangled in the roots under 
the bank. 


UT he didn’t do it. He looked at 
me a minute and said: “Sorry, 
son! Sorry! Not your fault.” 

Then he put his hand on my hair 
and brushed it back and sort of lifted 
it up and said: “Like the rest.” 

I got up and said I was going home 
and he came too. I was afraid he 
would come in but when he got to my 
gate he said: “So long,” and walked 
right on. 

I went on in. Ma was sewing. 
She jumped up when I came in. 

“Where is Mr. Frazier?” she asked 
me. She didn’t even say hello to me! 

“T hit him,” I said. 

“You hit him!” she hollered. “You 
hit him! What did you do that for? 
Are you crazy?” 

I told her no. “He said ‘nigger 
women’ when I told him that Dr. Swy- 
burne was a friend of ours and came 
to see us.” 

Oh Ma looked terrible then. I 
can’t tell you how she did look. Her 
face sort of slipped around and twisted 
like the geography says the earth does 
when the fire inside of it gets too hot. 


HE never said a word at first. She 

just sat there. Then she asked 
me to tell her all about every bit that 
happened. 

I told her. She kept wriggling from 
side to side like the fire was getting 
hotter. When I finished, she said: 
“Poor baby! My baby boy! Not your 
fault! Not your fault!” 

That made me think of Mr. Frazier 
so I pushed out of her arms and said: 
“Ma your breast pin hurts my face 
when you do that!” 

She leaned over on the arms of her 
chair and cried and ‘cried until I cried 
too. 


All that week I’d think ot the fire 
inside of the earth when I looked at 
Ma. She looked so funny and she kept 
talking to herself. 

On Saturday night we were sitting 
at the table when I heard a car drive 
up the road. 

“Here’s Dr. Swyburne!” I said 
and I felt so glad I stopped eating. 

“He isn’t coming here!” Ma said 
and then she jumped up. 

“Sure he’s coming,” I said. “I 
know his motor.” And I started to 
get up too. 

“You stay where you are!” Ma 
hollered and she went out and closed 
the door behind her. 

I took another piece of cake and 
began eating the frosting. I heard 
Dr. Swyburne come up on the porch. 

“Hello, Louise,” he said. I could 
tell he was smiling by his voice. 

I couldn’t hear what Ma said at 
first but pretty soon I heard her say: 
“You can’t come here any more!” 


HAT hurt my feelings. I liked 
Dr. Swyburne. I liked him bet- 
ter than anybody I knew besides Ma. 

Ma stayed out a long time and by 
and by she came in alone and I heard 
Dr. Swyburne drive away. 

She didn’t look at me at all. She 
just leaned back against the door and 
said: “Dear Jesus! With your help 
I'll free myself.” 

I wanted to ask her from what did 
she want to free herself. It sounded 
like she was in jail or an animal in a 
trap in the woods. 

I thought about it all during supper 
but I didn’t dare say much. I thought 
about it and pretended that she was 
shut up in a prison and I was a time 
fighter who beat all the keepers and 
got her out. 

Then it came to me that I better 
get ready to fight to get her out of 
whatever she was in. I never said any- 
thing to her. I carried my air-rifle 
on mty back and my slingshot in my 
pocket. I wanted to ask her where 
her enemy was, but she never talked 
to me about it; so I had to keep quiet 
too. You know Ma always got mad 
if I talked about things first. She 
likes to talk, then I can talk after- 
wards. 

One Sunday she told me she was 
going for a walk. 

“Can I go?” I asked her. 

“No,” she said. “You play around 
the yard.” : 

Then she put her hat on and stood 
looking in the mirror at herself for a 
minute. All of a sudden I heard her 
say to herself: ‘All I need is strength 
to fight out of it.” 

“Ma’am?” I thought she was talk- 
ing to me at first.

ILD geese have long been pro- 

nounced weather prophets. A 
wise looking old lady from Pennsyl- 
vania once told me that she had 
watched a flock of geese forming them- 
selves into letters in the sky and the 
letters were “H” and “W”, which, 
according to the old lady, meant hard 
winter. 

It is well that the geese are so wise 
and can spell so readily. But to be 
serious, they are birds of keen under- 
standing. How adroitly they man- 
age the business of migrating to sea- 
sonable spring and autumn homes. | 
read of a leader of a flock that piloted 
his followers dangerously near the 
earth. For this the birds deposed him 
and appointed a new guide. 

When wintering many years ago in 
Galveston I came upon some wooden 
decoy ducks in a neighbor’s basement. 
He was painting them in the greenish- 
blue and brown of a canvasback’s 
colors and was sparing no pains to 
make the birds look real, for hunted 
creatures must be sharp observers. 

When I saw mallards and teal and 
canvasbacks years later in Florida, 
some in the marshes, but more travel- 
ing heads downward to the table, 1 
remembered the wooden toys I had 
seen in the basement in Galveston. 

At night in the reeds of Florida 
one can hear the harsh dank squawk- 
ing of the water birds and think of 
how warily they have traveled down 
from the prospect of cold winters to 
gold suns and lagoon rushes. They 
knew just when to pick out a leader— 
a trusted gander—for the pilgrimage. 
And they knew when to start, per- 
haps a hundred in a group, just as 
squirrels in my back yard understand 
when their days of pilfering and romp- 
ing among the leaf-veiled trees must 
end for the prospect of winter. Tit- 
mice and chickadees hopping among 
the green trees in August seem to me 
always to be speculating as to how it 
will feel to dart about there when 
leaves and showy summer birds are 
gone and they and the juncos and 
downy woodpeckers are left to flutter 
about under winter skies. 


JACK O’LANTERN 
ACK O’LANTERN lived in a 
meadow beside a jolly old scare- 
crow who was dressed in russet and 
black. The scarecrow was taller than 
Jack O’Lantern but his head was only 
the top of a pole, so for all points of

Jack o'Lanrer 
and LKe... 


wisdom he found it necessary to con- 
sult Jack O’Lantern. 

Jack O’Lantern went to one of the 
village homes on Hallowe’en night and 
had a pleasant time smiling in a fixed 
way at a host of merry young folks. 
He had expected them after the party 
to return him to the old brown corn 
field where he had spent all his life 
with Ike, the scarecrow. 

But they failed to do this. He was 
never replaced in the corn field, but 
was taken by some one down into a 
mysterious region pronounced a “‘base- 
ment” and left there, he heard a 
round-faced woman in an apron pro- 
claim, “till Thanksgiving’. 

“What in the world does she 
mean?” Jack wondered. “And what 
in the world is Thanksgiving? I want 
to get back to the corn field and nestle 
at the foot of the nice rustling stack 
of fodder. This interior is terrible 
on a good healthy pumpkin. Is there 
any way out?” 


HERE were several ways cut. 

But Jack O’Lantern could not 
use any of them because in spite of 
his great thoughtful head he had no 
feet or legs. Ike the scarecrow was 
blessed with two legs girded with 
trousers, but he never went anywhere. 
He was there in the field now waiting, 
Jack O’Lantern knew, for some news 
of the young people’s party. 

“Of course,” thought Jack, “‘it 
really would have been worse for him 
than for me to leave the field. I was 
simply there growing fat, but he was 
tending the crops as well as keeping 
the crows from a crab apple tree near 
the fence. Such a pleasant fellow, in 


all weathers the same. There’s no 
companionship here in this horrible 
basement.” 

Jack O’Lantern turned his round 
head in search of an audience. There 
was‘ nothing but cold walls and some 
shelves of fruit. He had been placed 
so dangerously near the edge of a table 
that he could peer right through the 
thin curtains of the fruit cupboard 
and see the jars of glass glowing. 


AY on in the night he heard a 

little squeaking sound. “Those 

dreadful field mice,” he thought. But 

it was only a very tiny blackish mouse 

that hung round the walls of the cellar 
and lived near a cricket’s home. 

It went daintily under the fruit 
cabinet curtains perhaps to smell 
around for some spilt juice. Then 
carefully, carefully it slid up to where 
Jack sat. Two lights flashed. Some- 
thing soft brushed against Jack O’Lan- 
tern and smashed him to the cement 
floor. He was soon in pieces like 
Humpty Dumpty.: The big gray cat 
who caught the mouse did not realize 
that she had thrown Jack O’Lantern 
from his perch. And Ike the scare- 
crow never knew what had become of 
him. Thus were ended the fears and 
loneliness of Jack O’Lanterrf in cap- 
tivity.

Thread after thread, when done, 
So that the winter winds might blow

Yet it would keep the butterfly 
Warm as a pantry mouse.

Ee 


HREE legal struggles are now 
being waged by the National 
Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People in as many 
Northern States, over colored men 
whom Southern States are seeking to 
have returned to their jurisdiction for 
trial. The three cases are as follows: 
1. James Blevins, now in Wash- 
ington, D. C., wanted by Alabama. 

2. Edward Glass, now in Califor- 
nia, wanted by Oklahoma, 

3. Samuel Kennedy, now in In- 
diana, wanted by Georgia. 

In each case return of the colored 
man to the Southern State desiring 
jurisdiction is opposed by the Na- 
tional Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People, not only be- 
cause of unjust and discriminatory acts 
already committed against fugitive, but 
also because of the record of the case, 
and on the lynching and court record 
of the State desiring to recover juris- 
diction, there is the strongest prob- 
ability that the victim would be denied 
justice, if not murdered by a mob. 

At the present writing all three 
cases still await final disposition. They 
constitute such a raking indictment of 
the present processes of justice in 
Southern territory, that a summary of 
the facts alleged in court may perhaps 
be sufficient. Let us begin with the 
case of 

James Blevins Wanted in Alabama. 

Mr. Blevins was_a carpenter and 
paper-hanger, living with his wife, a 
daughter and a son in Birmingham. 
He is reputed to have been industrious 
and thrifty. He earned from ten to 
twelve dollars a day, saved his money, 
educated his children and bought a 
home, part of which he used for store- 
room and office purposes. 

Birmingham, like Alabama _ gener- 


_ ally, is Klan-ridden. To incur the 


enmity of the Ku Klux Klan, it is not 
necessary to be a criminal. In fact, a 
prosperous and law-abiding colored 
man is quite as likely to incur such 
enmity. In a case of recent record, a 
colored man was flogged to make him 
sell cheaply property that he had been 
unwilling to part with. 

Mr. Blevins incurred the enmity of 
elements which used the signature 
K. K. K. On June 1, 1926, on the 
letterhead of pne Robert E. Lee, an 
ungrammatical letter signed K. K. K. 
was sent Mr. Blevins, giving him 5 
days to finish jobs he had undertaken 
and quit town. Mr. Blevins appealed 
for aid to a member of the Bar of the 


November, 1927 








a> 


Southern Justice on Trial 
we > 





State of Alabama and on his advice 
Mr. Blevins showed the letter to the 
U. S. Post Office Inspector and the 
State’s Attorney. “Here,” says a brief 
submitted to the Court of Appeals of 
the District of Columbia, “was an 
appeal to the Federal and to the State 
governments, as well as to the lawyer, 
but it was an appeal made in vain.” 

Thereafter two white men called 
upon Mr. Blevins, demanded $100 and 
the deed to his home and on being 
refused opened fire on him. He re- 
plied with a single shot from a shot- 
gun. He was brutally beaten over 
the head with pistols, kicked and left 
unconscious. He was arrested and in- 
dicted. Not so his two white assail- 
ants. He was thereafter warned to 
leave and did in fact go from Birming- 
ham to Washington, D. C. “It is to 
be observed,” continues the brief, “that 
the only persons whose names are en- 
dorsed on the back of the indictment 
as witnesses against appellant are the 
Dorrough brothers. Why were the 
two assailants summoned to appear 
before the grand jury, when it is cus- 
tomary in such cases to summon only 
one? Was it the purpose to exempt 
both from prosecution as they would 
thereby become, under the Alabama 
system of jurisprudence, for any of- 
fense as to which they had testified?” 

A letter written by one J. Reese 
Murray, Attorney-at-Law, in Bir- 
mingham, to Mr. Blevins, is also sig- 
nificant. The letter, dated November 
22, 1926, is as follows: 

“James, your case is set for December 
14th. I understand that you have left 
town which I think is very foolish, for 
this reason: one of the boys is out of the 
State at College studying medicine, and 
it will be practically impossible for him 
to return. I have already discussed the 
matter with both of them and they are 
willing to reduce the case to misdemean- 
or, and let you go taking a small fine, 
like I tried to get Judge Abernethy to 
agree to do, provided you will pay up 
what you owe them which is something 
over $100. Now if you want to arrange 
it this way, and that is by far the best 
way, you can do so. On the other hand 
if you don’t want to do that, then it is 
up to me to look you up and have you 
brought back, and then of course, I 
would not be willing to help you. Now, 
of course, looking you up I can do, with- 
out much trouble, as I was not with the 


Ste 


Government for 15 years for nothing. 

“If you are brought back it will go 
mighty hard with you, on the other hand 
if you will do like I said in the beginning 
we can dispose of the case with very lit- 
tle cost, and clear your name forever. 
So be guided by what you think is best. 
If you stay away you will be taking a 
chance with me and with Uncle Sam.” 
This letter is signed “J. Reese Mur- 
ray, by L. M.” 

The case of Mr. Blevins came to 
Neval H. Thomas, President of the 
Washington, D. C. Branch of the N. 
A. A. C. P. who referred Mr. Blevins 
to the Branch’s attorney, Mr. Syl- 
vester L. McLaurin. Mr. McLaurin 
associated with himself in the case, 
Professor William H. Richards. The 
attorneys instituted habeas corpus pro- 
ceedings and had the extradition writ 
quashed and Blevins was released. 
Within twenty minutes he was rear- 
rested and another writ of habeas cor- 
pus obtained from another branch of 
the Supreme Court in the District of 
Columbia, from whose ruling appeal 
has now been taken to the District of 
Columbia Court of Appeals, where ar- 
gument is to be had soon. 


In the appeal brief, the validity of 
the extradition warrant is denied on 
the following grounds: 


“Because said indictment is illegal and 
invalid in this, that it does not set forth 
the date on which the alleged crime was 
committed ; 

“Because the said indictment was found 
by a grand jury composed of white men 
only, Negroes being unjustly excluded 
therefrom though qualified to serve there- 
on, designedly, systematically, and as part 
of the racial policy of the State of Ala- 
bama, contrary to law, and to the preju- 
dice of the petitioner, who is a person of 
color; 

“Because said indictment does not, as 
required ‘by law, set out an extraditable 
offence ; ‘ 

“Because the State of Alabama and its 
courts are so dominated by the Ku Klux 
Klan that a Negro who has been indicted 
in the State for assault upon a white man 
is denied a fair and impartial trial and 
to deliver your petitioner to the State of 
Alabama is to deny him due process of 
law and the equal protection of the laws.” 


It would be difficult to find a more 
stinging indictment of a State, its gov- 
ernment and its administration of jus- 
tice than this. A close second will be 
found in the case of 
Edward Glass Wanted in Oklahoma. 


Edward Glass, about 40 years old, 
living in Sapulpa, Oklahoma, owner

of a hotel, cafe and undertaking es- 
tablishment and a number of houses 
which he rented out, became in virtue 
of his position and his means, a factor 
in local politics. Among his opponents 
was the local Chief of Police, Morey 
by name. Mr. Morey is quoted as 
saying that “if my faction wins the 
town will be too small for that ‘nigger’ 
and myself”. 

Morey’s faction did win and a se- 
ries of raids were undertaken against 
Glass’ place of business. They be- 
came so offensive that Glass applied 
to a white lawyer for an injunction 
to prevent the Police Department from 
making further such raids. The case 
Was to come up in court on January 
3, 1923. The police chief informed 
cf it, is reported on the night of Janu- 
ary 2, to have gone with, or sent, four 
non-uniformed men to raid Glass’ 
place. Glass had closed and had 
turned out his lights when he heard 
someone trying to force his front door 
and saw three or four men with drawn 
revolvers.. Prior to this time his place 
had been held up twice. He dropped 
behind his counter and began to crawl 
toward the rear of his store. Pass- 
ing under his burglar light, he was 
fired upon, being wounded. He got 
to his revolver and returned the fire 
in the direction from which it had 
come. He was wounded three times, 
his gun being shot from his hand. He 
escaped from the town into the hills 
and learned next day that he had killed 
a man and wounded two others. He 
reached Oakland, California, finally 
and was there conducting a small res- 
taurant business when extradition pro- 
ceedings were begun. In the mean- 
time, his hotel and undertaking parlor 
were burned to the ground in Salpulpa, 
no one being punished for the outrage, 
and a man named Ragsdale, accused 
of having assisted Glass to escape, was 
shot to death while handcuffed, on the 
alleged ground that he was “trying to 
escape”. Glass was arrested in Oak- 
land, California on August 31, 1927. 

When extradition papers reached 
Governor C. C. Young of California, 
the Northern California Branch of the 
N. A. A. C. P. at once rallied for de- 
fense. Appeals were made to the 
Governor not to sign the extradition 
warrant on the ground that Glass 
would not be given a fair trial if re- 
turned to Oklahoma and that he 
would, in fact, be lynched as soon as 
he reached the State. The National 
Office forwarded to the Branch statis- 
tics embodied in a sworn statement by 
the Secretary, showing that since 1889, 
there had been recorded 89 lynchings 
in the State of Oklahoma, most of 
them unpunished. 

The Governor signed the warrant 
of rendition but exacted a promise from 
the local District Attorney, of Ala- 
meda County, California, that the de- 


302 


fendant be accorded full opportunity 
to present his case before California 
Courts. And a writ of habeas corpus 
was obtained. At latest reports the 
writ was filed in the Federal Court 
where it was to be argued on Septem- 
ber 26, the defense seeking to prove 
that return to Oklahoma would mean 
either death to Glass before his trial 
or a trial so influenced by mob spirit 
and mob threats that it would be a vio- 
lation of his Constitutional rights. 

The third of the extradition cases 
that came to a focus in te month of 
September, 1927, originated in Geor- 
gia, a state well known for its lynch- 
ing record. The case involved a dra- 
matic series of attempts by a Georgia 
Sheriff to remove his prisoner by au- 
tomobile and train, beginning in IIli- 
nois and coming to a temporary halt 
in Indiana, where the case was brought 
before the courts by the N. A. A. C. 
P. The case is that of 
Samuel Kennedy Wanted in Georgia. 

Extraditions to Georgia have been 
denied before this, by Northern Gov- 
ernors, at the instance of the N. A. 
A. C. P., because of Georgia’s lynch- 
ing record and the absence of any as- 
surance that a fair trial would be given 
a colored man if returned there. 
Samuel Kennedy, charged with having 
“slapped” a white man in Georgia, 
and with having escaped after a chain 
gang sentence of 18 months had been 
imposed upon him for the crime, was 
found by a Georgia Sheriff in Chicago, 
where he was taken in custody. The 
colored man denied ever having lived 
in Georgia, declared he knew nothing 
of the crime attributed to him and af- 
firmed that he could furnish an un- 
assailable alibi as to his whereabouts 
at the time the alleged “slapping” took 
place. 

After a hard fight by the N, A. A. 
C. P. Branch in Chicago, the colored 
man was remanded to the care of the 
Georgia Sheriff, who at once left, se- 
cretly by automobile but, missing con- 
nections with his train at Terre Haute, 
[ndiana, temporarily turned his pris- 
oner over to the local sheriff, for the 
night, thereby losing custody. This 
slip was taken advantage of by the 
Terre Haute N. A. A. C. P. whose 


attorney obtained a writ which de- 


tained the Georgia Sheriff longer than 


he had anticipated. 3 
Two attorneys, Harold M. Tyler 
of Chicago and R. L. Bailey of Indian- 
apolis took the case with the express 
intention of carrying it before the State 
Supreme Court in Indiana, if neces- 
sary. The Circuit Court at Terre 
Haute has taken jurisdiction, and after 
a struggle granted a continuation un- 
til October 5. The Georgia Sheriff 
had an automobile bearing a Georgia 
license, ready to carry Kennedy to the 
South where they “understand” the 


Negro. But he was forced once more 


to wait upon the action of a Northern 
Court of law. 

A recital of the bare facts in the 
above three cases, will show conclu- 
sively that the N. A. A. C. P. is not 
desirous of preventing the bringing of 
criminals to trial. But it will exert 
its utmost efforts to prevent the return 
of any colored man accused of crime 
to a community guilty of offenses 
against him, where the record of law- 
lessness and the present temper is such 
that it is virtually certain a fair trial, 
if not any trial at all, would be denied 
at the behest of a mob. 

What is on trial in these cases is 
not the unfortunate colored man, but 
the fabric of Southern justice and the 
civilization which in one State sub- 
jects law to the dictation of hooded 
gangs of cowardly floggers and thugs, 
in two other States, makes lynching 
or trial in a court dominated by a po- 
tential lynching mob almost a cer- 
tainty. It is on the issue of Southern 
justice and its administration to the 
Negro, excluded almost  uriversally 
from jury service, that the N. A. A. 
C. P. is fighting the extradition cases, 
some of which it has won in the past, 
three of which it has had to under- 
take in the month of September. 


H. J. S. 
400 BRANCHES OR 1,000? 


To increase its effectiveness and to 
widen its field of action, the Associa- 
tion has embarked on a campaign to 
increase the present number of its 
Branches from 400 (of which some 
are inactive) to 1,000, all of them ac- 
tive, all of them vigilant in behalf of 
those rights and privileges which alone 
constitute and safeguard the United 
States ‘titizenship of the American 
Negro. 

In the year 1928, the N. A. A. C. 
P. wants to increase the number of its 
active Branches to 1,000. Many 
places in the North with considerable 
Negro populations are now without a 
Branch of the N. A. A. C. P. In 
those very places some case is more 
than likely to arise, jeopardizing the 
property or even the life of a Negro 
and the citizenship of all Negroes. 
Numerous communities in the South, 
well able to organize and maintain a 
Branch of the N. A. A. C. P. are 
without one. In those communities, 
both North and South, the status of 
every Negro will be assured, and de- 
fense be made easier by the organiza- 
tion of a Branch. 

The National Office therefore asks 
that the members of every existing 
Branch Executive Committee, desig- 
nate a Committee to organize new 
Branches in nearby places. Names and 
addresses of these Committees when 
chosen should be sent to the National 
Office without delay.

To Those Dead and Gone 
By ALLISON DAVIS 


IE broken in the dark, cool loam 
You still enrich, not with your force 
now, 
But with your peace. You are a home 
Where I return for wisdom, how 


To know my own dark roots and this 
Day’s newer race, a mute, mysterious 
Past, whose shrouded sorrow is 

A sign the fates have set us. 


Nor are you as a past we scorn; 

No mock was yours to us unknown. 

We who to daily shame are born 

Learn from you in whom our seed is 
sown. 


But tragedy is more than token; 
Here life and beauty lie frustrate, 
As lie unnumbered broken 

Races in the soil of every state. 


The Sun of Brittainy 
Translated from the French 
By JESSIE FAUSET 


I 
“er HE sea compels me; sister I must 


Nay! Do not hold me,—I’m of age you 
know! 

I am a Breton and of noble birth. 

The pathway of the ocean draws me so!” 


“But, brother, if you leave, what good 
am I on earth? 

Without you, dear, my life is poor and 
cold. 

Ah! stir not from our fold! 

Remain with me until we both are old! 

Our mountain life is happy, brother dear. 

And then in Brittainy the sunlight is so 
clear!”

“Upon a vessel which shall bear your 
name 

A captain I’ll return, but still the same. 

Within three years we'll own these 
woods, this land; 

And lords of all we'll be, and all will 


claim.” 


“But think,” said she, “what more can 
you demand? 

Our cottage rises from the earth’s brown 
mold, 

And happy, happy is our humble fold. 


Remain with me until we both are old! ° 


Our mountain life is happy, brother dear, 
And then in Brittainy the sunlight is so

Annie and Madalene Stone, St. Louis, Mo. 


Ten lonely years—no word from him no 
call! 

Beside the hearth his sister, his best 
friend, 

Wept, constant, wearing sorrow as a pall. 

Then suddenly her grief comes to an end. 

One day a sailor, shipwrecked, racked 
with cold, 

Sought shelter. 

“You! My brother, grown so old 

“Yes, sister mine, I’ve come back to the 
fold. 

This mountain life will heal my suffering 
drear. 

And sweetest Brittainy, thy sunlight is so 
clear!”

Covered thick with icy flakin’,

Start appearin’ on the scene; 
When you smell the scent 0’ spices 
An’ o’ canned fruit cut in slices

Can you guess what it may mean? 


When you see your Ma’s 2-bastin’

Don’t you kinda feel like kneelin’, 
Givin’ thanks—Thanksgivin’s here? 


Sunset 
By GLADYS MITCHELL 


] SAW the fingers of the West 
Caress the sky last night. 
They pressed it very tenderly, 
Then disappeared from sight. 
And into every shallow groove 
Their finger prints had made, 

I watched the golden glowing light 
Of evening, sink and fade. 


Winter for Rememberance 


By DOROTHY KRUGER 


HEN winter touched her hair 
And cooled desire, 

She often rested where 

A friendly fire 

Could warm her chair; 


And held the crystal flowers 
And drops of jade, 

And reeling ivory towers 
Remembrance made 


Of brimful hours, 


And set them in the wide 

Red cabinet 

Where once she thought to hide 
A young kiss wet 

With tears inside. 


And then, though winter’s trace 
Was on desire, 

Her eyes would melt frost lace 
And shadow fire 

Dance on her face. 


Montmartre Beggar Woman 
By LANGSTON HUGHES 


NCE you were beautiful,— 
Now, 

Hunched in the cold, 

Nobody cares 

That you are old. 


Once you’ were 
Now, 

In the street, 

No one remembers 
Your lips were sweet. 


lovely, — 


Oh, withered old woman 
Of rue Fontaine 

Nobody but Death 

Will kiss you again.

SOCIAL PROGRESS 


@ The Louisville Public Library re- 
ports for the fiscal year ending August 
31, that there are eighty-five centers 
for the circulation of books to Negroes 
in Louisville and Jefferson counties. 
There are 26,009 volumes in the de- 
partment, an increase of 396 books 
during the year. The circulation of 
books was 142,726, an increase of 15,- 
160. 

@ The Frederick Douglass Memorial 
Hospital and Training School at 
Philadelphia, Pa., is constructing a 
Nurses’ Dormitory, which, when com- 
pleted will cost $73,000. When the 
nurses move into their new quarters 
the hospital proper will have a 100 
bed capacity. 

@ A prize competition has been an- 
nounced under the auspices of the 
Lawyers Club of the University of 
Michigan. Two prizes, one $500 and 
the other $250 are offered for the best 
essays on “American Institutions”. 
Inquiries for information regarding 
this competition should be addressed 
to Professor Grover C. Grismore, Sec- 
retary, Board of Governors of the 
Lawyers’ Club of the University of 
Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. 


@ The Supreme Court of Georgia re- 
cently declared the Atlanta “barber 
bill”, prohibiting Negro barbers from 
cutting the hair of white children un- 
der fourteen years of age, contrary to 
the constitutions of both the state and 
nation. 


@ The 


“History of the 25th In- 
fantry’, the famous Negro Regiment, 


was published recently. It attempts 
to record the achievements of the regi- 
ment after the Civil War on the 
American Frontier; at San Juan Hill; 
and the Philippines. 

@ Thirty-six percent of the popula- 
tion of Norfolk, Va., is colored. The 
principal occupations in which this 
population is engaged are the build- 
ing trades, loading and unloading ship 
cargoes, coal trimmers, lumber yard 
work, tobacco stemming, etc. There 
are thirteen colored schools with an 
attendance of over 7,000; sixty-eight 
colored churches; and a bank with a 
paid up capital of $110,000, deposits 
of $568,402 and total assets of $713,- 
084.

PORTO RICO 


@ America’s first School of Tropical 
Medicine at San Juan, Porto Rico, has 
completed its first year and the first 
person to receive a certificate from the 
institution is Dr. Gurbax Singh Sant 
of Amritsar, India. Dr. Sant was the 
first student to enroll when the school 
opened last year. 


EAST AFRICA 


@ A “White Paper” has been issued 
by the British Government outlining 
the policy in East Africa. It recom- 
mends federation and changes in the 
power of legislative councils so as to 
associate immigrants and “ultimately 
natives in the work of government”. 
Also a “complementary” political de- 
velopment of native and non-native. 
It reports that in Kenya “the interest 
of African natives must be para- 
inount”. This document was drawn 
ur four years ago. 


ABYSSINIA 
@ The Abyssinian government, un- 
der His Highness, Ras Taffari Ma- 
konnen, is considering the proposed 
construction of a dam by the British 
at the outlet of Lake Tsana. 
BELGIAN CONGO 


@ The native population of the Bel- 
gian Congo was recently reported to 


be 7,692,573. This estimate relates 


November, 1927 





only to those natives who 
reported to the census of- 
ficials. 


GOLD COAST 
@ During the past twen- 
ty-five years the revenue 
of the Gold Coast has 
risen from £333,283 to 
£4,365,320. The two 
chief causes of this rapid 
progress are cocoa and 
trade communications. In 
1881, 80 pounds of cocoa 
were exported; in 1910, 
10,000 pounds; and in 
1926, 231,000 pounds. 


Miss F. B. Grimes, page 305 


In 1900 thére was no harbor and only 
a few miles of railway and motor road. 
By 1919 there were two boat harbors; 
492 miles of railway; and 4,680 miles 
of motor road. 

@ Chief Amoah III of the Gold 
Coast descends from one of the oldest 
of the royal families of West Africa. 
He traces his decent with document- 
ary evidence back to the thirteenth 
century. But Chief Amoah is a thor- 
oughly modern man and is interested 
in the economic emancipation of the 
black cocoa growers of the Gold Coast. 
He has tried to get banking and credit 
facilities in England and for some 
time lately, has been in close consulta- 
tion with the leading bankers of New 
York City. It is said that an Amer- 
ican branch bank may soon be estab- 
lished in West Africa. Chief Amoah 
III took a: prominent part in the sec- 
ond and fourth Pan African con- 
gresses. 

@ The Gold Coast Railway is now 
operating on 492 miles and has cost 
over $40,000,000. The gross receipts 
are over $5,000,000 annually and 
1,500,000 passengers are carried to- 
gether with 805,000 tons of goods. 
Natives are the workmen, foremen and 
largely the engineers, mechanics and 
clerks. 


SIERRA LEONE 


@ The question of slavery in Sierra 








Leone is claiming the attention of the 
British Government. A recent deci- 
sion of the Sierra Leone Supreme 
Court claims that slave owners have 
legal rights in the recapture of their 
runaway slaves. When the Protec- 
torate came under British supervision, 
an ordinance was passed to the effect 
that no child should be born in slavery 
and that on the death of an owner, all 
his slaves should become free. 

@ An official report on the trade con- 
dition of Sierra Leone during 1926 
states that imports amounted to £1,- 
844,122 against £2,178,461 in 1925. 
Exports amounted to £1,871,446 in 
1926 and £1,820,635 in 1925. 


RHODESIA 


@ Mr. Howard Moffat has been ap- 
pointed Premier and Minister of Na- 
tive Affairs in Rhodesia. Mr. Moffat 
was born in 1869. He entered politics 
in 1914 as Minister of Mines and 
Works. 


SOUTH AFRICA 


@ Dr. Molema, a native of the Baro- 
long Tribe of South Africa, is a medi- 
cal graduate of Edinburgh and has the 
only X-ray machine at Mafeking. He 
is married to a Barolong girl, formerly 
a school teacher of splendid ability. 
Dr. Molema, as we mentioned in the 
July Crisis, is having trouble because 
he has so many white patients. White 
nurses at the hospital struck against 
him but were compelled to return. 
The Union of South Africa is now 
considering a law to keep Negroes 
from treating white patien‘s! 


NIGERIA 


@ There has been little change in the 
status of official education in Nigeria 
during 1926. ‘The training college at 
Katsina graduated fourteen students 
with second and third class certifi- 
cates. There were fifteen primary, 
forty-seven elementary and six schools 
for art and crafts in 1926. This is 
an increase over 1925 when there were 
fifteen elementary schools. 


ITALY 


@ President King of Liberia was the 
recipient of many courtesies during 
his visit to Rome. He was the guest 
of the Government at the Hotel Ex- 
celsior; Sr. Grandi, of the Foreign 
Office, entertained him at a banquet 
attended by high officials of the State; 
he visited the tombs of the late King 
Victor Emmanuel III, Umberto I, 
Margherita and Italy’s Unknown Sol- 
dier at the Pantheon; and he visited 
the Vatican where he was received 
with honors in the Court of San Da- 
maso by the Papal Chamberlain, Mgr. 
Caccia Dominioni and the Marquis 
Sacripante and was led to the Pope’s 
private library where the Pope re- 
ceived him.

THE BROWSING READER 


AMES WELDON JOHNSON’S 

“Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured 
Man”, which first appeared in 1912, 
has been republished by Knopf, with 
an introduction by Carl Van Vechten. 
Mr. Van Vechten says: “The Auto- 
biography, of course, in the matter of 
specific incident, has little enough to 
do with Mr. Johnson’s own life, but 
it is imbued with his own personality 
and feeling, his views of the subjects 
discussed, so that to a person who has 
no previous knowledge of the author’s 


own history, it reads like real auto- 


biography. It would be truer, per- 
haps, to say that it reads like a com- 
posite autobiography of the Negro race 
in the United States in modern times’. 
The book is beautifully bound and 
printed. 

“In Spite of Handicaps” by Ralph 
W. Bullock (Association Press, New 
York), is a series of “brief biographies 
of Negroes who, in spite of the inevit- 
able limitations they must face, are 
achieving distinction in business, the 
professions, and art”. Among the 
persons mentioned are Roland Hayes, 
Mordecai W. Johnson, Robert Russa 
Moton, Countée Cullen, Harry T. 
Burleigh, George W. Carver, John 
Hope, Henry O. Tanner and others. 
All of the biographies are short and 
there are questionnaires and a bibliog- 
raphy. The little book should be popu- 
lar in homes and schools. 


Wendell P. Dabney has written and 
issued from his own publishing com- 
pany a little biography of Maggie L. 
Walker, the president of the St. Luke’s 
Bank in Richmond, Virginia, and 
Grand Secretary of the Independent 
Order of St. Luke. The book is a 
collection of tributes to a remarkable 
woman, with a brief biographical 
sketch. It quotes the great word of 
the Governor of Virginia: “If the 
State of Virginia had done no more in 
fifty years with the funds spent on the 
education of the Negroes, than educate 
Mrs. Walker, the State would have 
been amply repaid for its outlay and 
efforts”. The book should have wide 
reading. 


Countée Cullen’s “Copper Sun’ is

“IT am no longer lame since Spring 

Stooped to me where I lay, 

And charmed with flute and silver lute 

My laggard limbs to play. 

Her voice is sweet as long-stored wine; 

I leap like a hounded fawn;

E have received three studies of 

Negro life: Abram L. Harris’s

Niles Carpenter’s “Nationality, Color

In Minneapolis one sees a great in- 
crease in the ownership of homes and 


seme industrial opportunity. In Buf- 


falo, out of twenty-eight trade unions 
covering kinds of work in which Ne- 
groes were employed, twelve certainly 
excluded Negroes and many others 
probably did. Among the conclusions 
are that the Negro has proven himself 
capable of holding employment over a 


fairly long period of time; that his. 


economic status is improved by educa- 
tion; that he does not pay disportionate 
rent although he is partially segregated ; 
that marital conditions were normal 
and housing conditions not bad. In 
work, however, the Negro was pretty 
narrowly limited to unskilled and 
menial labor and personal service

The letters show what the advocates of 
the new interracial reconstruction in 
the South have dared to say since 1912. 
They take up lynching, education, mi- 
gration, interracial co-operation and 
law enforcement. The central spirit 
is perhaps this sentence: “It is my firm 
belief that it is entirely possible for the 
two races in the South to live together 
harmoniously on terms of co-operation 
and friendship with a satisfactory ad- 
justment of the differences on both 
sides”.

IN THE MAGAZINES 

O much has been written to cover 

up the shrewd exploitation of 
African labor, that it was with a dis- 
tinct feeling of pleasure that we read 
“Achimota: An Experiment in Edu- 
cation” in Landmark for August. 
Achimota, a co-educational institution 
situated on the Gold Coast, Africa, 
is not quite a year old and it already 
has an encouraging enrollment in the 
lower grades. The aim of the uni- 
versity is to teach Africans the essen- 
tials of leadership. We will watch 
the Achimota experiment with extreme 
interest. 

Perhaps the most unprejudiced ar- 
ticle we have found within the year 
on “The Struggle in Africa” is writ- 
ten by Raymond L. Buell in Foreign 
Affairs for October. Natives have 
been obliged to adjust themselves in 
‘he small space of twenty-five years 
to the petty devices of an industrial 
civilization. In conclusion Mr. Buell 
says: “It will be futile if the white 
governments attempt to stamp out the 
Negro’s aspirations. The intelligent 
governments of Africa today are at- 
tempting to train their populations so 
that eventually . . . they might be 
able to govern themselves”.

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE 


E quote from the Memphis, 
Tenn., Every Appeal: 

No Negro policemen, no Negro fire- 
mien and no general admission of Ne- 
groes to Overton Park. 

That was the answer of Mayor Row- 
lett Paine today to the demands of the 
West Tennessee Civic and Political 
League, a Negro political organization. 


The Mayor’s complete statement 
follows: 


The West Tennessee Civic and Politi- 
cal League, a Negro political organiza- 
tion, has publicly announced that it in- 
tends to ask for the appointment of 
Negro policemen, Negro firemen and 
the general admission of Negroes into 
Overton Park, including the zoo, at all 
times. 

I deeply deplore the political activities 
that led to the formation of a Negro or- 
ganization that voices such demands at 
the beginning of the municipal campaign. 
The politicians who herded the Negroes 
and voted them in droves in the state 
Democratic primary last year paved the 
way for the situation now contronting the 
people of Memphis and constituting the 
greatest menace to white supremacy in 
this city since reconstruction days. 

The evils of the situation have been 
aggravated by the recent appeals for 
racial solidarity and political mass action 
by the Negroes. 

There are many intelligent, law-abid- 
ing Negroes in Memphis, and there is 
nothing to fear from the votes of this 
class, nor is there any impropriety in 
candidates for office making any legiti- 
mate appeal for the support of a Negro 
who votes his own convictions. 

It is a vastly different situation, how- 
ever, when a Negro political club has 
been organized with the thought that it 
can dominate the politics of the city of 
Memphis, and no white man whose polit- 
ical morality is above the level of the 
carpetbagger, will give aid and comfort 
tc a political organization of Negroes 
that has as its principal object the con- 
trol of city elections with the solid Negro 
vote. 

There is no use in mincing words about 
the matter, and my answer to the de- 
mands of this Negro political league is the 
direct and positive statement that there 
will be no Negro policemen, no Negro 
firemen, nor removal of the restrictions 
now governing the admission of Negroes 
to the white parks of the city, including 
the Overton Park zoo, as long as I have 


any voice in the control of the city gov- 
ernment. 


HAPPY INDIANAPOLIS 
COLUMNIST" in the Indian- 


apolis Star has her say after the 


November, 1927 








THE FAR HORIZON 


annual conference of the N. A. A. 
CoP.: 

Reading the utterances of many speak- 
ers . . . lately in Indianapolis it 
sounded as if both white and Negro ora- 
tors had dedicated themselves to keeping 
alive the flames of resentment and race 
hatred. One of these, evidently so dedi- 
cated, sent from afar to “investigate” us 
told me an amazing tale of our Negroes 
“being barred from living in decent parts 
of the city, trading in decent shops, en- 
joying good films and so on and so on”. 
I asked her if she had gone out North 
Senate, Capitol and Northwestern ave- 


-nues, or out in the northwestern part to 


see the attractive homes there, the fine 
new school buildings, the prosperous 
churches, the movie houses showing the 
same films, though a bit later, that are 
shown in all film theaters, the beautiful 
park where these families may enjoy 
themselves undisturbed by others. No, 
she hadn’t seen any of this, she had got- 
ten all her information from Miss X, 
herself a comparative stranger in Indian- 
apolis. It is this kind of exaggeration 
based upon complete ignorance of the 
truth which breeds and keeps alive race 
hatred. 


To this M. Sawyer replies: 

I never fail to read and enjoy “Giving 
Woman Her Say”, but this morning 
reading one particular paragraph in this 
article, the thought is brought out that 
the Negroes at their conventions are too 
often complaining of the hardships im- 
posed upon them. I wonder if it has been 
given a thought that if we stood by pas- 
sively whether we would have the few 
things we are allowed in this beautiful 
city? 

She called attention to Capitol and 
Senate avenues and the northwestern 
part of the city; I wonder if she has kept 
up with the bombing of the homes in this 
part of the city, the constant fight that 
has to go on, the law suits that have been 
brought to bear to enable us to have 
beautiful homes? 

I do not agitate neither do I feel that 
every little discrimination should be 
aired but I do say, that if it were not 
for these conventions, where it is pos- 
sible to make known the embarrassing 
things we have to stand, that we would 
not be able to have beautiful homes, 
schools, parks, etc., that our no mean 
city affords us. 


A white lady adds: 


Unlike M. Sawyer, I do not read 
“Giving Woman Her Say”, since the 
writer’s attitude seldom appeals to me and 
so I missed her remarks to the effect that 
colored people in their conventions were 
too much given to complaining of the 
hardships imposed on them, 

I wish those of us who feel that way 
could suddenly assume the appearance 








and automatically, of course, the handi- 
caps of a colored person for, say, one 
week. I imagine one would acquire some 
little education in that length of time. I 
believe that we of the white race owe 
more than we know to the fact that 
Negroes as a race are long suffering and 
patient and by nature courteous. 
GERTRUDE DEMUNBRUN. 


NEGRO BANKS 


That the first depositor in the first 
savings bank in the United States was a 
Negro is one of the interesting facts 
brought out in an article in the “Savings 
Bank Journal”, of September, 1927, just 
published in New York City. Curtis 
Roberts, who was a servant in the home 
of Condy Raguet, who was one of the 
founders of the Philadelphia Saving Fund 
Society, is the man whose first silver dol- 
lar started that society on the road to de- 
posits of more than $200,000,000. 


Other interesting bits of history con- 
nected with the banking business among 
Negroes in America, beginning with the 
establishment in 1865 of the Freedmen’s 
Savings Bank and Trust Company down 
to the latest attempt to organize a Na- 
tional Bank in Harlem, are interestingly 
related in an article on page fifty-six of 
the “Savings Bank Journal”, written by 
Harry H. Pace, President of the North- 
eastern Life Insurance Company. 

The article was written at the request 
of Mr. Frederick O. Shubert, Editor of 
this magazine, who read Mr. Pace’s 
article on banking in the January Crisis. 
In acknowledging receipt ‘of the finished 
article, Mr. Shubert wrote: “It is the 
most interesting article on this subject 
that I have ever read”. 

Mr. Pace closes with a plea to the 
powers that be in the banking world for 
a larger opportunity for bank training for 
young Negroes who are coming out of 
the universities and colleges of the coun- 
try and who desire to enter the banking 
business. 

The closing paragraph of the article 
which has caused wide comment in bank- 
ing circles is as follows: 

“There is a question involved which 
the banking business of the country would 
do well to ponder. If the banking busi- 
ness is to be kept as it should be, a safe 
business managed by men who understand 
what they are doing, and whose lives are 
above reproach, the opportunity to learn 
the business ought to be given to those 
who enter it. Despite all regulations and 
laws, some Negroes somewhere are going 
to enter the banking business and they 
are going to enter it in greater numbers 
in many communities; whether they have 
experience or whether they go into it as 
some have done without knowledge of 
what it means. Young men who are com- 
ing out of universities and colleges ought 


309 





to be given a chance to study the banking 
business and to take back to their own 
people the true meaning of thrift and sav- 
ing, the backbone of the finance of a na- 
tion.” 


A CONGRESS OF MISSIONS 
FIFTH CONGRESS on mis- 


sions has been held at Louvain, 
Belgium. 


The “Cinquiéme Semaine de Missio- 
logie de Louvain” (August 10th to 14th) 
was even more impressive, according to 
the testimony of the 400 congressists than 
the preceding ones. 


Missiologists of the first order, such 
as Ir. Charles, Dr. Schmidlin and Dr. 
Aufhauser, professors respectively of 
Louvain, Munster and Munchen, and 
Munchen, and missionaries of recognized 
experience such as Mgr. Robichez, bishop 
of Trincomaly, the V. R. Fr. Rutten, 
sup. gen. of Scheut, the V. R. Fr. Guil- 
cher, sup. gen. of the Missions africaines 
de Lyon, showed in a series of some 20 
reports the necessity of forming an elite 
in every domain of missionary endeavor. 
In other words they gave an exposé of 
what has been already accomplished as 
well as what they hope to do for the 
native clergy, for the founding of Catho- 
lic universities in missionary countries, for 
the promoting of pious associations and 
social works among the Christians who 
depend on the Propaganda. 

Interesting discussions followed these 
reports and the exchange of views were 
all the more interesting from the fact 
that those taking part belonged to 22 
different nations, represented 36 mis- 
sionary congregations and came from 
every part of -the world: China, India, 
Ceylon, Madagascar, Rhodesia, Poly- 
nesia, etc. 


These exhanges of views led the mis- 
sionaries to treat upon all the great 
colonial questions: the color-bar, the re- 
spect of native customs, the development 
of nationalism in missionary fields, etc. If 
at times, in the heat of discussion, prin- 
ciples somewhat rigid were enunciated by 
the theorists they were soon enlightened 
by those who had practical experience 
upon the subjects in question. 

The point that was particularly 
stressed in these friendly debates, was 
that the Negro of Africa is capable of 
every possible development. According 
to missionaries who have worked long 
years among them, they show the greatest 
possibilities of religious, intellectual 
moral, esthetical and social development, 
and are in no way radically inferior to 
the peoples of other races. The conclu- 
sion of the discussion upon the Negro 
question was to confirm the idea that the 
black race can legitimately attain to the 
highest destinies. But it is necessary for 
us missionaries to show him the way, to 
educate him, to go to school as it were, 
to him, to study him thoroughly, his 
language and his culture. 


The English Review of Missions has 
a naive article on “Church and. State 
in Uganda”. 


310 


The question of the relations between 
Church and State in Uganda is compli- 
cated by the different senses in which 
each of these words may be used. The 
Church, that is organized Christianity, is 
represented at one time by the Mission, 
at another by the local or native Church. 
The State, that is constituted authority, 
is embodied at one time in the native 
Government, at another in the British 
Administration. It is not always pos- 
sible, even in thought, to disentangle the 
two. Mission and native Church go hand 
in hand, native and European Govern- 
ments are bound up together. 


The question is further complicated 
by the fact that two widely different 
types of mission exist side by side: the 
Anglican, represented by the Church 
Missionary Society, and (in the West 
Nile district) by the Church of Eng- 
land section of the Africa Inland Mis- 
sion, and the Roman, represented by the 
White Fathers (French) and the Mill 
Hill Mission (English), and in the far 
north by the Italian Mission. 


The native Government to-day is not 
one but many, and of many varying 
types, ranging from a monarchy, as de- 
veloped in Buganda, to a_ primitive 
patriarchal government. Broadly speak- 
ing the districts west of the Nile are or- 
ganized on a monarchical, those on the 
east on a patriarchal basis. Busgoga is 
an example of a country which has 
emerged from the one, without having 
developed into the other. 


Over the whole varied system of na- 
tive government — patriarchal, tribal, 
monarchical—has been superimposed the 
framework of British administration. 
The Protectorate is divided into five pro- 
vinces, and these again into districts. 
Whatever the previously existing stage 
of development the same general prin- 
ciples of administration are followed. 
The country is divided into counties or 
sazas, each under its own county or saza 
chief, and these counties into sub-dis- 
tricts. Each chief presides over his own 
county or district court, and through 
these chiefs and their courts the British 
Government, by what is called indirect 
rule, administers the country. 


MISCELLANEOUS 


6¢]— WISH I could share your illusion 

that Christ, or Christianity at any 
stage of its history, was pacifist. For the 
voice that said, ‘All they that take the 
sword shall perish with the sword’, also 
said: ‘Think not that I am come to send 
peace on earth; I came not to send peace, 
but asword.’ And we know now that the 
angels at his birth never sang (as for- 
merly mistranslated) ‘on earth peace, 
good will to men’, but the un-pacifist 
song, ‘on earth peace to men of good 
will’ (as the Catholic version has al- 
ways run) or ‘peace on earth for men 
whom he favors” (as the great Protes- 
tant scholar Moffat translates it)—for 
the men not of good will, for the men 
whom he did not favor, he came with a 
sword! Alas, like all characters in his- 
tory, his is too complicated to sum up 
in a single modern word like pacifist, even 


though he loved his enemies and turned 
his other cheek—some times!”

Slowly but surely the ‘Millstones” 
of the Universe are grinding out the 
“Colour problem”’. 

It is a burden of vast responsibility 
to be shouldered by the minority white 
races, against the prodigous masses of 
coloured nations. 

To ensure success it is necessary to 
establish and maintain good-will, 
confidence, justice, fair play, recogni- 
tion and extension of equal rights to 
coloured folk, in the great fight for 
progress of civilization and_better- 
ment of Mankind. 

Capt. Pat Bower of London 


The Cincinnati Inquirer is not sat- 
isfied with one editorial on-Dr. Du 


Bois’ lecture. It comes back the fol- 
lowing day and complains that 

the colored editor of an alleged American 
newspaper on Sunday asked of a Cincin- 
nati audience: “What rights have white 
people in China? Why are they there?” 
He already had anathematized their pres- 
ence in Haiti, Santo Domingo and else- 
where. 

What rights, indeed? The Moscow 
Government asks the same question. It 
asks also what rights have any people 
outside the ranks of Sovietism to be any- 
where? 

The world answers that the white 
nations have rights guaranteed to them 
by treaties regarded to be sacred and 
binding in the view of international 
comity since men and nations began 
to recognize the necessity and value 
of honorable agreements in their re- 
lationships. That these rights will be 
protected is not to be doubted. The 
answer to Editor Du Bois’s question 
is to be found in the Government’s or- 
ders to American army divisions and the 
presence of the greatest sea armada in 
the history of the Orient in Chinese 
waters. The white man has lost neither 
his self-respect nor his courage. 


If the treaties forced on China by 
England, France and the rest of the 
white world are “sacred and binding”, 
then up is down, black is white and 
wrong is right.

PEONAGE 


E have grave suspicions that the 

colored committee recently ap- 
pointed by Mr. Hoover to investigate 
flood conditions and peonage in the 
Mississippi Valley will be sorely 
tempted to whitewash the whole situa- 
tion, to pat Mr. Hoover loudly on 
the back, and to make no real effort 
to investigate the desperate and evil 
conditions of that section of our coun- 
try. Slavery still exists in the Missis- 
sippi Valley and this Committee knows 
it. Will they dare say so? The 13th 
Amendment is not enforced, much less 
the 14th and 15th. This Committee 
has the chance of a generation to make 
a thorough investigation and tell the 
truth or to stand up and let it be 
known that they are not permitted to 
make an investigation. The one fatal 
thing for them to do, and the thing 
for which the American Negro will 
never forgive them, is spineless surren- 
der to the Administration and flattery 
for the guilty Red Cross. 

P. S.: This was written in Au- 
gust. Friends said: “Don’t pre- 
judge. Wait. Give them a chance.” 
We have waited. Next month we 
shall have more to say. 


PREJUDICE 


E have received from Mrs. 

Helen D. Pecu of Vashon Isl- 
ands, Washington, the following let- 
ter: 

“I have hesitated many months in 
writing you but each time I read your 
editorials the impulse comes to pro- 
test, not because I am white, but for 
the sake of those whose skin pigment 
only has set them apart in an unjust 
world—a world of unreasoning preju- 
dice—that men like you have built up 
—for you are as violently prejudiced 
against all whites as the most intoler- 
ant white man is against you. It is 
deplorable that so excellent a maga- 
zine as THe Crisis should have at its 
head a man who sneers at all forms 
of government—save the Soviet gov- 
ernment in Russia—who can but in- 
timidate the budding courage and ge- 
nius of his people by his own big stick 
of prejudice. In strong contrast, how 
fine is the character of Allison Davis, 
whose article ‘On Misgivings’ ap- 


November, 1927 














































































What 


pears in the August Crisis. 
influence could he not wield between 


the two races! What respect would 
his cause not command. When we 
who regard the colored race with the 
same respect we feel for our own are 
assailed and derided because we are 
white, we begin to wonder if there 
might not have been in some age past 
a basic reason for this separation of 
the races, that reason now continuing 
in the form of prejudice on both sides 
between minds incapable of growth. 


“T do not refer to the publication of 
crimes or acts of injustice. They are 
facts that both races should gravely 
consider, but as any friend, white or 
colored, who has the interest of your 
race at heart, I ask you to withhold 
your private political and prejudiced 
rancor. It is improper material in 
your magazine and detracts from its 
constructive purpose.” 


There is no doubt but that colored 
people are prejudiced against white 
people, and that the Editor of THE 
Crisis is one of the greatest of sin- 
ners in this respect. - From long ex- 
perience he has gotten into the habit 





of expecting certain actions, certain 
thoughts, certain treatment from the 
majority of white people. He is some- 
times pleasantly disappointed. In 
most cases he is not. In most cases 
he gets just what he has been looking 
for, and it is quite possible that, in 
some of these instances, he gets it be- 
cause he has been expecting it! 


But in any case, the worse fruit 
of prejudice is retaliatory prejudice; 
because white Americans have reasons 
based on slavery, poverty and ignorance 
in the past and on thoughtlessness and 
lack of information in our own day, 
they have gotten into the habit of 
treating black folk in certain ways. 
Black folk have gradually adopted the 
reciprocal habit of hating white skins, 
of being suspicious of every white ac- 
tion, and particularly of talking and 
acting as though even those white peo- 
ple who are not prejudiced, or who 
earnestly desire not to be, belonged to 
the unfortunate majority. 


What Mrs. Pecu and others must 
learn is that this is the natural fruit 
of race prejudice. Just as no ordi- 
nary white man born and bred in the 
South can be expected to treat Ne- 
groes decently, in the same way, no 
Negro born in America can be expected 
to be sweet-tempered, charitable and 
broadminded toward white people. 

The Editor of a magazine like THE 
Crisis should nevertheless try to 
achieve such an attitude. He does 
try. If he fails, do not lay the fault 
entirely at his door. Lay it to the 
last lynching, or to the last time he 
was insulted in the theater, or to the 
last time he went hungry because all 
available hotels and restaurants were 
closed against him. It is all a mess, 
he admits and that is precisely what 
Tue Crisis has been trying to say for 
many years. 


SMITH 


E are filled with delight at the 

prospect that Governor Smith 
will be nominated by the Democrats. 
The South does not want Smith be- 
cause he is a Catholic; because he is 
a “Wet”; and because he is not “an 
aristocrat”! But if he is nominated, 
they have got to take him. No mat- 
ter what they say, they would not dare 


311 


to vote against him. If they did, their 
vote would break up the Solid South 
and usher in real democracy in the 
United States and that is the last thing 
that the South dares face. The dilemma 
of the white South in 1928 is as deli- 
cious as the dilemma of the black 
North when it was asked to choose be- 
tween Calvin Coolidge and John 
Davis. 


KRIGWA 


HREE hundred and seventy-five 

entries were made in the Krigwa 
prize contest for Negro literature and 
art, carried on by THe Crisis during 
the year 1927. The entries are of a 
higher order of merit than in any pre- 
vious contest. The editor has under- 
taken to read every single manuscript 
personally and instead of the drudgery 
he anticipated, the work has been a 
joy and inspiration. He has marked 
all the manuscripts on a scale as fol- 
lows: 

A—Excellent. 
sidered for prizes. 

B+—Good and worth publication. 

B—Good. 

C—Fair. 

D—Poor, but with some points to 
commend. 

E—Impossible. 

After the editor has personally 
chosen the A manuscripts (and he has 
already chosen most of them), he will

SOCIAL EQUALS 

HIS is a typical Negro American 

story which my friend told me 
the other night. He is a law exam- 
iner in one of the departments in 
Washington. . Recently, together with 
three other professional men, he made 
a trip to the biennial meeting of a col- 
ored fraternity in Detroit. They took 
the “Red Arrow” all Pullman train 
out of Washington. As they were 
talking in the smoking room, a porter 
came in. 

“A doctor, a doctor,” he cried. 
“There is a lady dying in my car! Is 
there a doctor in here?” 

My friend pointed to Dr. Dumas of 
Washington, one of his companions. 
Dr. Dumas is tall and handsome, with 
a smooth, dark-brown face. He is a 
skilled physician and surgeon. He rose 
immediately, got his medicine case and 
went into the next Pullman. An 
elderly Southern white woman had 
eaten too much and had a dangerous 
attack of acute indigestion. A hypo- 
dermic relieved her and Dr. Dumas 
came back to his companions. The 


Only these are con- 


next morning, he sauntered back to 


312 





the car and found the woman quite 
recovered. She thanked him; then she 
reached down in her valise, took out 
a ten dollar bill. Dr. Dumas bowed 
courteously. 

“QO, no, Madam,” he said. “This 
is my vacation and yours was an emer- 
gency case. I cannot think of taking 


a fee.” 
The woman insisted and got quite 
excited about it. But Dr. Dumas 


firmly refused and went back to his 





car. After a while a young white man 
came in. He said: “I am the son 
of Senator , of — I want 


to thank you very much for refusing 
to take that fee. The old woman in 
there is raising a great deal of excite- 
ment and is very angry. Of course 
you know what the trouble is. She 
thinks your refusal of a fee makes you 
assume to be her social equal and she 
is angry at any such assumption on 
your part. I am glad you did it. 
Some of the older generation of us 
Southerners are just plain fools. We 
younger people cannot, of course, get 
rid of all our prejudice, but we are 
certainly going to get rid of some.” 
He bowed and went out. 


GEORGIA 


HE fight between heaven and hell 

goes on in Georgia. The last 
legislature passed an interracial mar- 
riage law which is going to inquire into 
the racial antecedents of Georgia citi- 
zens so carefully that, as a dispatch 
from Atlanta says, “it will cause Geor- 
gians in large numbers to go outside 
the state to marry”. Negroes have 
only to state the fact in order to get 
marriage certificates, but Georgia 
whites have got to prove they are white 
and apparently, in a large number of 
cases, they cannot. In contrast to this 
foolishness comes the news that for 
the first time the legislature of Georgia 
has appropriated a decent sum for 
Negro higher education. For a long 
time the Georgia State Industrial Col- 
lege at Savannah received from the 
state only $10,000 a year, an amount 
which the state received from the 
United States and could not legally 
sequester. This year the school re- 
ceived an appropriation of $115,332, 
an increase of 476 per cent over any 
appropriation in the past. State and 
federal funds will now give the college 
an annual income of over $80,000. 
The General Education Board will 
add over $50,000 for buildings. 


LIBERIA 
HERE has been much _ under- 
ground discussion of Liberia in 
the colored world during the last few 
years, and some harsh judgements have 
been pronounced. There has been the 
case of the arrest of Bishop Brooks; 
the burning of John Hall, a natural- 








ized Liberian, born in America; the 
difficulties of Major Staten in trying 
to protect one of his sergeants. Fi- 
nally, there has been comment on the 
Firestone concession; and the re-elec- 
tion of President King for a third 
term. 

On the other hand, there has been 
much reassuring news: the payment 
by Liberia of its small debt to the 
United States; the reception of Presi- 
dent and Mrs. King in France and 
England; radio communication with 
the United States; and the notable in- 
crease in Liberian trade and revenue. 
Liberian exports have more than 
doubled since 1921; she has made sat- 
isfactory payments on her national 
debt; and she has arranged for the 
great Firestone rubber concession. Al- 
ready Liberian rubber is being ex- 
ported in considerable quantities. 

What now is a fair conclusion to 
make concerning Liberia’s status? 
First of all we must remember that 
Liberia is an independent country with 
its own law and courts. The place to 
right wrongs suffered in Liberia are 
the courts of Liberia. Bishop Brooks 
had been wronged by S. J. Taylor, 
whom he had made President of Mon- 
rovia College. Taylor had seized 
goods contributed by Americans to the 
college and had sought to make Bishop 
Brooks pay unfair debts. He even 
went so far as to have Bishop Brooks 
arrested. Bishop Brooks did exactly 
the thing he should have done. He 
fought the case through the courts, 
even suffering temporary imprisonment 
as a protest and finally won complete 
vindication and «redress. 

Hall was a murderer. He had 
strong provocation, and he was not 
furnished proper protection: but after 
all he had killed several persons; the 
attempt to arrest him which led to 
the burning of the building and of the 
man himself had to be made sometime 
and somehow. Bad judgment, not bad 
faith was the real fault. 

Again, Liberia must admit capital. 
It is impossible for any land today to 
remain outside of the circle of modern 
industry and commerce. Brute force 
drags all in. In admitting capital Li- 
beria had to make the best terms pos- 
sible and this she certainly did in the 
case of Firestone. So far as legal con- 
tract goes, Liberia received the strong- 
est protection and assurances. Natur- 
ally, predatory wealth in foreign in- 
vestment is not to be trusted; but Li- 
beria had no alternative; it was either 
English or French annexation, of 
American capital with the promise of 
continued independence. 

Finally, President King is un- 
doubtedly on the right track. He 
is keeping in close touch with the 
modern world. He is giving England, 
France and Amer- (Turn to page 322)

Industrial Loan Companies 
(From page 295) 


HE Board of Directors of each 

of these organizations is not 
necessarily made up of wealthy col- 
ored people, but rather influential peo- 
ple—those who can secure the coopera- 
tion of large numbers of other people 
who are willing to purchase at least a 
few shares. After one or two more 
cities are organized, a meeting of the 
officials of the finance companies in the 
various cities will probably be called 
for an exchange of ideas and for the 
purpose of improving the institutions 
along all lines. 

It is easy to conjecture what the 
economic gain to the race will be 
when thirty or more cities have finance 
companies with a paid-in capital of at 
least $100,000 each. The writer be- 
lieves that this number of cities can 
and will be successfully established in 
the next two or three years. For ex- 
ample, thirty cities with a capital of 
$100,000 would make a total capital 
of $3,000,000. The total resources 
of these institutions, including their 
real estate holdings, savings deposits, 
etc., should bring the amount up to 
between $10,000,000 and $15,000,000 
which would be available for financing 
industrial and real estate loans. 


T may be well here to differentiate 

between a finance company and a 
bank. The rules governing the op- 
eration of a bank are laid’ down by 
the State or National Governments, 
or both. The use of its capital is defi- 
nitely regulated by the state in which 
it operates and its loans must be made 
according to strict laws; no industrial 
loans are permitted. A finance com- 
pany, on the other hand, while oper- 
ated under the general supervision of 
the state, is, nevertheless, permitted 
to make loans as its stockholders may 
direct. Personal and Industrial loans 
in small amounts of $15, $20 and up, 
payable in weekly or monthly install- 
ments, may be made. ‘The general 
purpose ‘of these small loans is to help 
the working man to lump all of his 
debts and to repay the one debt in 
small weekly or monthly installments. 

In brief, a finance company uses its 
funds as it deems best, just like any 
other corporation. The finance com- 
panies in no way conflict with banks, 
but greatly help banks by encouraging 
thrift and independence on the part 
of the masses, thus educating them to 
become better depositors. With the 
increasing growth of buying on the 
installment plan such articles as ra- 
dios, pianos, phonographs, automobiles 
and household necessities, finance com- 
panies among Negroes will have a 
much larger opportunity to discount 
good paper at a more profitable rate

than ever before. So far none of the 
companies already organized has ven- 
tured into the latter field to any ex- 
tent. 

The whole, varied field of finance 
offers very fertile outlets for Negro 
capital. The primary need at present 
is intelligent, honest and far-seeing 
leadership. There is no question that 
Negroes handle in the aggregate vast 
sums of capital. What is needed is 
the organizing of sufficient capital into 
well-managed institutions in the larger 
cities in order that real, effective financ- 
ing of worthy individuals and sound 
projects can ‘be carried on. For it is 
becoming increasingly evident that un- 
less Negroes begin to finance them- 
selves their economic expansion will be 
seriously retarded in normal times and 
well-nigh impossible in periods of in- 
dustrial depression. 


One Boy’s Story 
(From page 299) 
HE stopped and hugged my head 
—like I wish she wouldn’t some- 
times and then went out. 

I stayed still until she got out of 
the yard. Then I ran and got my rifle 
and sling-shot and followed her. 

I crept behind her in the bushes be- 
side the road. I cut across the fields 
and came out behind the willow patch 
the way I always do when I am track- 
ing Indians and wild animals. 

By and by she came out in the clear- 
ing that is behind Dr. Somerset’s. 
They call it Somerset’s Grove and it’s 
named for his folks who used to live 
there—just as the town was. 

She sat down so I lay down in the 
bushes. A sharp rock was sticking in 
my knee but I was afraid to move for 
fear she’d hear me and send me home. 

By and by I heard someone walking 
on the grass and I saw Dr. Swyburne 
coming up. He started talking before 
he got to her. “Louise,” he said. 
“Louise! I am not going to give any- 
thing up to a nigger.” 

“Not even a nigger woman whom 
you took from a nigger?” She lifted 
her mouth in the senna and manna 
way. 


TT ON’T say that!” he said. 

“Don’t say that! I wanted a 
son. I couldn’t have taken a woman 
in my own world—that would have 
ruined my practice. Elaine couldn’t 
have a child!” 

“Yes,” Ma said. “It would have 
ruined you and your profession. What 
did it do for me? What did it do for 
Donald?” 

“T have told you I will give him the 
best the world can offer. He is a 
Swyburne!” 

“He is my child,” Ma hollered. “It

“But I give him everything a father 
could give his son!” 

“He has no name!” Ma said. 

“T have too!” I hollered inside of 
me. ‘Donald Gage!” 

“He has no name,” Ma said again, 
“and neither have I!” And she be- 
gan to cry. 

“He has blood!” said Dr. Swy- 
burne. 

“But how did he get it? Oh, I’m 
through. Stay away from my house 
and I’ll marry one of my own men so 
Donald can be somebody.” 

“A nigger’s son?” 

“Don’t say that again,” Ma hol- 
lered and jumped up. 

“Do you think I'll give up a woman 
of mine to a nigger?” 

Ma hollered again and hit him right 
in his face. 

He grabbed her wrists and turned 
the right one, I guess because she fell 
away from him on that side. 

I couldn’t stand any more. I 
snatched out my sling-shot and pulled 
the stone up that was sticking in my 
knee. 

I started to shoot. Then I remem- 
bered what David said first, so I shut 
my eyes and said it: “Do thou, Je- 
hovah (which is God today), lend 


strength to my arm”. 


HEN I opened my eves Ma had 

broken away and was running 
toward the road. Dr. Swyburne was 
standing still by the tree looking after 
her like he was going to catch her. 
His face was turned sideways to me. 
I looked at his head where his hair 
was brushed back from the side of his 
face. 

I took aim and let the stone go. I 
heard him say: “Oh, my God!” I 
saw blood on his face and I saw him 
stagger and fall against the tree. 

Then I ran too. 

When I got home Ma was sitting 
in her chair with her hat thrown on 
the floor beside her and her head was 
lying back. 

I walked up to her: “Ma,” I said 
real loud. 

She reached out and grabbed me 
and hugged my head down to her neck 
like she always does. 

The big breast-pin scratched my 
mouth. I opened my mouth to speak 
and something hot and sharp ran into 
my tongue. 

“Ma! Ma!” I tried to holler. 
“The pin is sticking in my tongue!” 


* * * 


DON’T know what I said though. 
When I tried to talk again, Ma 
and Dr. Somerset were looking down 
at me and I was lying in bed. I tried 
to say something but I could not say 
anything. My mouth felt like it was

full of hot bread and 1 could not talk 
around it. 

Dr. Somerset poured something in 
my mouth and it felt like it was on 
fire. 

“They found Shev Swyburne in my 
thistle grove this afternoon,” he said 
to Ma. 

Ma looked up quick. “Found him! 
What do you mean?” 

“T mean he was lying on the ground 
—either fell or was struck and fell. 
He was dead from a blow on the 
temple.” 

I tried to holler but my tongue was 
too thick. 

Ma took hold of each side of her 
face and held to it, then she just stared 
at Dr. Somerset. He put a lot of 
things back in his bag. 

Then he sat up and looked at Ma. 
“Louise,” he said, “why is all that 
thistle down on your skirt?” 

Ma looked down. So did I. There 
was thistle down all over the hem of 
her dress. 

“You don’t think.I killed him, do 
you?” she cried, “you don’t think I 
did it?” Then she cried something 
awful. 

I tried to get up but I was too dizzy. 
I crawled across the bed on my stomach 
and reached out to the chair that had 
my pants on it. It was hard to do— 
but I dragged my sling shot out of my 
pocket, crawled back across the bed 
and laid it in Dr. Somerset’s knees. 
He looked at me for a minute. 

“Are you trying to tell me that you 
did it, son?” he asked me. 

I said yes with my head. 

“My God! My God!! 
child!!!” 

Dr. Somerset said to Ma: “God 
isn’t dead yet.” 


His own 


HEN he patted her on the arm 

and told her not to tell anybody 
nothing and they sat down and picked 
all the thistle down out of the skirt. 
He took the sling-shot and broke it all 
up and put it all in a paper and car- 
ried it downstairs and put it in the 
stove. 

I tried to talk. I wanted to tell 
him to leave it so I could show my 
grandchildren what I had used to free 
Ma like the men do in the books. 

I couldn’t talk though. My tongue 
was too thick for my mouth. The 
next day it burnt worse and things be- 
gan to float around my eyes and head 
like pieces of wood in the water. 

Sometimes I could see clearly though 
and once I saw Dr. Somerset talking 
to another man. 
saying: “We'll have to operate to 
save his life. His tongue is poisoned. 


I am afraid it will take his speech from 


him

He will not talk! Never! He can't

like she always does and that time it 
sounded like she was laughing too. 

The other man looked funny and 
said: ‘Some of them have no natutal 
feeling of parent for child!” 

Dr. Somerset looked at him and 
said: “You may be fine as a doctor 
but otherwise you are an awful fool.” 

Then he told the other man to go 
out and he began talking to Ma. 

“IT understand! I understand,” he 
said. “I know all about it. He took 
you away from somebody and some of 
these days he might have taken Donald 
from you. He took Elaine from me 
once and I told him then God would 
strip him for it. Now it is all over, 
Never tell anyone and I will not. The

O I got a black stump in my mouth 
It’s shaped like a forked whip. 

Some days I pretend I am Orestes 
with the Furies’s whips in my mouth 
for killing a man. 

Some days I pretend I am Oedipus 
and that I cut it out for killing my 
own father. 

That’s what makes me sick all over 
sometimes. 

I killed my own father. But I 
didn’t know it was my father. I was 
freeing Ma. 

Still—I shall never write that on 
my paper to Ma and Dr. Somerset the 
way I have to talk to them and tell 
them when things hurt me. 

My father said I was a Swyburne 
and that was why I liked people to 
be brave and courageous. 

Ma says I am a Gage and that is 
why I am brave and courageous. 

But I am both, so I am a whole lot 
brave, a whole lot courageous. And I 
am bearing my Furies and my clipped 
tongue like a Swyburne and a Gage 
—’'cause I am both of them.

(From page 300) Mother Goose 
would not have enjoyed my changing 
her famous rhyme, 
“One misty moisty morning 
When cloudy was the weather, 


I chanced to meet an old man 
Clothed all in leather.” 


But this foggy morning I went 
through the dews and found little fat 
brown spiders watching the daintiest 
of webs. These were stretched to tree 
branches or fastened to sprigs of dried 
bushes. The dew was upon them in 
drops as tiny as needle heads, sprinkled 
all along the delicate strands like 
strung pearls and crystals, festoons for 
the fairies.

LRN tA OL RTE Pal SOT NRE TEAST AIP a POO 


COUNTED _ twenty-five little 

cords spraying from the center of a 
web in the pear tree. How carefully 
the airy bridges or traps were arranged 
to fit into crevices and hold fast. The 
spider herself was hiding and looked 
like the brown notches on the tree, a 
shabby owner, that rusty creature, of 
all those diamonds and pearls on twen- 
ty-five strings! She reminded me of 
the little old fashioned tea pots of 
brown earthware that grandmothers 
kept on their ranges. 

The spiders are a funny folk. Peo- 
ple would use them as silk makers, 
but they won’t spin much when con- 
fined, though their silk, we are told, 
is quite as good as the best of silk 
worm products. They moreover have 
a way of lunching upon one another 
when placed together. Too bad to 
have to call them cannibals, yet we 
know: that many a lady spider has de- 
voured the suitor who has come to 
woo her. He would timidly tap on 
her web, be admitted to her cell, and 
then? Eaten! 


The Browsing Reader 
(From page 308) sands of the desert, 


in the green valley of the Nile and in 
the lithe black bodies of the natives. 

For a couple of centuries or so now, 
we have heard rumors of our superior- 
ity in the native musical ability. ‘“Ne- 
groes are natural born musicians!’’ We 
have heard it and we have liked it. 
Just when we are quite convinced that 
we are all embryonic songbirds or 
pianists or violinists, Guy B. Johnson 
comes along and shatters our fondest 
dream. The Southern Workman for 
October carries an interesting article 
on “The Negro and Musical Talent’. 
Through a series of scientific tests Mr. 
Johnson finds that there are “no sig- 
nificant differences in the basic sensory 
musical capacities between whites and 
Negroes”. However, he finds that 
there is more individualistic talent 
among Negroes than whites. The 
white distribution shows a large pro- 
portion of average scores while the 
Negro distribution shows a great many 
very low scores as well as a great many 
exceptionally high ones. 

According to an editorial by H. L. 
Mencken in the October Mercury, Ne- 
groes are dictating to white America 
the latest fads in clothes, the odor of 
bootleg whiskey, how and when to 
raise the voice, just at what angle to 
throw the arms when dancing the 
Charleston and the thing to eat. We 
have gone so far even as to marry into 
white “aristocracy”. Certainly we 
should be satisfied! But strangely 
enough, we aren’t! 

Century for October carries “The 
Long Furrow” by Lyle Saxon. It is 
the story of a black man whose life 


322 


consists of plowing and dreaming; and 
of a white man who is slowly dying 
from tuberculosis. The latter realizes 
his dependence on the Negro too late 
to help him realize his dreams. ‘The 
story might have been artistic and virile 
were it not besmeared with too much 
sentimentality. 

Wallace Thurman writes on 
“Nephews of Uncle Remus” in the 
Independent for September 24. To 
our way of thinking this is by far the 
best article Mr. Thurman has done. 
He criticizes the work of five of the 
best known “New Negroes” and in 
most cases “discovers the jewel and 
casts away the stone”. To be sure, 
Mr. Thurman is a little harsh in his 
criticisms, but we need just such a 
balance to offset the saccharine effu- 
sions of some of our panegyrists. 

“Should the Negro be Encouraged 
to Cultural Equality?” is the text of 
a debate conducted by the Forum for 
October with Alain Locke represent- 
ing the affirmative and Lothrop Stod- 
dard the. negative. Mr. Locke clouds 
the issue we think, by not making 
clear the difference between the terms 
“social equality” and “cultural recog- 
nition”, He should have made clear to 
the reader that although black John 
Jones is recognized in the closest liter- 
ary circles as the author of the most 
artistic book of the year and is, there- 


fore, “one of the boys”, the waitress _ 


down at Childs’ doesn’t know or care 
whether or not he is equally dusky 
Bob Smith, the corner bootblack. Mr. 
Stoddard, probably the best known of 
the anti-Negro propagandists, answers 
in no unequivocal terms that white 
America is and always will remain 
white. But say we, suppose we jog 
along. under the same conditions and 
at the same steady rate for fifty or a 
hundred years more, is it safe to guess 
that Mr. Stoddard will have even 
more definite proof than he now has, 
that America for some reason or other 
has taken on a duskier hue?

Postscript 
(From page 312) ica not the slightest 


valid excuse for interfering with Li- 
beria. There may be, there probably 
are, other men in Liberia who could 
follow out this program, but it’ ¢er- 
tainly seems to be wise to keep Presi- 
dent King in his present job until his 
program is more nearly finished. 

Liberia has difficult internal prob- 
lems: problems of law and order, of 
the treatment of natives, of work and 
wages, of the protection of foreigners; 
but one thing is certain: Liberia is 
stronger today in its independence than 
it has been for a half century. And 
that is something for which all Ne- 
groes should be proud.
