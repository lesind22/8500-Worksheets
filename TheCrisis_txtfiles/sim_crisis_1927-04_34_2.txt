The Education of the Bond Family 


HAVE consented to write the story 

of the education of my family with 
the sincere hope that it may help to 
impress upon our young people the tre- 
mendous importance of what is known 
as collegiate and university training 
and further may inspire young parents 
to dedicate their lives to the most 
sacred obligation of giving their chil- 
dren the best education that they are 
capable of taking and that the parents 
are able to provide. 

In the second place, it should be said 
that my family is typical, there being 
probably hundreds of Negro parents 
who could tell a finer story of struggle 
and achievement than I. 

My family had a good mental, 
- moral and spiritual background. My 
mother, a slave, was given away as a 
wedding present to her young mistress 
and taken from her mountain home 
to the Bluegrass country at the age of 
fifteen. After Emancipation she re- 
turned to her original home, taking 
with her her two sons who first saw 
the light in the closing days of the 
Civil War. 

Single handed and facing obstacles 
that to ordinary women would have 
been insurmountable and with pro- 
phetic vision, this unlettered slave 
mother sét herself to the task of edu- 
cating her two sons, of giving them 
what was called in those days a “classi- 
cal education”. How well she per- 
formed her task’ may be judged from 
the story that follows. 4 

Fired by the teaching of my mother, 
at the age of sixteen with all of my 
belongings in a pillow case and driv- 
ing a steer, I started out to get an 
education. I walked the entire dis- 
tance of seventy-five miles to Berea 
College where a few years later my 
brother Henry followed me. Enter- 
ing the primary department, after thir- 
teen years of experiences that would 
fill a book, ranging all the way from 
comedy to tragedy, I was graduated 
with the degree of B. S. Three years 
in Oberlin Graduate School of The- 
ology gave me the degree of B. D., 
followed later by the degrees of M. S. 
and D. D. from Berea. 

Henry, the younger son, having also 
received his education at Berea re- 
turned to his mountain home in eastern 
Kentucky where he became a promi- 
nent attorney, land-owner and influen- 
tial citizen. Of his nine children, 
seven have completed collegiate and 
professional courses in such schools as 
Knoxville, Meharry, Rush Medical 
College, two becoming physicians, one 
a college professor. The two youngest

and bent every effort to cultivate in 
the youngsters a love of good litera-

to shoot. We hiked together, spent 
nights out in the open discussing the 
mysteries of the worlds about us and 
slept beneath the stars, wrapped in our 
blankets. It was a happy day for me 
when the older boys could bring down 
game birds with more accuracy than 
their father. One of the proudest 
moments of my life was the day when

sight and of indomitable courage and 
also possessed with a passion for the 
education of her children. 

Our children had, therefore, a sub- 
stantial background and began their 
young lives in an atmosphere of deep 
religious fervor, intellectual intensity 
and altruistic idealism. The domi- 
nant note in our home was Christian 
education, “classical” or “higher” edu- 
cation. 


UCH of the education of our 

children was done in the home. 
We felt that the mere imparting of 
knowledge, rule and formula, impor- 
tant as it was, was rather a minor part 
of training for life work, that the set- 
ting up of proper ideals, the creating

was not this to be typical of their 
lives ever afterward ; was not life itself 
a venture, a risk, a struggle; and was 
it not my duty to see that these boys 
were trained for this great adventure; 
and was it not true that much of this 
training must be done before they 
reached the college or university? And 
in this adventure, this struggle, were 
they not to need more than almost any- 
thing else pluck, courage, determina- 
tion, the never-give-up spirit? Remem-

it had been these elements that had car-

T so happened that after the Atlanta 
| riots of September 1906 I was asked 

to go South to note conditions 
among the Negroes, especially in their 
relations to the whites. I made a 
leisurely trip, spending the winter and 
spring in the Gulf states, particularly 
Alabama. I sent a number of my im- 
pressions to the Evening Post. Now, 
for the first time in twenty-one years, 
except for a brief trip to Atlanta, I 
have seen again some of the same places 
and have even been able to talk witt. 
some of the same people. It has been 
interesting to note where conditions 
seem static and where there is change. 


The prosperity that is so evident in 
the North is evident also in the South. 
It is pleasanter traveling than former- 
ly. The hotels, even in small cities, 
are clean and well run. There are at- 
tractive shops where one can even buy 
books. More streets are well-paved 
and new school buildings are apparent. 
Jackson, Mississippi, seemed especially 
modern, a far neater, cleaner capitoi 
than Albany. One would enjoy having 
to hike there to attend a hearing. Good 
automobile roads link the larger cities 
and train travel, even on the local in 
the day-coach, is not an ordeal. The 
wayside station has known the mop of 
the cleaning woman. Watching the 
people, white and colored, from the 
train, one notes fewer rags and more 
mail-order clothes. Even the hogs have 
changed. The razor-back is less com- 
mon on the highway and in the field, 
giving place to his better-bred brother 
in the pig-pen. And the trains, in my 
three weeks’ travel, were always on 
time! 

On the other hand, the rural land- 
scape, for hundreds of miles, seems un- 
changed. Through the rolling coun- 
try the crops arécorn and cotton, noth- 
ing else. The tree is the pine, too 
many already cut for timber. The clay 
roads wash into gullies and the grass is 
only an ugly weed. One reads so much 
of the luxurious growth of the South- 
land, but it must be confined to a 
small area. ertainly, where man 
touches these hillsides, they become 
ugly. The log-cabin has long ago given 
place to the clapboard house of two 
or four, or even six rooms, but the 
house is unpainted and it stands on its 
props like a wart on the landscape. The 
open space is not enclosed and under 
its floor roam the poultry and the pigs. 
The ground about it is bare, with no 
shrubs planted near. A New England 
farmhouse, with its lilac bush at the

Changes in Twenty-one 
Years 
oe me: 








deorway, its elm tree by the road, has 
a far more colorful and luxuriant set- 
ting. Here, the hot summers kill the 
grass and the red clay washes away in 
the rain, so that where you have a 
path today, you have a gully tomorrow. 
To make a farmhouse lovely requires 
far more time and patience than it does 
in the North. And since the majority 
of the people in the cabins are tenants, 
why think of taking the trouble? Roses 
will bloom, they know, even among the 
chickens and the pigs. 


USKEGEE, where I made my 

first stop, shows a great change 
after twenty-one years. The straggling 
group of buildings has become an im- 
posing and beautiful campus. But ir 
is not the buildings that impress me 
most. However familiar the landscape 
through which I have traveled may 
have been, the students, as they march 
down the road into chapel, look dif- 
ferent. They carry themselves with 
an assurance that was formerly lack- 
ing. They are better set up, espe- 
cially the girls. One notices that 
they are younger than the 1906 girls, 
a sure sign of economic improvement 
in the condition’ of the parents. 
There are no longer numbers of men 
and women in the twenties, coming 
here for their first chance at an edu- 
cation. Negro illiteracy is still féund 
in the South, but it is not in the class 
that is willing to work its way to win 
an education at Tuskegee. Later I 
went to the Calhoun Colored School. 
Here, too, the condition was the same, 
—a younger age for the students and 
more alertness, more confidence. 

Many influences have been at work 
in these twenty-one years to producc 
this change of attitude, but the funda- 
mental one has been the improvement 
in the colored man’s economic condi- 
tion. The exodus to the cities, and 
especially to the North, has been going 
on for a dozen years and its effect is 
noticeable. The distraught landlord 
has used old ways of force and violence 
to prevent it, but he has been unable 
to keep his tenants from getting away. 
Even, I was told, in the bottom lands, 
where the soil is rich, where profits are 
large and where peonage flourishes, the 
Negro has managed to escape. Untilled 





acres have forced the white plantation 
owners to share their prosperity in some 
measure with their remaining tenants 
if they are to have any prosperity at al!. 
Twenty-one years ago, at Calhoun, 
I heard sickening stories of cruelty. 
Black tenants had been murdered and 
beatings-up were not uncommon. 
There was one Negro going about bent 
double, as a result of a too-horrible 
beating. But there was no story of 
brutality to relate today. If men in- 
tend to keep their tenants, they must 
treat them with consideration, There 
has been a veritable change of heart in 
one landlord. He has abandoned 
peonage and is known today for his 
fairminded policy. But still the ten- 
ants are leaving as they are leaving the 
country all over the United States. 


HERE is a form of segregation, I 
am told, going on in the rural 
districts, that may in time check emi- 
gration. When two or three colored 
families of more than average intelli- 
gence are in a community, thy attract 
others to the same place. They see the 
chance for a better church, perhaps 
for a decent rural school. The coming 
in of more Negroes is accompanied by 
a tendency on the part of the whites to 
leave. Their energetic members will go 
where the whites predominate. So, 
without legislation, which always 
works badly, Negroes are tending to 
build up little communities by them- 
selves. This may prove important; for 
as long as the Negroes are separated by 
iaw from the whites in their education- 
al and social life, they will probably 
do better to gravitate into such rural 
groups. “They may even gain enough 
in power to be able to voice their de- 
mands. They are still shamefully 
cheated in the distribution of state 
funds for education and for any local 
improvements. 


TLANTA, after its race riots in 
1906, had a sinister look. But it 

is in Atlanta today that I find the one 
outstanding movement in the South for 
the improvement of conditions among 
the Negroes, the Interracial Commis- 
sion. I suspect that the riots were the 
beginning of a serious probing of 
hearts in that city, as happened later 
in Chicago. But while a local move- 
ment started in Atlanta after the riot, 
the Interracial Commission, operating 
throughout the South, came at the 
close of the World War. It worked 
at first to prevent violence against the 
returning Negro soldier. For a short

time it received a little money from 
the War Work Council. After the 
excitement of the returning troops had 
died down and colored and white were 
back at their hum-drum work, the 
Commission entered upon an organized 
effort to promote better relations be- 
tween the two races. 

The Committee succeeds or fails in 
securing justice for the Negro, in gain- 
ing for him a more equitable division 
of schoo! funds, in promoting health, 
in preventing violence, according to 
the power and enthusiasm of the white 
persons who head the movement in 
their community. The Negroes are 
brought into consultation and they 
sometimes speak plain truths; but they 
are disfranchised, treated as a people 
apart and their cooperation is rather a 
compliment than a right. They may 
express their wants, but they must 
look to the whites to secure them. 
Thus, as I have said, the success of the 
Commission in securing definite ad- 
vantages for the Negro depends upon 
the aggressiveness of the whites. In 
Atlanta, I found that the Commission 
had been instrumental in bringing to 
the Negro a share in the city’s welfare 
work. The new high school,—Atlanta 
has waited all these years to build a 
Negro high school,—has come probably 
more through the efforts of the 
Negroes than through the Commission. 
There is one time when the colored 
man has political power in a southern 
city—when there is an election on the 
question of the issuance of bonds. At- 
lanta Negroes refused to vote for a 
bond issue until they had a clear under- 
standing that they would have a new 
high school. But such other good 
things that have come their way the 
Negroes owe largely to the energy of 
their white friends. 


T is open to question whether the 

Commission is always a benefit. A 
thoughtful colored woman in Memphis 
told me that it could be a hindrance 
rather than a help. An aggressive 
Negro may be put on the city commis- 
sion and then be forced to do nothing. 
When he complains, he: is told that he 
must be silent or he will hurt the or- 
ganization of which he is a part. He is 
given 2 position and kept quiet by 
promises. I thought of this when in 
Augusta. Augusta has not had a 
new school building for Negroes in 
twenty-one years. ‘Two of the build- 
ings were very old then, one a bar- 
racks left from the Civil War, a nasty 
location, set in a dirty slum, a railroad 
track on one side and a canal on the 
other. The Commission has wide- 
awake, able Negroes in its member- 
ship, but they are told to trust the 
whites and to be sure not to vote 
against bond issues. Perhaps the Com- 


April, 1927 





mission is helpless. Augusta may be a 
mean city. Certainly her northern 
tourists are indifferent and useless. I 
know that her public school buildings 
for colored children are the most dis- 
graceful things I saw in the South. 

But it is not in the realm of actual 
achievement that the Interracial Com- 
mission, as I learned to know of it in 
my trip, is of chief importance. It is 
in its spirit. And nothing could be 
more fortunate than that it should have 
as its chief executive a humane, fair- 
minded man, without cant and with- 
out prejudice. Mr. Will W. Alex- 
ander, executive secretary, white recipi- 
ent of a Harmon Award for 1926, is, 
therefore, trusted by the Negroes, 
radicals and conservatives. And the 
work that he is doing quietly through- 
out the South is bringing educated 
white people into pleasant contact with 
educated colored people. He does this 
not only through the meetings of the 
Commission, but in various ways. To 
do it at all is a revolution. 

Only a white person who has been 
accustomed to move freely among 
Negroes can appreciate the segregation 
of the South. It stares you in the 
face. Continually you see the signs 
“White”, “Colored”. I even saw in 
an Arkansas courthouse, “WHITE 
WATER” “COLORED WATER’, 
with a fine disdain »f punctuation, 
When you enter the railroad station, 
you see the colored shunted off to an 
inferior waiting room. You buy your 
ticket at one window, they at another. 
You ride in separate coaches. When 
you leave your train, you must watch 
that you do not walk toward the 
celored section, though you are not 
likely to make a mistake, since to you, 
while you pay no more, is always given 
the best accommodation. In the street 
car, yours are the front seats. At every 
turn you are shown that a colored man 
belongs with the “untouchables”. To 
grow up in this atmosphere means to be 
painfully conscious when in the pres- 
ence of any Negro who is not a 
servant. It means too the besmearing 
Negroes with the stigma of “colored” 
wherever they may travel, from the 
North pole to the equator. The 
southerner’s idea of segregation is to 
deny the educated Negro the right to 
remain anywhere where he, the south- 
erner, has decided to put his foot. He 
is denied all those beautiful things that 
accompany city life—art, music, the 
drama. He may not hear an opera, 
or see a good play, or enter a public 
library. This is the gospel which the 
southerner has preached, day in and 
day out, throughout the world. 


VER against this, the Interra~ial 
Commission is preaching an>ther 
gospel—the plain, unannotated doc- 


It is 
doing this by education, by showing 
the white world what the colored

world is like. It accomplishes it in its 
literature, in its promotion of courses 
on the race question in Southern Uni- 
versities, but most of all through what 
it calls its Adventures in Good-will. 

An attempt to recite the picasant 
ways in which colored and white have 
been brought together wou:! spoil the 
whole work. Friendliness should “ot 
be turned into a spectacle. Onc tay 
note a few instances—such as the sing- 
ing of the spirituals by colored choirs 
in white churches, the white choir later 
making its way through an unfamiliar, 
neglected neighborhood to take part in 
the services of a well-appointed Negro 
church. When I was at Atlanta Uni- 
versity, students in its senior class had 
just been meeting with students in the 
white colleges. ‘And we had a pleas- 
ant, interesting time,” one of the girls 
told me. The Y. M. C. A. and the 
Y. W. C. A. have held many meetings 
of white and colored. The young peo- 
ple of the two races are having a chance 
to interchange ideas. 


HE most dramatic interracial story 

that I heard on my trip was that 
of the work of George W. Carver of 
Tuskegee. Professor Carver is in 
charge of the chemistry department and 
has engaged in important research, se- 
curing hundreds of prodvets from the 
peanut and the sweet potato. Re- 
cently, he has been making paints of 
extraordinary brilliance from red clay. 
He is an elderly maa, unassuming, a 
quiet, industrious scholar and a lover 
of men. The Interracial Conamission 
secured an invitation for him to lec- 
ture on chemistry before a white col- 
lege. He gave his talk, not a word of 
it remotely touching the race problem. 
But when the lecture was over the 
boys crowded about him, leaning over 
his shoulders, interested deeply in his 
subject and loving his personality. 
They have seen a great scientist and 
he is black. A man who was born a 
slave. They find him with those lov- 
able qualities that the old fashioned 
writers delighted to portray. They get 
to know him. And while he helps 
them as one of Joel Chandler Har- 
ris’s or Thomas Nelson Page’s old un- 
cles helped his boys in the past, they 
sec that he is not the servant sitting 
in the kitchen, but the chemist in his 
laboratory, Fellow of the Royal So- 
ciety of Great Britain, recipient of 
the Spingarn Medal in the United 
States. Without saying a word on the 
subject of race, Professor Carver is 
the best propagandist for the doctrine 
of good fellowship that the Interracial 
Commission knows.

Brazil 


A Review of “The Conquest of Brazil” As Told by ROY NASH 


EARLY every American who 
N has written of Brazil has been at 

special pains to ignore the Negro 
and the Indian. They may be mentioned 
as slaves or peons, but we are given 
tacitly to understand that Brazil is a 
white country done by white folk; and 
that while it may have its peculiar 
brand of “race problems,” neverthe- 
less, it is emerging “white”. Of 
course, Roy Nash could have written 
no book like that. Mr. Nash was the 
third Secretary of the National Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People. He came to us in 1917 
and served two years, when the Asso- 
ciation gave him and its Chairman, 
Major Spingarn, to the Great War. 

After the war, Captain Nash went 
to Brazil and in 1926 he published his 
great work on Brazil,* which immedi- 
ately becomes the standard work and 
interpretation of Brazil for English 
readers. But it is not simply standard, 
it is readable; and it is not simply read- 
able, it dares to be frank and true. 

In his very first chapter, he says, 
speaking of the year 1500 when Por- 
tugal and Lisbon led the world upon 
the sea: 

“White hands, in whose clutches 
naked black bodies writhed powerless, 
reached out of the North, reached up 
from the sea and grasped their daugh- 
ters and sons, their chiefs and their 
priests and their most stalwart war- 
riors. Into the Unknown they went, 
in chains. Not one came back. Ca- 
lamity brooded above the blacks of 
West Africa on New Year’s Day, in 
the year of our Lord 1500. 

“But across the blue water to the 
west, other gentle savages reclined in 
their hammocks along the Amazon, 
naked brown tobacco-smokers uncon- 
cerned about the morrow, for they still 
had three months to rehearse for the 
ceremony of being discovered and there 
was probably not one among those 
Hopeless Heretycks who would have 
offered a Brazil nut for all the bless- 
ings Christianity had to confer. The 
simple souls did not even know that 
1500, the Year of their Doom, had 
dawned. 

“Portuguese, Negroes, Indians. 


“These are to play the leading parts 
in the drama we are about to witness.”

HEN he begins his story. First 

he frankly regards the story of 
Brazil as a story of race mixture on 
the widest modern scale. He sweeps 
aside legends of absolutely and eter- 
nally separate races: 


“Scientifically minded men are no 
longer given to characterizing the 
traits of races in the offhand manner 
of a generation cr two ago. The dif- 
ference between primitive and civil- 
ized man we are finding to be so slight 
that one cannot throw stones at the 
savage without danger of hitting the 
savant.” 


And he studies the Indians and the 
Negroes whose work and blood went 
to make Brazil. 


“Tf it is difficult for a civilized mind 
to enter sympathetically into the mind 
of a naked forest Indian, it is well- 
nigh impossible to contemplate the Ne- 
gro except through a veil of prepos- 
session and prejudice which distorts the 
image and warps the most patent fact. 
Yet the day is not distant when all 
men will be forced by the logic of 
events and the siftings of science to 
recognize the simple truth, that one 
species, Homo sapiens, embraces the to- 
tality of human beings upon this earth 
and that there is_no widespread type 
of mankind but has vital contributions 
to make to any civilization intelligent 
enough to avail itself thereof.” 


He gives a long and sympathetic ac- 
count of primitive Negro civilization. 


“Nothing but archeological finds yet 
to be made can wrest from the Negro 
his claim to be the inventor of the 
smelting of iron, the very keystone of 
modern industrial civilization, a gift 
to the race that ranks with fire or writ- 
ten speech.” 

Mr. Nash notes the Negroid strain 
of the Portuguese themselves, both be- 
fore and after the African slave trade. 

“From the period of Moorish domi- 
nance in Portuguese history three 
things are worth stressing as bearing 
directly upon iwentieth century Brazil 
and the first has to do with just that 
subtle difference between brown and 
brunet. Many North Americans pro- 
fess horror at the intermarriage of 
white and colored types which is so 
common in South America. Mark 
well, then, that the first contact of the 
Portuguese and Spanish with a darker- 
skinned people was the contact of 
the conquered with their brown- 
skinned conquerors. And the darker 
man was the more cultured, more 





learned, more artistic. He lived in the 
castles and occupied the towns. He 
was the rich man and the Portuguese 
became serfs upon his land. Under 
such conditions, it would be deemed an 
honor for the white to marry or mate 
with the governing class, the brown 
man, instead of the reverse. Nor was 
it only the Portuguese peasantry whose 
blood mingled with the Moors: Al- 
fonso VI, who united Castile, Leon 
and Galicia in 1073, to cite but one of 
many instances of marriages between 
Christian and Arab nobles, chose a 
Moorish princess, the daughter of the 
Emir of Seville, to be the mother of 
his son Sancho.” 


R. NASH declares of the pres- 
ent Brazilian race formed of 

Iberian Negroes and Indians: 

“When, to the strains mingled by 
the migrations of man to and fro across 
the Iberian Peninsula, you add the 
blood of the American Indian (first 
cousin of the Asiatic Mongolian) and 
the African Negro, you are going to 
get a type that is more nearly an aver- 
age and a synthesis of the totality of 
humanity than anything that has ex- 
isted upon this planet since differentia- 
tion began. From the biologic angle, 
the Brazilian drama develops a theme 
of tremendous import for the race.” 

Mr. Nash’s treatise is divided into 
four parts. The first, of five chap- 
ters, is on the peopling of the lands. 
It studies the Indian, the Negro and 
the Portuguese; the physical charac- 
teristics of the country and the history 
of its settlement. Mr. Nash estimates 
that a million and a half Negroes 
landed in Brazil between 1821 and 
1850. In the century from 1821 to 
1921 there has been added to this mil- 
lion and a half Negroes, three millions 
of Mediterranean peoples and three 
hundred fifty thousand from Central 
Europe, making the total original Ne- 
gro element about twenty-nine per 
cent. 

He then explains the attitude of 
Brazil toward the Negro: 


66 ree was the most signifi- 
cant single fact in sixteenth, sev- 
enteenth, eighteenth and nineteenth 
century Brazil. How she finally 
emerged from Negro slavery without 
hatred is perhaps the finest tale in her 
whole history.” 
He gives credit for rauch of this at- 
titude to the Marquis Pombal as “the 
originator of the great Brazilian idea: 


Tue Crisis 






p— OT} 


ee i |) ee ee Bee, ee Ce i -  D eee ae 





to incorporate all castes and colors in 
one body politic on a footing of abso- 
lute equality.” At the beginning of 
the 18th Century when Pombal 
worked, the Negroes formed a large 
part of the population of Pernambuco 
and Bahia: 

“The black population there. was 
then so numerous that travelers. said 
one might imagine himself in Negro- 
land; Frezier estimated the proportion 
of blacks to whites at twenty to one; 
Vieyra says that in the city of Sao Sal- 
vador alone twenty-five thousand Ne- 
groes were catechized and instructed 
in the Angolan tongue, besides a much 
larger number outside the city. It is 
safe to say that in 1700 Bahia had 
ten times as many Negro slaves as 
Virginia.” 

But, as Mr. Nash says: 

“The Portuguese are more color- 
blind than any other people in Europe. 
They are so color-blind that they will 
look straight at a black man and ‘see 
only a man. They share this peculiar 
optical defect with the French, Span- 
ish, Italians, Jews, and Syrians; but 
with the Portuguese it is developed to 
a noteworthy degree.” 

The chances for emancipation, es- 
pecially for mulattoes, were large in 
Brazil, even from the beginning. 

“So from the first in Brazil we have 
to distinguish between a black current 
flowing into the stinking cesspool of 
bondage and another current, not quite 
so black, trickling away to join the 
waters that purled down the rapids to- 
ward réal freedom. Far be it from 
me to make light of the horrors that 
floated on the first, even under the 
best conditions. Each hardy bag of 
leather-covered bones that survived to 
reach Brazil gazed four times, on the 
average, upon the death of a kinsman 
before his own skinny body was landed 
in beautiful Rio de Janeiro or the Bay 
of All the Saints... . 

“Men have never been subjected to 
a more rigorous physical selection; the 
black slave who arrived in America 
proved his exceptional physical fitness 
by the fact that he could walk down 
the gangplank. It was the filthiest in- 
stitution that has ever won the enthu- 
siasm of large masses of men. Never- 
theless, Negro slavery in Brazil was 
not so bad as in Dutch Guiana, the 
British West Indies, or the United 
States; the black Army of Labor that 
answered the summons of the Portu- 
guese recruiting sergeants took up po- 
— which were not altogether hope- 
ess.” 


EGROES fought in the Brazilian 
armies back in the 18th century, 

but as Mr. Nash points out: 
“There was very little in Portuguese 
law and much less in Brazilian public 


April, 1927 


opinion to degrade either Caribocas, 
Mulattoes, or free Negroes. At the 
beginning of the eighteenth century 
there were prohibitions against colored 
people holding positions of public trust, 
but before the end of the century we 
encounter not only black clergy in Bra- 
zil but even black Bishops.” 

The result was that the proportion 
of free Negroes in Brazil was very 
large. By the beginning of the 19th 
Century there were véry nearly as 
many free Negroes as slaves. Slavery 
was not officially abolished until 1888. 
Lincoln freed four million slaves and 
Brazil two million. But the four mil- 
lion was a much smaller proportion of 
the total population of the United 
States than the two million was in 


where fusion of Europeans and Afri- 
cans is going on unchecked by law or 
custom. More than in any other place 
in the world, readmixture of the most 
divergent types of humanity is there 
injecting meaning into the ‘égalité’ 
of Revolutionary France and the ‘hu- 
man solidarity’ of philosophers and 
class-conscious proletarians. Destiny 
has erected in Brazil a social labora- 
tory which shall reveal the significance 
of ‘race’ and either confirm or give 
the lie for all time to the superstition 
that the admixture of widely different 
stocks spells degeneration. 

“Tf the Brazilian experiment in un- 
conscious brotherhood fail, those who 
view with alarm the ‘rising tide of 
color’ and see a ‘yellow peril’ gather- 





Brazil. 


In the United States slavery 
lasted two hundred forty-four years; 
in Brazil three hundred fifty-six. 


What was the result? Fusion, in- 
termarriage, intermingling of blood on 
such a scale that practically all pre- 
vious white writers on Brazil have 
been silent or vaguely allusive. Mr. 
Nash is frank and definite: 

“Portuguese, Negroes and Indians, 
with a nineteenth century increment 
of Mediterranean peoples, Central Eu- 
ropeans and Asiatics have fused into 
a nation of Brazilians thirty million 
strong. Pombal’s vision of a people 
who shall rise above race hatred and 
caste and color has come true. Ex- 
cept the Portuguese colonies in Africa, 
Brazil is the one country in the world 


ing in the Orient, will consider that 
failure an overwhelming vote of con- 
fidence in their thesis. If, on the con- 
trary, Brazil goes on to develop the 
finest civilization which ever flourished 
in a warm climate, a civilization pow- 
erful enough to enable her to sit on 
the bench of equality beside the Pow- 
ers of the temperate zone that now 
proclaim themselves Lords of Creation, 
an increasing conviction will, in time, 
lay hold of the human mind that the 
mating of the most diverse strains of 
men is no more disastrous than the 
mingling of the streams that form a 
mighty river. Brown currents, dark 
waters and white unite to make the 
Amazor; all the rivers of the world

HERE is given below the audit 

of the finances of the N. A. A. 

C. P. and THe Crisis, made by 
W. C. Heaton and Company, Certi- 
fied Public Accountants of New York 
City, for the year ending December 31, 
1926. 

It will be noted that there was in 
the Legal Defense Fund at the close 
of the year a total of $37,581.52; of 
this amount $10,060.27 being in in- 
terest-bearing saving accounts and $27,- 
521.25 in listed railroad bonds which 
bring a maximum interest return 
coupled with security and negotiability. 
The Legal Defense Fund is a trust 
fund to be expended only in legal de- 
fense cases coming clearly within the 
scope of the Association’s activities. 
No part of it can be used for any other 
purpose. The present sum is what 
remains of the amount raised through 
the appeal of the N. A. A. C. P. to the 
country a* large for a fund to fight 
the Sweet Cases in Detroit and resi- 
dential segregation cases testing the 
validity of property holders’ covenants 
in debarring Negroes from owning and 
occupying property, the Texas “white 
primary” cases and other litigation in 
defense of the Negro’s citizenship 
rights. 

The generous response to the Asso- 
ciation’s appeal for a Legal Defense 
Fund, however, limited its resources in 
other departments. The operating ex- 
penses such as administrative, publicity, 
field, stenographic and clerical salaries ; 
rent; printing; postage; traveling ex- 
penses and such necessary charges are 
paid from the General Fund. Many 
friends of the Association contributed 
to the Legal Defense Fund and were 
unable to renew their memberships 
which go into the General Fund. 
Thus there was a net loss for the year 
in the General Fund, though the Asso- 
ciation ended the year with more money 
in hand in all funds than in any pre- 
vious year. The National Office and 
the Branches are emphasizing the 
Spring membership campaigns to wipe 
out this deficit in the General Fund. 

This report of the Certified Public 
Accountants, in addition to the regular 
examination of the accounts of the As- 
sociation and Tue Crisis which is 
made each year, contains the audit of 
Tue Crisis School Survey Fund. It 
will be remembered that the American 
Fund for Public Service (more gener- 
ally known as The Garland Fund) 
gave to THE Crisis the sum of $5,000 
for a studv of education and educa- 
tional facilities for Negroes in certain 
Southern states. The results of the 
surveys in Georgia and Mississippi have

GENTLEMEN: 

Our examination of the accounting 
records of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED 
PrEopLE—GENERAL DEPARTMENT has 
been completed for:the year ended De- 
cember 31, 1926. In connection there- 
with we have prepared and submit 
herewith the following financial state- 
ments : 

Exhibit A—Balance Sheet, Decem- 
ber 31, 1926. 

Exhibit B—Statement of Income 
and Expenses (Exclusive of Special 
Funds) for the Year Ended Decem- 
ber 31, 1926. 

Exhibit C—Summary Statement of 
Special Funds for the Year Ended De- 
cember 31, 1926. 

While a detailed audit of the ac- 
counts was not made, extensive tests 
were applied to determine, the correct- 


ness and accuracy of the various entries. 


We have made the usual verification of 
balance sheet items. 

There has been a decided shift in 
asset and liability items during the year, 
as reflected in the condensed compara- 
tive balance sheets at December 31, 


1926 and 1925, shown below:

It was noted that there were minor 
expenses amounting to less than 





$200.00 applicable to the year 1926, 
which were not entered in the books 
before closing. On the other hand, 
there was interest on bank accounts 
amounting to about the same figure, 
which also had not been entered in the 
books before closing. We have not 
asked that the books be adjusted for 
these small amounts, and the sstate- 
ments presented herewith are in accord 
with the books. 

In our opinion the appended balance 
sheet and statement of income and ex- 
penses state, with substantial accuracy, 
the financial. position of the General 
Department of the National Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People at December 31, 1926, and the 
financial operations for the year then 


ended.

The True American 


By JOHN STRONG 
AMERICA, here is your son, born of 


your iron heel, 

Black blood and red and white contend 
along this frame of steel. 

The thorns deep in his brow are set and 
yet he does not cower, 

He goes with neither fears nor tears to 
crucifixion hour. 

Nor yet does hatred blur ‘his view of 
mankind’s frail parade, 

From his commanding triple coign, all 
prejudices fade. 

The ebbing nations coalesce in him and 
flow as one, 

The bright shining rainbow sweeping 
back to God at set of sun! 

Mark well the surety of tread, the new 
song high in air, 

The new note in the nation’s throat, as 
permanent as prayer. 

America, regard your son, The Cosmo- 
politan, 

The pattern of posterity, The True 
American. 


Bluebird 


By EFFIE LEE NEWSOME 


| JUST heard your soft smothered voice 
today ! 

I’m sure you'll flit on in your light- 
winged way, 

Unmindful, undreaming of me, 

Who have not yet seen you in blue and 
brown, 

But just heard your lush notes drip 
down, drip down 

As showers from the black ash tree.

eo ae taught me to believe that God 


is W hite, 
That merit is alone found in this hue, 
But since calm hours attend the darkest 
night 
- Why should I still believe such doctrine 
true? 


They taught me that the angels are like 
snow, 

That colors save their white all virtues 
lack, 

But gazing on a swarthy sleeping babe 

Makes me believe that angels too are 
black.

@ Arna Bontemps, whose poem, “A 
Nocturne at Bethesda”, received first 
prize in THe Crisis contest for 1926, 
writes: “It is not hard to furnish the 
notes of my biography. They are, as 
I remember them, few and unimpor- 
tant. I am a Californian, born in 
Louisiana and living in New York 
City. In spite of irregularity in at- 
tending school I contrived to secure a 
degree of B. A. from one of the smaller 
California colleges in my twentieth 
year. About that time I found out 
that the writing of poetry is both im- 
moral and vicious and out of my inher- 
ent integrity burned all my earlier 
efforts. Upon this same scene I deter- 
mined never to write any more of it 
but rather to henceforth devote my 
youth and manhood to prose. How- 
ever, neither of these resolutions have 
I kept. I am at present a teacher in a 
private school. That’s all.” 


Whose fickle buds 

Bear twelve manner of fruit, 

And whose leaves are for an healing 
To the nations. 

It grows with the bitter wormwood 
On either side 

The throbbing river of the soul, 

This tree, 


Whose name is Love. 





“Is heard of storm-hushed robins.

Portrait of an Old Woman 


By F. MARSHALL DAVIS 


EATHER skin of a tom-tom 
stretched loosely 
over dried marrowless bones 
then painted with a brown 
the color of parched corn 
old and bent 
like the hands 
of the town clock 
at two minutes past six 
eyes the color of 
weatherbeaten brown calico 
and with just that much brilliance 
born working 
will go out the same way 
she had a son 
he is now doing time 
at Leavenworth 
for bootlegcing 
her tomorrow 
is like her today 
yet she can sing 
of a Saviour Jesus 
who washed away 
the sins of the world 
and left her white as snow 
of a rest that will come in 
the Great Beyond. 
What a tragedy it would be 
if she were mistaken. 


After the Storm 
By STERLING BROWN 


“THERE i is pathetic beauty in it all; 
O’erhead the murky, sullen rain- 
clouds pass, 
The sun’s first darting rays have 
pierced the mass, 
Just now . grim, so gray. Again the 
ca 


-Ma- 
ples tall, 
To show the regal silver of their 
class, 


Rustle their thirst-slaked leaves and 
on the grass, 
Drenched into higher colog, some last 
drops fall. 


’Tis like that heart, whose happiness ex- 
celled 
All others, which, with 
threshold crossed 
At last by sorrow’s gloom, has 
fitly learned 
To stifle throes of pain, has ne’er re- 


its gay 


belled 
In angry bitterness, has merely 
turned 
~ee to pathos, with no beauty 
ost.

April, 1927 49 





The Little Page 


Calendar Chat 


HERE is a quaint old saying that 

wher cose is talking of a person 
the ears of the person discussed “‘must 
be burning”. If I were to talk long of 
April there are hosts of modest little 
wild flowers in the woods that would 
“feel their ears burning’. For they 
form a very important part of April. 

Blue Violet, for instance, with its 
short stem and softly bowed head; 
Liverwort colored in the daintiest of 
rose and lavender and blue; Trillium 
or Wake-robin in its chalky white 
against the damp dark spring earth; 
Spring Beauty palely pink or as white 
as snow except for the faintest of crim- 
son lines; Dogwood with its milky 
petals spread wide on boughs that look 
brittle and wet and black—all these 
blossoms of April could conclude that 
I spoke of them in connection with the 
month to which they bring their fresh 
early beauty. 

And think of the hosts of birds that 
belong also to April’s display. Some of 
them are so modest that I almost hate 
to mention their names; for instance, 
Bluebird as retiring as Blue Violet! 
But it isn’t fair to keep you indoors 
reading of these wonders when you 
should be out-of-doors and with them 


all! 


Till 3:33, 
HERE once was a rabbit 
Who formed the wild habit 
Of running away! 
By highland or lowland 
By dry land or snow land 
He went every day, 
With scarcely once stopping, 
A-jumping and hopping, 
He just could not stay. 


At length he was found, 
One time, by a hound, 
But somehow got free. 
He fied like a swallow 
Right into the hollow 
Of quite a large tree. 
With all of his might 
He stayed out of sight 
Till 3:33. 


Jonquil and Goldfish 


H, the goldfish sparkled and flash- 

ed that day! I can never forget 
how miserable I felt in contrast—I, a 
rusty bronze jonquil bulb from Japan. 
I sat in a clay pot with pebbles piled 
around me. Some one had placed the 
pot beside the goldfish.

Mh 


He occupied a bowl of clearest glass 
and within the bowl was a tiny rock 
castle with arches and turrets that were 
swept by fringes of seaweed. The sun- 
rise-colored fish, his white chiffon tail 
rippling on the water, went round and 
round within the bowl and I imagined 
that he gazed through the glass with 
scornful curiosity whenever he faced 
me. 


Not only was I ugly. I was, more- 
over, foreign born. And I am certain 
the goldfish had forgotten that the first 
goldfish came from China—perches 
dyed with Cayenne pepper! 

One day I poked up a stiff green and 
white thumb from the pebbles. I saw 
the round eyes of the goldfish peeping 
out in wonder. Every day I pushed the 
thumb upward higher. And then I let 
it become many tender green fingers. 
Still the goldfish floated about and 


watched me. 


The tender green fingers I changed 
into green ribbons. The goldfish saw

this. Then one night—perhaps the 
fish was sleeping at that time—I used 
the green sprays for a net and caught 
the tiniest stars possible, the smallest 
and whitest stars of all. In the morn- 
ing the goldfish’s eyes seemed to grow 
rounder. , 

I was “in bloom” as people would 
have expressed it. Furthermore, had I 
shaken one of my dainty flowerets into 
the aquarium below, the water would 
have become perfumed, so rich were the 
blossoms with fragrance. 

“Oh, good!’, cried someone who 
must have been the person who set me 
in the pot when I was too much of a 
bulb to know. “Here is my jonquil in 
full bloom the day before Easter.” 

She was so happy that she forgot to 
give the goldfish his flaky breakfast. 
She ran away and returned with three 
other persons who had high pitched 
voices like hers and they spoke in great 
surprise, as though it were marvelous 
for a bulb to become a flower. Or per-

MUSIC AND ART 


@ The present tour of the Fisk Ju- 
bilee Singers has been overwhelmingly 
successful. They have sung their oper- 
atic numbers and Negro Spirituals in 
Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, 
Italy, Spain and England. 

@ The graduating class of Tuskegee 
Institute recently presented a brilliant 
musical pageant depicting the race’s 
suffering and deliverance from slavery. 
The spirituals used in this presentation 
were arranged by John C. Wright. 

@ The unusual story of a blind man, 
Edward E. Steele, a native of Ports- 
mouth, Virginia, now living in New 
York City, is of great interest and sig- 
nificance to the race. He has struggled 
against almost insurmountable odds to 
his present position as a popular and 
successful radio performer. 

@ Mendelssohn’s “Elijah”, which will 
be presented by the Pilgrim Baptist 
Temple Choir of one hundred voices, 
accompanied by a symphony orchestra 
of thirty-five pieces is being given in 
Chicago late in April. James A. 
Mundy, who is well known in musical 
circles throughout the United States, 
will direct the Oratorio which includes 
among its members Barrington Guy 
of Washington, D. C., who will sing 
the title role of “Elijah”, Lucretia 
Mitchell, Maeme Etheridge and Lem- 
myon Amoureux. Zelma Watson, 
Mrs. Jone Trice, Professor Norton 
Dennis and Hazel Baily are accom- 
panists. 

@ George Garner, the Chicago opera 
tenor, sang at the Stoll, London, Eng- 
land, recently. 

@ Under the direction of R. Nathaniel 
Dett, the Hampton Institute choir 
sang at the Congressional Library,

Washington, D. C., recently. The in- 
terpretations of French and Russian 
folk songs, sixteenth and seventeenth 
century songs, English Christmas carols 
and a group of Negro spirituals, 
showed great ability and versatility. 


SOCIAL PROGRESS 

@ A fine, new garage valued at 
$100,000 has been opened by Harvey 
and Mozee of St. Louis, Missouri. 

@ A license to operate in New York 
State has been granted to the Victory 
Life Insurance Company of Chicago. 
@ A colored applicant for a position on 
the police force of Zanesville, Ohio, has 
been refused by the city administration 
although the applicant stood high on 


a 


ALONG THE COLOR LINE 








the civil service commission’s list of 
eligibles. 

@ A resolution passed by the Brother- 
hood of Sleeping Car Porters asks that 
the porters be given a sufficient wage 
so that the generally practiced tipping 
system will be unnecessary. 

@ The annual report from the Dix- 
well Community House, New Haven, 
Connecticut, is an indication of the 
lively interest taken in social service 
work. During the year 1926 the Kin- 
dergarten Department accommodated 
425 children; 5,201 girls and 6,080 
boys under sixteen years of age made 
use of the building; 2,912 women and 
4,743 men between the ages of seven- 
teen and twenty-one were in attend- 
ance in the different departments. 
There was a total combined attend- 
ance for the reading room, supervised 
study room, committee rooms and the 
Sunday Forum of 33,786. The Vis- 
iting Nurses’ Association clinics ac- 
commodated 1,119 patients. The to- 
tal attendance in all activities was 
67,040 which means that about 4,000 
people actually used the building. 

@ With a capital stock of $100,000, 
the Century Life Insurance Company, 
the first legal reserve life insurance 
company organized by Negroes west of 
the Mississippi, was incorporated at 
Little Rock, Arkansas, in November, 
1926. 

@ We have received the announce- 
ment of the William E. Harmon 
Awards for distinguished achievement 
among Negroes for 1927. Seven 
awards are open to American Negroes 
and the award in race relations is open 
to all Americans, white and colored. 
The awards will be presented on Feb- 
ruary 12, 1928.

@ The Liberian Government has pub- 
licly denied the statements which have 
been circulated to the effect that the 
American Negro is not wanted in 
Liberia. 

@ The Burrell Memorial Hospital, 
Roanoke, Virginia, was founded in 
1915 and is now one of the largest in- 
stitutions of its kind in the South 
owned and controlled by Negroes. The 
plant, which consists of a completely 
modern building and five acres of 
ground, is valued at between $85,000 
and $100,000. Connected with the 
hospital is a staff of five colored phy- 
sicians and a Nurses’ Training School 
accommodating fifteen girls. 


@ Rodman Wanamaker of Philadel- 


phia recently announced one thousand . 


dollars in prizes exclusively to Negro 
musical composers. The twenty-five 
prizes, divided into five classifications, 
range from a first prize of one hundred 
dollars in each classification, downward 
to ten dollars as the smallest prize in 
each group. This offer is being made 
through the Robert Curtis Ogden As- 
sociation, composed of the colored em- 
ployees of the John Wanamaker Store 
of Philadelphia in co-operation with 
the National Association of Negro 
Musicians. 


EDUCATION 
@ William Johnson Trent, the new 


Burrell Memorial Hospital, Roanoke, Virginia 


President of Livingstone College, Sal- 
isbury, North Carolina, was born in 
Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1873. 
He received his early training in the 
rural schools near Pineville, North 
Carolina, where he was brought up on 
the farm, and in the Episcopal School 
in his native city. In 1898 he received 
the B. A. degree from Livingstone Cok 


lege. The same institution conferred 
the M. A. degree upon him a few years 
later. President Trent has since done 
graduate work at the University of 
Chicago. He has served successfully as 
Y. M. C. A. Secretary in the Spanish 
American War, President of Green- 
ville College, Greenville, Tennessee, 
General Secretary of the Y. M. C. A.

ecutive Secretary of the Y. M. C. A. 
in Atlanta, Georgia. In Atlanta he 
erected the beautiful six-story Butler 
Street Y. M. C. A., which is the only 
Rosenwald building .in the entire 
South. Already, at the close of the 
first year under President Trerit’s ad- 
ministration, J.ivingstone College 
shows remarkable improvement. An 
excellent faculty is employed, number- 
ing among its ranks persons who have 
studied at Harvard, Chicago, Colum- 
bia, Indiana, Northwestern and other 
northern Universities. 

@ Livingstone College, Salisbury, 
North Carolina, the chief institution 
of the A. M. E. Zion Church, is now 
in ‘the midst of a financial campaign for 
$250,000 for equipment and enlarge- 
ment. Among the buildings to be 
erected will be an administration build- 
ing in honor of the first president, Dr. 
J. C. Price. The entire Board of 
Bishops in their recent meeting gave 
their endorsement to the campaign. 
Up to date, half of the amount has 
been subscribed. Already thousands of 
dollars have been spent for equipment 
in new science laboratories, in the pur- 
chase of the best of recent books for 
the library and in general equipment. 
Mr. B. N. Duke has given $25,000 
for endowment. The Slater Fund has 
decided to make a large annual dona- 
tion for teachers’ salaries and the State 
of North Carolina has given the Col- 
lege a higher rating for its educational 
work. The alumni and friends of edu- 
cation throughout the country are 
working hard to make this financial ef- 
fort a complete success. 

@ The State Department of Educa- 
tion recently notified President Bluford 
of the Agricultural and Technical Col- 
lege of North Carolina that the Col- 
lege has been placed in “A” class. 

@ Beginning next year the tuition of 
Fisk University will be raised and the 
high school department will be -sus- 
pended, President Thomas Elsa Jones 
announced recently. 

@ Tuskegee Institute is to receive one- 
third of the residue of the estate of the 
late Alice B. Jackson, which is ap- 
praised at $660,719. The bequest will 
be realized at the death of Percy Jack- 
son of New York City, who received a 
life interest in the estate.

the Machine Gun Troop, 9th U. S. 
Cavalry ; Gas Instructor ; Supervisor of 
the 9th Cavalry Educational: School 
while it was stationed in the Philip-

Tuskegeee Institute. He is now Pro- 
fessor of Military Science and Tactics 
at Lincoln University at Jefferson City, 
Missouri. 

@€ A. F. Owens, Dean of Theology, 
Selma University and instructor of col- 
ored preachers under the auspices of the 
Home Mission Board of the Southern 
Baptist Convention, recently published 
his forty-fifth annual report of the free 
dinners given in Mobile, Alabama, each 
holiday season. Mr. Owens instituted 
the custom of free feasts, to be given in- 


discriminately to both white and col- - 


ored, the day before Thanksgiving, 
1882, while he was serving on the jury. 
He asked that each juryman donate 
two dollars in order that the inmates 
of the County Asylum for the Poor 
might have a turkey dinner. ‘The pop- 
ularity of this custom may be estimated 
by its growth over a period of forty- 
five years. In 1926 there were twelve 
institutions which were the beneficiaries 
instead of one and there were two hun- 
dred subscribers instead of the original 
sixteen.

Rose McClendon 


OSE McCLENDON of New 

York has forged to the front in 
the last year as an actress. She writes 
us: 

“T cannot say that all my life I want- 
ed to act. I had seen so many things 
badly done in churches that I wanted 
always to teach children what to do and 
when to do it; so when the chance 
came to study under the late Franklin 
Sargent of the American Academy of 
Dramatic Arts, I jumped at it. I 
studied with him for three years and 
before I knew it I was doing one of 
the leading roles in Butler Davenport’s 
‘Justice’. Then came ‘Roseanne’, 
‘Deep River’ and now ‘In Abraham’s 


,») 


Bosom’. 


The press notices of her work in 
“Deep River”, particularly, have been 
unusually fine. Alexander Woollcott, 
the well-known critic of The World, 
writes: 

“In the third act of ‘Deep River’ 
when, for a moment, the vast stage was 
emptied and one heard only the mur- 
mur of unseen choruses, saw only the 
lazy tracery of the tree shadows upon 
the gray-green jalousies of the old New 
Orleans house, the door opened on the 
high balcony and down the winding 
stone steps came an aging mulatto ac- 
tress who played, in black taffeta and 
diamonds, the procuress of the quad- 
roon ball. She stood there for a mo- 
ment, serene, silent, queenly and I 
could think only of the lost loveliness 
that was Duse. The noble head, carved 
with pain, was Duse’s. 

“When ‘Deep River’ was having its 
trial flight in Philadelphia, Ethel 
Barrymore slipped in to snatch what 
moments she could of it. ‘Stay till the 
last act if you can,’ Arthur Hopkins 
whispered to her, ‘and watch Rose Mc- 
Clendon come. down those stairs. She 
can teach some of our most hoity-toity 
actresses distinction.’ 


“Tt was Miss Barrymore who hunted 
him up after the performance to say, 


>» 


‘She can teach them all distinction’. 


ILBERT W. GABRIEL writes 
in the New York Sun: 

“Deep River’ does riot succeed. But 
its very regretfulness over that flat fact 
is brightened by the memory. of some 
unforgettably lovely moments. That 
they are moments almost inconspicuous, 
unimportant to the main march of the 
piece, is most grievous of all.

African Civilization 

“African-Negro Civilizations” by 
Maurice Delafosse, the French writer, 
well merits attention. Translating the 
author’s words in the preface we find: 

“The object of this book is to estab- 
lish a sort of synthesis of that which is 
common to the ensemble of African 
Negro civilizations.” 

With this object in view Delafosse 
has set forth in a manner instructive 
and entertaining both the custom and 
the culture of the black African. He 
commences with their religion: ‘“mys- 
ticism” and “collectivisme” placed at 
the basis of all their manifestations, 
dominates the character of their civili- 
zation. No institution exists, social or 
political, that has not religion or a re- 
ligious concept as its basis. This re- 
ligion, rather than being termed “feti- 
cism” is called “animisme”. One un- 
derstands by this term the belief in the 
existence of souls. To the African, 
everything, living or dead, is endowed 
with a personality, a thought and a 
will. But it is a belief in the magic 
practice (magic being substituted for 
religion when the latter is in default) 
and not their true religion that hinders 
the progress of their mentality and in a 
great part causes the stagnant state of 
their civilization. 

Delafosse continues by giving us an 
insight into the social and political or- 
ganizations of the African. The basis 
of both is the family. The life of a 
child, the clan, the castes of society are 
vividly portrayed. One learns the fu- 
neral and the marriage laws. It is in- 
teresting to note that polygamy often 
results from the demand of a wife who 
wishes a second wife to relieve her of 
her strenuous housework. 

“The blacks have a conception of 
ownership similar to our own”, writes 
Delafosse, “except for the land which is 
based on a religious belief.” One of 
their proverbs states: 

“It is not man who possesses the 
earth, it is the earth who possesses the 
man.” Hence man is simply the life 
“tenant”. 

Delafosse ends his account by show- 
ing to what extent the intellectual and 
artistic nature of the African is devel- 
oped. In literature, art and music, the 
African is classed as a true artist.

says the “New Negro Takes Another 
Step”. This article is a brief and fair 
survey of the organization of the Broth- 
erhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which 
under the intelligent guidance of A. 
Philip Randolph in less than two years 
has taken a tremendous foothold on 
colored United States. In _present- 
ing its case to the United States 
Mediation Board, the Brotherhood is 
asking for a minimum wage of $150 
a month, the abolition of the tipping

system, a working month of 240 hours 
and legislation against doubling. Mr. 
Gibson exposes the method by which 
the Pullman Company influenced the 
editorial policy of certain Negro papers. 

In the same issue, an interesting re- 
port of a recent college Y. M. C. A. 
and Y. W. C. A. conference of 2500 
delegates is discussed under the title of 
“Building Tomorrow’s World”. That 
they are willing to give to the members 
of every race the same opportunities 
that they have, was met with almost 
unanimous approval. Eleven students 
voted that they regard some races in- 
herently inferior to their own and that 
they favor keeping them in their places. 
Over six hundred declared that they 
will deny to no race any privilege that 
they claim as their own and thirty-five 
were not ready to commit themselves. 

“The whole racial discussion today is 
confused and clouded by much pseudo-

scientific talk of ‘superior races’,” de- 
clares M. Ashby Jones in commenting 
upon “The Negro and the South” in 
the January issue of the Virginia Quar- 
terly. There has been little effort at 
clear definition of what is meant by 
“superior”. That there is a vast dif- 
ference in the attainments and achieve- 
ments of races is readily granted. 
This does not mean that the more back- 
ward peoples might not show superior 
accomplishments under different envir- 
onments and along different lines of 
endeavor. 

We have more discussion of “dark 
Africa” in The Nation for February 
9. Lord Oliver, in discussing “A New 
Slavery in South Africa”, clearly de- 
fines the fallacy of attempting to main- 
tain the repressionist and color-bar pol- 
icy. He says in conclusion: “The na- 
tive is at present desirous and disposed 
to adapt himself to the life of European 
civilization; and if white men worthy 
of that civilization continue to assist 
him to do so, South African society will 
develop on stable lines.” 

In connection with the foregoing ar- 
ticle, the same issue of The Nation car- 
ries an article on “The South African 
Color Problem” by R. F. Alfred 
Hoernle. The proposed laws, which 
on interpretation are laws with a view 
to arresting any economic or social de- 
velopments which are a menace to 
= supremacy, are discussed in de- 
tail. 

Anyone who was not in a position to 
see the Blondiau-Theatre Arts Collec- 
tion of primitive Congo art, displayed 
recently in New York City, will be 
interested in the illustrated article on 
“Art Lessons from the Congo” by 
Alain Locke, in the February Survey 
Graphic. In his own pictorial way, 
Mr. Locke, in a brief space, explains 
that this unique collection is representa- 
tive Congo work and is indicative of 
African life and culture.

VICTORY 

The United States Supreme Court 
by unanimous decision, March 7, 
1927, declared “that the Fourteenth 
Amendment not only gave citizenship 
and the privileges of citizenship to per- 
sons of color, but it denied to any State 
the power to withhold from them the 
equal protection of the laws. _” 

“What is this but declaring that the 
law in the States shall be the same for 
the black as for the white, that all 
persons, whether colored or white, shall 
stand equal before the laws of the 
States, and, in regard to the colored 
race, for whose protection the amend- 
ment was primarily designed, that no 
discrimination shall be made against 
‘them by law because of their color?” 


SOCIAL EQUALITY 


You see, what so many people forget 
—or often honestly do not realize—is 
that there are all kinds of Negroes pleas- 
ant and unpleasant, educated and igno- 
rant, sensitive and coarse, high minded 
and bestial. In both white and Negro 
races there are bigots and in both races 
there are men and women of wide vision. 
But, unfortunately, the moment the word 
Negro is mentioned many think instantly 
—not of the highest type of that gifted 
race or even of its many earnest and 
estimable mediocre exponents, but of the 
very lowest and most shiftless type of 
Negro, or if not of the very lowest type, 
then of the type vaudeville and minstrel 
shows have stylized. , 


Of course, you don’t wish to eat with 
that type, nor do I. Of course I don’t 
wish that sort of man (black or white) 
dancing with my daughter. (My elder 
one, Josephine, is sixteen, very charm- 
ing, and very popular indeed with her 
contemporaries. Youths buzz about her 
like proverbial bees about a flower.) 
But if Josephine, or later, Alice, were 
to attend Ann Arbor and the inter-racial 
club there should give a banquet or a 
dance (and why it shouldn’t do both I 
cannot imagine), I am sure either of 
my daughters could both dine and dance 
with as much grace and dignity and as 
little self-consciousness with any of the 
club’s Negro members as with any of its 
white members. 


My children always have gone to 
school with colored children and accept 
them as simply as they do their white 
classmates. At noon, those who take 
their dinners—white and colored, boys 
and girls—eat together, as a matter of 
course, all in an informal semi-circle in 
one room under the supervision of one 
teacher. There is absolutely no race 
consciousness among the children. There 
never is any natural spontaneous race

THE FAR HORIZON 





antipathy between children. They ac- 
quire it only after it has been ding- 
donged into them by prejudiced elders. 
Then often the lesson is only too thor- 
oughly absorbed. And, o course, inten- 
sified, with all the force of tradition 
generation. 

But do you think these same children 
who have just finished lunch side by side 
could go to any of our ice-cream parlors 
and get a soda or a sundae together? 
No, it would be too much for the sen- 
sibilities of the adult white people. 
Really, it is laughable—the utter illogic 
of it. Or rather it would be if the ulti- 
mate result were not so grim and often 
tragic. 

By the same token I know white 
mothers who are perfectly willing to 
have colored nursemaids to help them 
care for their children during the latter’s 
most tender and impressionable years, 
but are scandalized at the idea of colored 
teachers in the public schools. Accord- 
ing to them it is quite all right for a 
child of four or five to be put under the 
influence of a mediocre and frequently 
rather undesirable type of colored girl, 
but quite horrifying for an older child 
to be carefully taught by a thoroughly 
prepared, well-educated, finer type of 
Negro. I fail to see either the good sense 
or logic of such an attitude. Even more 
untenable is the position of those who 
prefer colored maids in’a household, but 
resent the idea of colored stenographers 
or of colored trained nurses. 


The more mediocre types of Negroes 
are not going to be any happier in the so- 
ciety of intellectual white folk than medi- 
ocre white people will be in the society 
of intellectual Negroes. (I wonder if 
you realize how often an article you like 
or poem which appeals to you in one of 
the best magazines is written by a Ne- 
gro?) It is so obvious a platitude that 
I quite blush to present it—but surely 
there is no denying that like draws like. 
The sort of colored person who would 
dine in a first-class restaurant, go to a 
first-class theater, prefer to travel in a 
Pullman, is scarcely going to be less man- 
nered or less correctly dressed and gen- 
erally accepted than the same type of 
white perso.

THE WEST INDIAN IN 
PANAMA 


That Panama has developed is a fact. 
Whereas, at one time, twenty years ago, 
she was a nation in name only and was 
hardly perceivable on the map of Central 
America, to-day, she is the principal 
gateway of the Americans and boasts 
of the possession of supreme jurisdiction 
within her borders which she exercises. 
She has her National Flag, Anthem and 


her Coat of Arms on which is inscribed 
the motto Pro Mundi Beneficio and 
in this.connection she claims to exist for 
the benefit of all humanity and well 
might she. 


And this is only as it should be, be- 
cause, in her development, various peo- 
ples have played a prominent part and 
if the part they played has been faith- 
fully recorded, the aggregate of them 
would exclude very few of the peoples 
of the world. As far back as forty 
years ago, the West Indian migrated to 
Panama. At that time, the present de- 
veloped Panama was under the sover- 
eignty of Columbia and in her struggles 
for independence, the West Indian con- 
tributed his share in sentiment and ac- 
tually fought whenever there was a fight 
in a true hearted and loyal manner. 


By example and precept, the West 
Indian has contributed to the Agricul- 
tural development of Panama, on a small 
scale at first, but what with the advent 
of such concerns as the United Fruit 
Company, the Sand Blast Development 
Company and others, ninety-five per cent 
of whose laborers are West Indians, 
Panama’s development in Agriculture 
has been established and assured. 

West Indians have also. contributed 
to the marvelous change of custom in 
Civic life, in apparel and in the various 
kinds of past times. 


_And now we come to the West In- 
dian’s greatest contribution to the devel- 
opment of Panama. We speak of the 
Panama Canal. 


In the construction of the Canal and 
its adjuncts, the West Indian has played 
his part. He has given his contribution 
in brain and brawn. West Indian lives 
have been snuffed out while so engaged 
by accidents and misadventures, which 
are always attendant upon activities of 
such magnitude. The physical fitness of 
others has been reduced to physical un- 
fitness, decay and death and the place 
that knew them then, knew them no 
more forever. The greatest number of 
Clerks, Timekeepers, Checkers, Artisans, 
Laborers used in the construction of the 
Panama Canal were always West In- 
dians. They always recommended them- 
selves to the various powers that be (for 
various they were) as reliable workers, 
efficient, trustworthy, faithful to duty 
and always abounding in the qualities 
which gained for them the approbation 
by General Chester Harding, one of the 
Governors of the Panama Canal that, 
“THE WEST INDIAN LABORER 
HAS PROVED HIMSELF TO BE 
THE MOST IDEAL FOR THE 
CANAL”, expression to the contrary by 
the mischievous Metal Trades Council 
and a handful of jealous Panamanians, 
notwithstanding.

NORTH AND SOUTH 
CAROLINA 


The High Point, North Carolina 
Enterprise, a white journal, has this 
editorial! 


The manners of the president of the 
North Carolina College for Negroes, at 
Durham, were an issue last night in the 
legislature of North Carolina. A bill 
had been introduced to take the college 
out of the hands of the state school board 
and turn its regulation over to a board 
of directors. 

The college also is asking for $200,- 
000. “Mr. Speaker,” said Mr. Moss, 
Nash, “I oppose it also for a personal 
reason. As I rode up in the elevator the 
other day, I noticed its president rode up 
with his hat on although it was filled 
with white men.” 

Proving that he was not merely face- 
tious, Representative Moss sought to 
send the bill to a committee, consignment 
to which would amount almost to tabling 
it. Of course the bill was sent to the 
right committee and it is doubtful 
whether the house contains another per- 
son who thinks that the State’s attitude 
toward an appropriation for the educa- 
tion of Negroes should depend upon the 
servility of the Negro in charge of the 
institution but Mr. Moss has made his 
impression. He is in the record. 


The Greensboro News adds: 


There is no reason to think that the 
house paid any attention <o the remark. 
It is certainly not characteristic of North 
Carolina legislatures of the past and 
ought not to be characteristic of this 
legislature. But the fact that even one 
representative could have been found to 
give birth to this gem of racial snobbish- 
ness ought to make his colleagues blush 
from the top of their collective. Anglo- 
Saxon heads to the soles of their Nordic 
feet. 


Meanwhile in darkest South Caro- 
lina there is a heavy debate in the legis- 
lature on a measure to prevent colored 
barbers from cutting white women’s 
hair! 

When the measure was reached on the 
call of the calendar, the author of the 
measure, W. Claude Martin of Orange- 
burg, made a motion that unfavorable 
majority report made on it by the judi- 
ciary committee be tabled. This motion 
prevailed. 

“T believe in preventing crime,” Sen- 
ator Martin said, in speaking in defense 
of the bill. “A fad has developed among 
women in recent years which necessitates 
their visiting barber shops—many of them 
are waited on by Negro barbers. I see 
no reason why this practice should not be 
prohibited. The bill before you is prac- 
tically a copy of the Atlanta ordinance. 

“The president of the Federation of 
Women’s Clubs tells me she thinks the 
bill ought to pass. Pass the measure and 
cut off a wave that might lead to crim- 
inal assault—with a recurrence of a 
tragedy similar to that of Aiken county. 
The bill is fair to both races.” 

Senator Taylor H. Stukes of Claren- 
don objected to the passage of the bill. 


58 


“In my section,” he said, “white men own 
and operate barber shops and employ 
Negro barbers—sometimes girls and wo- 
men wait for sometime in order to get 
one Negro barber, who has been em- 
ployed in the town some 20 years. 

“There is no reason to interfere with 
the barber business. This bill merely ex- 
presses a tendency of the government of 
today—a tendency to regulate individ- 
uals in their private businesses. I’m 
against this endless regulation of the pri- 
vate activities of man.” 

“Only in recent years,” said Senator S. 
J. Summers of Calhoun, “have women 
taken to clipping their flowing locks. 
The time has come when, if women do 
not exercise discretion, we as the heads of 
families and as admirers of true woman- 
hood, should put restrictions around cer- 
tain businesses to protect the women. 

“T don’t believe a Negro barber has a 
right to cut the hair of a white woman 
though I am a friend of the Negro.” 

“Does this bill,” inquired Senator D. 
A. Spivey of Horry, “regulate boot- 
blacks? Does it prohibit a Negro boot- 
black from shining the shoes of a white 
woman or white girl?” 

“The bill does not prohibit Negroes 
from shining the shoes of white women,” 
Senator Martin replied. 

“Well, it seems to me that that is a 
more dangerous business than cutting 
hair,” the Horry senator remarked. 


* * * 


The measure classifies barber shops 
into four groups: Class_1, shops where 
white persons are barbers and only 
white persons served; Class 2, shops 
where white and Negro barbers are em- 
ployed, only white persons being served 
and white women and white girls to be 
waited on by white barbers; Class 3, 
shops where Negroes only are ft. «bers 
and where only white men shail be 
served; Class 4, shops where only Ne- 
groes are barbers and where only Ne- 
groes are served. 

Violators of the terms of the bill would 
be subject to a fine of not more than $100 
or imprisonment of not more than 30 
days. 


The Columbia State remarks: 


Have those members of the General 
Assembly who would have Negro bar- 
bers prohibited from cutting the hair of 
white women ever heard the proverb 
that it is well to “let sleeping dogs lie”? 

In this state are industries employing 
whites by thousands, from which Negroes 
are excluded—from which they ought to 


be excluded. The exclusion is effective, 


without the assistance of statutes. 

Would members of the General As- 
sembly have these conditions agitated? 
Do they want to see the Negro associa- 
tions of Northern states, backed by the 
money of a small element of wealthy 
Northern white men, to resort’ to the 
federal courts? 

Would these members have Negro bar- 
bers appealing to their Northern friends 
to interfere lest they be injured in their 
trades? 

Why monkey with the federal con- 


stitution, when the occasion is not urgent, 
when no emergency exists? 

The Negro in industry creates a del- 
icate, a complex situation. Most of the 
graver problems are solved without re- 
sort to statutes. The primary system of 
Texas is under attack even now, be- 
cause a Texas statute was enacted ex- 
cluding Negroes from Democratic pri- 
maries. We exclude them without the 
statute—and our position, therefore, is 
unassailable. 

Tinkering with the question of the 
Negro in industry might start discussions 
that would end in upheaval. 

Trouble that the “barbers’ bill’, if 
passed, might set on foot would begin 
in the North—and come South. 

Who wants disturbance? Kindling a 


little fire is one thing. Putting it out is 
another. 

“We exclude them without the stat- 
Why monkey with the Consti- 


ute!” 
tution! 


PHYSICIANS, HO! 
A Bermuda, B. W. 


makes this call: 


Here, of late, the growing need for 
more doctors in the island has been 
very forcibly borne in on us. Many 
cases of illness that could quite easily be 
looked after at home with a general 
practitioner in attendance is now rushed 
off to the Hospital because the doctors 
find it impossible to pay the necessary 
visits. 

Even the supplying of a district nurse 
would help but little, for the reason that 
a trained nurse seldom acts on her own 
initiative, except in rare cases and sim- 
ply carries out the daily instructions of 
the doctor. 

The need for these nurses is not to be 
decried, but the greater need is for the 
doctor; the Nurse is the adjunct, a nec- 
essary one all will admit, but without the 
doctor first, things will remain very 
much as they are and patients still sent 
to the hospital when their cases do not 
require it. Hence, we come back to the 
cry for “More doctors for Bermuda”. 

A private letter adds: 

I would like to say, that as Bermuda 
has a shortage of Physicians and Sur- 
geons and the population fast increasing. 
This clipping would mean an opportunity 
for colored American Doctors to practise 
in this beautiful island. There are also 
big opportunities for various business 
enterprises. 


ENGLISH SOCIALISTS 


The spirit of Wilberforce and 
Sharpe still strives in England. The 
report of the Independent Labor Par- 
tv’s Empire Policy Committee begins 
as follows: 

The policy which Socialism would 
adopt in relation to Empire problems in- 
volves a complete break with many past 
traditions. To quote the I.L.P. con- 
stitution, “Socialism is an Interna- 
tional Movement. It recognizes that

THE OUTER POCKET 





It had been my intention to write 
you prior to the last meeting of the 
executive board of the N. A. A. C. P. 

and urge that the 
N. A. A.C. P. country-wide interest 
and Labor your organization has 

in the labor move- 
ment be taken up and crystallized into 
some definite type of program. 

My desire to do this has been 
prompted by the sum total of my ex- 
periences, which have led me to the 
conclusion that the bringing about of 
equal economic opportunities is one of 
the biggest problems facing our group 
today, and that there is needed a strong 
and effective organization such as you 
have to champion the fight against dis- 
crimination in wages, lines of employ- 
ment and vocational opportunities. 

For several years I have not only 
been a labor organization man, but 
have tried to evork with various or- 
ganizations in communities in which I 
have lived to help equalize the salaries 
and opportunities of colored and white 
men and women. For more than eight 
years | was a secretary of the National 
Urban League, and since I have been 
on the staffof the Afro-American here, 
I have been a member of the City 
Council of the American Federation of 
Labor, and a member of one of the 
locals, but I am fully convinced that, 
if the fight for equal opportunities is 
te materialize in practical results, it 
must be handled by some strong or- 
ganization experienced in fighting these 
kinds of battles and which can do so 
unaffected by any of the various influ- 
ences that might be exerted by any one 
directly or indirectly upon it. 

I simply want to call your attention 
to this fact, because I believe it is one 
of the things that the N. A. A. C. P. 
will have to give serious consideration 
as it effectively brings about other types 
of equality. I believe an industrial de- 
partment with an aggressive program 
would greatly augment the work of the 
organization, and, what is more im- 
portant, would link it up and give it 
local status beyond that that any other 
of its activities have done. The ques- 
tion of labor, wages and working con- 
ditions is one about which local units 
could be more successfully built.

I enjoy reading everything in THE 


Crisis, with one exception. ‘The so- 
called “prize stories” I pass up. I am

puzzled to know why 
“Prize Stories” young authors of to- 

day can find nothing 
along the lines of decency in the race, to 
write about. The situations in both 
“The Yaller Gal” and “The Death 
Game” are deplorable, and not what I 
would want to continue to read as good 
literature. If there was any moral les- 
son or philosophy contained I would 
uphold them. With all the beautiful 
Negro women, old and young, seems 
there ought to be one at least worthy 
to inspire the higher ideals of life; 
just for a change please select some- 
thing of this type. This is not my 
opinion alone, but numerous readers 
are tired of these rotten effusions.—

The fact that my cousin, Judge

told him I’d write you 
how I subscribed for THe Crisis for 
my cousin and how he told me not 
many weeks ago how indebted he felt 
to me for introducing him to it. He 
said it is superbly edited and that he 
found it thrilling reading. I want you 
to know that I am always trying to 
serve the cause of the Negro. I am re- 
writing my play “Black Souls” into a 
novel. I hope it will “go.” I am so 
sick of the stage Negro with his limited 
mentality. I have written of two edu- 
cated Negro gentlemen but the pro-

I have been a reader of THE Crisis

always found it to be 
very interesting in 
every respect. I won- 
der why you have not a branch office 
somewhere in this state? When you 
consider the fact that our people are 
treated worse than dogs, you could do 
us much good. After the storm de- 
stroyed our town men and women 
were beaten, arrested and made to 
work without pay. Some were even

killed. I never saw so much hatred 
and injustice in all my life. We 
have a population of about 35,000 
and not a single man or woman is al- 
lowed to register and vote. Something 
should be done to better our condi- 
tions. All of us can’t leave and go 
North. Some of us have families and 
property that we can’t very well get 
rid of. Now what are we to do; stay 
here and be ill-treated; denied the 
right of suffrage; beaten and killed? 
I understand that a “Federal Patron- 
age Bill” as been signed by the Presi- 
dent, which I think is a direct blow 
to the Negro of the South. When the 
General Government begins to legis- 
late against us, then I think it is about 
time to give up. Oh! Where shall 
rest be found? Will the time ever 
come when we will be treated like men 
and women? Will the time ever come 
when we will be given our political 
rights? God grant that it will.

It would seem as if your movement 
to get for the African what he imagines 
he deserves is about as charitable as 
the white program of 
keeping for the white 
what he thinks God 
intended him to keep from the black. 
In short, you are like our socialists, 
capitalists and all other man-madeists 
in trying to be selfish and for special 
reasons the African cannot be made 
to become a self-centered bigot. He 
is so broadly created that when he gets 
into wealth and earthly power he blows 
to pieces and thus seldom can hope 
to perpetuate a dynasty of position 
or name or anything else. This is to 
say, the African has a celestial mind 
and is entirely unfitted for the earth 
and its delusions. As such I am writ- 
ing to invite your consideration to an 
entirely new policy and outlook. 

First, I marvel that the African or- 
ganizations do not monopolize Christ- 
ian leadership more. ‘They have the 
souls to grasp religion and to educate 
the white people. Why don’t they go 
the limit in their one great specialty? 
They live and thrive on works of char- 
ity which are the cardinal essense of 
Christianity. 

Again, the African is unfettered, 
generally, with modern education 
which in spite of your own very la- 
boriously earned degrees, I maintain 
are a ball and chain to the understand-

The South Revisited 
(Continued from page 43) 

The last place at which I stopped 
was Jackson, Mississippi. | While 
there, I called upon the wife of the 
president of the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored Peo- 
ple’s local branch. She apologized to 
me for not opening the door at once. 
She feared I was an agent, come to 
sell something—‘“and they are so per- 
sistent, you know,” she said. “I often 
have to buy some little thing even 
though I don’t want it.” I was in- 
terested to learn that white women 
worked assiduously for Negro patron- 
age. I had been sneered at for going 


among educated colored people. What 
60 


I needed was to make my work acqui- 
sitive, to make money out of Negroes. 
Then, and then only, would my visits 
be approved by Chambers of Com- 
merce and Rotary Clubs. My host- 
ess, who was young, slender and active, 
talked of many things — of the new 
high school for the colored, of the bet- 
ter streets where the well-to-do col- 
ored people lived. She liked her city 
very much. After a little, Henry, her 
boy of twelve came in, fine-looking 
youngster. When he had gone out to 
play, we began discussing the subject 
of whether o- not it were best for him 
to grow up in the South. 


66 ISSISSIPPI is my state,” his 

mother said, “and I don’t 
want to leave it, but sometimes I get 
worrying. I can’t forget what hap- 
pened when Henry was a small boy, 
not more than six. We were out 
walking together and we passed a little 
white girl who was eating an ice cream 
cone. My boy stopped and stared af- 
ter her, his mouth watering. A white 
man, loafing on the sidewalk, turned 
and said tome: ‘You'd better look af- 
ter that boy of yours. He needs a 
noose around his neck.’ ” 


I gave an exclamation of horror. 

She went on very quietly. “It was 
a good while ago, but I can’t forget. 
I wake up in the night, sometimes, 
trembling. It isn’t as if I didn’t know 
how little it takes to arouse the whites. 
I had an uncle who was lynched. He 
was a good man, a preacher and re- 
spected. But he got into words about 
a debt that a white man was trying 
to collect from him. He didn’t be- 
lieve the debt was just and he an- 
swered back and said just what he 
thought. 
That wasn’t so very long ago. So you 
can see sometimes I’m worried. I 
don’t bring my boy up to hate the 
whites. I don’t want to preach hatred 
to anyone, but I bring him up to avoid 
them.” 

The husband had come in and gave 
his opinion. 

“T’ve wanted to go North and set- 
tle in Detroit,” he declared, “since I 
read a catalogue of Michigan Univer- 
sity two summers ago. I’d like my 
boy to go to college there.” 


Will this Negro family, one of the 


most progressive and interesting that 
Mississippi is likely to produce, go 
North, or will it stay in the South? 
One can answer this by a coynter 
question: Will the spirit of the In- 
terracial Commission triumph, or that 
of the Ku"Klux Klan? I make no at- 
tempt at an answer, but I would add 
a third question: Will the youth of 
today, who are breaking down many 
conventions, break down the wall of 
caste? I remember a young girl in 





They shot him to death.’

Montgomery, when I was there twen- 
ty-one years ago. When she was fif- 
teen, her mother had put Dixon’s 
“The Leopard’s Spots” into her hands, 
saying, “Read this as you would read 
your Bible.” The girl arose from her 
reading with a deadly fear of a strange 
black man, a fear capable of creating 
a lynching if a Negro so much as 
brushed her sleeve. It is harder now 
to dictate the reading of a girl of six- 
teen; and even if the reading is ac- 
cepted, a mother is far from certain 
that her daughter’s interpretation will 
be her own. I often heard, in my 
travels, of a white college girl, with 
wonderful red hair, who had at an in- 
terracial meeting told of her happiness 


‘in meeting and learning to know a col- 


ored college girl. I like to think of 
her in contrast to the Montgomery 
reader of “The Leopard’s Spots”. If 
the young white men and women of 
education in the South learn to work 
with the educated Negro youth, they 
will outrival the progress of the last 
twenty-one years.

pool their strength in the deep blue

T is interesting to know that after 

the Civil War certain intransigeant 

white Southerners went from emanci- 
pated America to settle in Brazil. 

“In the first decade after the close 
of the Civil War parties of such 
unsubmitting Rebels could have been 
seen in Parana near Curityba, 
in the Campinas district of Sao 
Paulo, on the Rio das Velhas in Mi- 
nas, on the lower Rio Doce, in Bahia, 
Pernambuco and even in Para and 
about Santarem on the Amazon. They 
made small mark upon Brazil, but 
Brazil certainly put her stamp upon 
them and their descendants. They 
had gone to the wrong elect... 

The second book in Mr. Nash’s vol- 
ume gives the essential facts of geogra- 
phy; the homes; the land and water- 
ways; the fields; the heads and flocks; 
the minerals. It is the kind of informa- 
tion which settlers, business men and 
capitalists will welcome. In the third 
book the author takes up social condi- 
tions; education; health; free trade; 
co-operation and the like. The fourth 
book is a look ahead into questions like 
the possible conquest of the Amazon; 
the future increase of population, etc. 

Mr. Nash congratulates Brazil on 
her immigration policy. She has 
“wisely kept the door opened to Asia- 
tics, the best agriculturists in the 
world”. Free lands and _ schools

Why do you lift your gold little heads 
from the ground, 

Peeping about this timid way? 

Why are you blue and why again gold? 

Here is the story, 

Many times told: 

Your dark shade would show that 

Our Lord went away. 

The gold glow reminds us 

He came back one day.

That already know how to sing, 
There’re so many songsters all ready

I’m certain they practice all spring. 


In fact, I believe I have seen them at 
practice 

Or something that looked much that 
way, 

Head back and breast forward, 

They always sang skyward, 

Not minding if skies were dull grey.

@ James A. Parsons, Jr., Research 
Engineer for the Duriron Company, 
Dayton, Ohio, recently lectured to the 
Senior Class of Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute, Troy, New York, of which 
he is a graduate. 

@ Kweku Awuna Bankole, of Gold 
Coast, West Africa, was educated in 
England and at the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, Pittsburgh, Pennsyl- 
vania. At present he is studying the 
Soviet system in Russia. 

@ Dr. William E. Williams, Pastor 
of Hope Presbyterian Church, Chi- 
cago, Illinois, is dead. Mr. Wil- 
liams was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsyl- 
vania, and was graduated with the A. 
M. degree from Biddle University. He 
was the first colored Y. M. C. A. Sec- 
retary of the Y. M. C. A. at Baltimore, 
Maryland, and held pastorates in Bal- 
timore, Macon, Georgia, and York, 
Pennsylvania, before going to Chicago. 
@ The New York Recording Labora- 
tories of Port Washington, Wisconsin, 
whose Paramount Records of Negro 
music have been advertised for several 
years in THe Crisis, are adding to 
their already excellent list several new 
records of “labor songs” and “work-a- 
day songs”. The company is able to pro- 
duce these new records as a result of 
the work of Dr. James Edward Halli- 
gan, author, of Baton Rouge, La., and 
Professor W. Lawrence James, of the 
music department of Leland College, at 
Baker, La., who have devoted much 
time to collecting and studying this type 
of Negro folk song.

SOUTH AFRICA 


@ A native by the name of Lazaras

South Africa. 

@ The joint European and native con- 
ference held recently at Cape Town 
discussed the land question, which is 
becoming one of the most serious issues 
in South Africa, and whether or not 
segregation as practiced is contributing 
toward the development of South Afri- 
can civilization. 

@ Mankulamana, who on behalf of 
the Zulu nation welcomed the Prince 
of Wales on his recent visit to Africa, 
is dead. He led a group of natives in 
the battle of Isandlwana in 1872 when 
a British force was practically an- 
nihilated. 

@ The General Council of the Inter- 
national Federation of Trade Unions 
recently accepted the application of the 
International Colored Workers’ Union 
of South Africa. 


Rose McClendon 


(Continued from page 55) 

“For instance, the episode of the 
dowager quadroon, Octavie, a creature 
of amazing poise and innate aristocracy, 
motionless on the high stairs of the last 
act. Rose McClendon is so excellent 
at it.” 

John Anderson in the New York 
Evening Post speaks of an actress: 

“Who created out of a few wisps of 
material an unforgettable picture of 2 
proudly withered madam in the house 
ot the quadroon women. Hers was 2 
faded, but imperious beauty, the gaunt- 
ly tragical grandeur of stately ruins. 


She caught a whole day and time in 


the swish of wide black lace along a 
moonlit patio, and the lurking hurt in 
eyes that had Seen too much. Her name 
is Rose McClendon.” 

And finally this, from Allison Smith 
in The World: 

“Whether you think of ‘Deep River’ 
in terms of drama or music, the fact 
remains that one of its proudest mo- 
ments is utterly inarticulate. You can’t 
listen to lobby conversations in the Im- 
perial very long without overhearing 
rhapsodies on that brief but unforget- 
table scene where a little old mulatto 
woman in black taffeta and diamonds 
emerges from the French windows of

the shining and sinister New Orleans 
mansion and walks slowly down its 
winding stairs. On the first night the 
sudden hush that fell on the audience 
at this entrance marked one of those 
unexpected, involuntary tributes, as 
rare as they are significant. It is a 
tribute repeated with each of the per- 
formances that followed and it has led 
to a deluge of letters to the Hopkins 
office demanding the life history of Rose 
McClendon. 

“These short and simple annals be- 
tray nothing that might explain the 
secret of the extraordinary distinction 
in her scene. Miss McClendon is a 
native New Yorker whose destiny was 
divided between music and drama until 
she definitely cast her lot with the lat- 


ter by graduating from the Sargent 
School.” 


HE Krigwa Players Little Negro 

Theater of New York is begin- 
ning a path of some distinction. Two 
of its players, who were never behind 
the footlights before playing in this Lit- 
tle Theater, have stepped on a larger 
stage: Richard Hughey is playing an 
important role in “In Abraham’s 
Bosom” at the Garrick Theater and 
Doralyne Spence is playing in “The 
Stigma” at the Mayfair Theater. 


The Far Horizon 
(Continued from page 57) 


the world of whatever race, color or 
creed are one; and that war, imperialism 
and the exploitation of native races are 
mainly caused by the greed of competing 
capitalist groups.” It seeks to prevent 
“these evils by the establishment of a 
world organization of free peoples, co- 
operating in the production and distribu- 
tion of the world’s goods”. Our imme- 
diate proposals must be in line with those 
principles and their soundness will be 
measured by the success with which they 
tend to bring about the ideal of an in- 
ternational Socialist Commonwealth. The 
object of a Socialist policy for the Em- 
pire, in short, is to create the political 
and economic machinery that will enable 
such a transformation to be brought 
about. 

The British Empire is at present or- 
ganized on two widely differing and con- 
flicting principles. So far as the Euro- 
pean races inhabiting the Empire are con- 
cerned, it is a federation of self-govern- 
ing nations bound together by ties of 
sympathy and mutual advantage. 

On the other hand, large parts of the 
Empire are inhabited mainly by people 
who are not of European descent. None 
of these countries is democratically gov- 
erned. Some of them are governed by 
resident European minorities. The rest 
are governed by agents responsible to 
Imperial Parliament. Even where, as in 
India, Ceylon, etc., some sections of ‘the 
Native populations have been given, or 
are encouraged to hope for, a share in 
controlling the destinies of the countries

to which they belong, the workers have 
no political rights and the knowledge that 
this is only an interim report and does 
not attempt to go in detail into all the 
intricate questions which will inevitably 
arise, as the result of a courageous at- 
tempt to apply Socialist principles to the

down general principles and given con- 
siderable attention to the administrative

ing of God. Thought is the path to 
emancipation and it starts from atti- 
tude and not from facts, history or 
sciences. If education of today were 
intended to glorify God and not to 
swell the conceit of a few doctors of 
would-be learning for the advantage 
of the landed aristocracy, it would fa- 
vor the African. But because it is in- 
verted in its purposes, it now makes 
his lot harder. The more he knows, 
the less he understands. . . . 


Your comment in the book, The 
New Negro, is to me a positive indi- 
cation that you are inspired by little 
less than angelic wisdom in matters of 
international diplomacy. Some of your 
remarks are perhaps ill-pointed even 
if well intended but basically I have 
never seen anywhere else such a clear 
explanation of why the world war 
pivoted on the African conquest. It 
is a perfect statement. It also shows 
that the spiritual significance of the 
Civil War is tied up in a deep plan of 
the Almighty to prove finally to this 
hard-shelled race of man.that “the last 
shall indeed be first”. I speak of most 
white people as unwittingly caught in 
the snarls of delusion brought about 
by the peculiarly superficial type of 
mind they possess as white people. . . . 

Thus in my letter you will note a 
strange point of view—rather odd and 
you may ‘suspect that there are germs 
of reason which have not been planted 
about in your publication hitherto. If 
so, you are welcome to use it directly 
or indirectly in any way that may pro- 


-mote the African as part of the human 


race but I warn you,the war cry is 
not “Africans Get Your Shaze” but 
“Humanity Give Christ More.” 

I look to the African as the salva- 
tion of the world because he is the 
only race left that possesses the ele- 
ments of sanity. Why not start your 
program of race emancipation with the 
wisdom of God, and to this end I can- 
not advise you better than to revise all 
your concepts by catalyzing your mind 
in Swedenborg.— Epwarp PRICE

ET us understand this agitation for 

farm relief. We Negroes who 
take our thinking from provincial New 
York and who in darkest Mississippi 
and environs are dumb and blind per- 
force to the great movements of the 
world are being led to think that the 
Western demand for the protection and 
financial relief of farmers is nonsense— 
the Bloc devil raised against the Great 
God Party. But wait: remember that 
the tillers of the soil have always been 
exploited ; always the dumb, driven cat- 
tle who filled the fat bellies of the 
rich merchants, kept the artisans from 
starvation and_ starved themselves. 
Well we the black peasants of sugar, 
rice, tobacco, corn and cotton know 
that. Why are we poor? Because the 
things we raise are filched from us for 
a song or a kick and sold at prices 
which enrich everybody but the farmer. 
When as in Germany and Austria 
great Agrarian parties have arisen to 
wresk a part of the loot from Com- 
merce and Industry, it has been the 
land monopolists and not the ragged 
peasants who have gained. But be- 
cause of the land policy of the United 
States in the West during the 19th 
Century a New Farmer has arisen: 
a farmer who owns his one hundred 
sixty acres, can read and write and 
think and who knows that in the past 
every human endéavor has received 
government aid except farming; to- 
ward farming we have the primitive 
psychology which is determined to ex- 
ploit to the limit the man who raises 
food and clothes for the sake of the 
man who eats and dresses. “No”, says 
the Western American farmer. ‘This 
profit which makes millionaires of 
manufacturers and bankers is hereafter 
going to be divided in some part with 
us who feed and shelter them. Stand 
by us, Labor, and don’t let them sub- 
tract our just share from your all too 
low wages.” 

The only rift in the lute is that the 
Southern Farmer cannot stand shoulder 
to shoulder with the West, for he is a 
land monopolist and slave driver whose 
history makes him the tool of Com- 
merce and Industry. 

But let the black peasants and labor- 
ers lift up their ears to the meaning of

Two Audiences 


- two audiences I have spoken re- 
cently on Race Relations: Phila- 
delphia and Denver. There were some 
five hundred people in a hotel ballroom 
in Philadelphia. They were decorous, 
well clad, sophisticated. As social 
workers, philanthropists and teachers 
these five hundred persons knew quite 
as much as I did of my subject. There 
was no word of information I could 
bring. Other speakers could tell them 
something new: Herbert Miller could 
tell what the professors were saying in 
the colleges about new social classes; 
Bruno Lasker had new information 
about immigrants: but I was there as 
a sign and symptom. I was there to let 
them sense what Negroes were think- 
ing; how far they are still dumb, sub- 
missive, restless, purchasable. All my 
facts were discounted before I opened 
my mouth. But my manner and tem- 
per, the degree of shrillness of my com- 
plaint were carefully noted. 

In Denver, in a vast church, twelve 
hundred people, as many white as 
black, perhaps more whites, were tense 
for information. Denver’s Negro prob- 
lem is a newly arisen hot thing. A Texas 
bull stuck suddenly over the schools 


is goring the city into separate racial 
systems. A colored man who bought 
a home in a district of clerks and small 
merchants has been driven out. The 
Ku Klux Klan has been swaggering. 
The city is uncomfortable. The hat 
and habits of the South are being 
jammed on the West. I could say 
much here and they listened tensely. 
They drank in the beauty of the Negro 
music which a choir sang. 


Boys and Girls 


N lands of the East and in Africa 

a problem arises because the boys 
get all the current education and the 
girls none. In the United States and 
among this generation of American 
Negroes, the girls are getting longer 
and better education than the boys. In 
the Southern Negro colleges the wo- 
men are outnumbering the men. It 
may be said truly that if either the 
mothers or fathers must be ignorant, 
better let it be the fathers so that the 
children may be well trained; but the 
difficulty is that there'll be few chil- 
dren if the college women cannot find 
true mates and if colored men cannot 
come up to the economic and cultural 
ideals of the new Negro women. The 
remedy is not less education for the 
girls but more for the boys. Do not 
so easily let the boy drop out and go 
to work. Do not reserve all the strings 
of discipline and guidance for the girls. 
Do not get the silly idea that girls 
must be coddled but that boys would 
best fend for themselves. 


April 


LWAYS the miracle of spring re- 

mains miraculous. We remem- 
ber past springs and yet the glory of 
leaf and bud and thrilling sun always 
bursts upon us with new surprising 
wonder. Two months ago it blushed 
in the South where our masses sing 
and sigh. Last month I saw it whisp- 
ering to the callas and gerania of Cali- 
fornia. This month it comes to New 
York. Last winter it came to Fiji. 
Always everywhere it comes, always 
and forever New. And so again, 1927 
terrible years after, the Crucified Christ 
bleeds once more upon the lilies to 
make them rosés and to shame a white

earth with the red blood of black and 


brown mankind. 


The Higher Friction 


ET us take courage from certain 

present aspects of the Negro prob- 
lem. Friction there has always been 
between black and white since 1619. 
Friction there will probably be still in 
2019. But the friction rises in the 
scale; it touches, decade by decade, 
higher levels—higher interesis, higher 
sensibilities, even while the lower fric- 
tion persists. To illustrate our mean- 
ing consider this table. 

1860—Physical freedom 

1870—Crime and poverty 

1880—Right to hold property 

1890—Reading and writing 

1900—V oting 

1910—Lynching 

1920—Homes 

There was freedom for some Ne- 

groes before 1860 but that year it be- 
came a problem for all. The crime 
and degradation incident to emancipa- 
tion was critical in 1870. By 1880 we 
had to answer the query if Negroes 
cculd own property. By 1890 the Ne- 
groes’ right to some education was won. 
By 1900 the Negro had been disfran- 
chised in fact but in law he was a legal 
voter. Before 1900, lynching was de- 
fensible and met with little opposition 
and until this decade there was al- 
most no wide-spread problem of Ne- 
groes living in desirable homes next to 
whites because black folk were too poor 
to buy such homes. Thus even in the 
record of discrimination we are press- 
ing on and up. The founding stones 
still waver, far from fast, but the 
trembling walls reach up to higher fric- 
tion. 


The Columbia State and Texas 
ONZALES is dead. He had his 


faults but he could reason. This 
ability is beyond the ‘present editors. 
They ape his style—but Gonzales is 
dead. Their latest essay is on the 
White Primary and their lucid argu- 
ment is that the N. A. A. C. P. by 
attacking the White Primary acknowl- 
edges that the Southern Negro can 
vote. But why pray does the patent 
fact need our humble acknowledge- 
ment? One has only to read the plain 
letter of the law of the United States 
and of South Carolina to know that 
anybody in South Carolina, twenty-one 
years of age and a citizen can vote, 
the difficulty is that only one in ten 
who can vote do vote. Why? What 
is it in this remarkable state that dis- 
franchises nine-tenths of its voters? 
This calls for explanation. Is it be- 


cause of the White Primary? We do 
70 


not say; but however much the Colum- 
bia State may writhe and lie the day 
is coming and it is hourly nearer when 
Somebody is going to explain to the 
voters of the United States why South 
Carolina voters deserve ten times as 
much power as voters in Ohio. Is it 
because of their art and literature, 
their education and culture? They 
can laugh it off and yell “nigger” and 
send a big blatant demagog to repre- 
sent them in the Senate but the ex- 
planation is due. The N. A. A. C, P. 
has won the first great victory of dis- 
franchisement and before we finish we 
have a feeling that somebody beside the 
N. A. A.C. P. is going to acknowledge 
that the Negro can and will vote and 
have his vote counted even in South 
Carolina and Texas. 


Across the Republics 
HAVE crossed three republics with- 


in a year—three vast imperial re- 
publics: two thousand miles in Rus- 
sia from the Neva to the Volga and 
the Volga to the Dnieper and the Dnie- 
per to the sea, leaving untold thousands 
of miles beyond. Five hundred miles 
through Germany and now three thou- 
sand five hundred miles from New 
York to Los Angeles. Everywhere I see 
a lonesome land, clustering with ant 
hills here and there in seldom ganglia 
for protection and companionship, for 
co-operation and market — huddled, 
crowded, fighting, snarling, hurrying, 
screaming things, until the huddle 
breaks breathless against great heights 
and spaces—silent rivers, silent moun- 
tains and silent stars. The huddling was 
least and the silence greatest and the 
hope tensest and most flaming in Rus- 
sia. The huddling was greatest in 
America—New York, Philadelphia, 
Pittsburgh, Chicago, Denver, Los An- 
geles—and the silence of the plain: 
the Rockies, the Alleghanies and 
Missouri ached in passionate protesi- 
ing contrast. While in Germany the 
earth yearned: Black Thuringia, the 
lonesome Lorelei, the Wartburg of my 
burning Youth. 

America lay washed in the blood of 
the Lamb—sheeted with white snow 
from Altoona to Ogden. Monuments 
gazed down upon me—William Penn 
the Smug; Chicago smudge; the bluffs 
of Council Bluffs; the infinite Rockies, 
naked bones of primeval earth; Cali- 
fornia flooded with rain and floating 
like a drowned rat with roses beneath 
the clouds. And then! golden gorgeous 
resurrection! 

One strives desperately and in vain 
to make a meaning of it all—to give it 
the majesty of a unity—to grasp it in 
a phrase: Russia, Germany, tne United 
States—Republics! But it eludes, baf- 





fles and frowns. It has no eager an 
swer. These lands of earth will not 
be expressed. 





Criteria of Negro Art 

T has long been a truism that Ameri- 

can Negroes are gifted in music, 
but it is not so widely recognized that 
the Negro as a race has always exhib- 
ited peculiar artistic ability. The 
great sphinx at Gizeh has the face of 
a Negro. The religion and art of 
black men has long been known in 
Ethiopia and Egypt. Further than 
this, in black Africa, in the great val- 
ley of the Congo and .on the West 
Coast, artisans and artists have labored 
for thousands of years to express beauty 
in form and song. 

The slave trade did much to dis- 


tort and kill this natural artistic tem- 


perament, but slowly it surged forward 
again. First, in the music which be- 
came the only Negro folk song, and 
then in the dance, and finally in our 
day it has come to more and more ar- 
ticulate expression through the spoken 
and written word. 

What now are the helps and cri- 
teria of these new beginnings? First 
of all, art must have freedom. It must 
not be hampered, on the one hand, by 
the preconceptions of the white audi- 
ence and its desire for silly and lewd 
entertainment. And on the other hand, 
it must not be shackled by the sensi- 
tiveness and natural recoil of black 
folk from the past and from their 
caricature at the hands of whites. 

The Negro artist must have free- 
dom to wander where he will, portray 
what he will, interpret whatever he 
may see according to the great canons 
of beauty which the world through 
long experience has laid down. 

Next to this, the artist must have 
support. The American Negro as a 
race and in accordance with his num- 

s does not read books, does not sup- 


t periodicals, does not buy pictures. “ 


cull this we must learn to do. Only 


in this way can we give’to the world _ 


a new Negro American art. 

Such an art being free and having 
adequate support has an astonishingly 
fertile field before it—tragedy such as 
the modern world has, seldom sur- 
passed, comedy of exquisite depth and 


‘appeal, new and unusual beauty in 


contrast, color and tone. The age of 
Pericles and the 15th Century had 
scarcely finer appeal to gifted souls.
