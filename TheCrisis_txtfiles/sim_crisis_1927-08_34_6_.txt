UNDERSTANDING, 
APPRECIATION 


and 
wi. CO-OPERATION 


Students of Negro Progress in America differ as to the line of 
endeavor in which we have made the greatest headway. Some say 
in education, culture, health, finance, religion, etc. We, in the busi- 
ness world, contend that Negroes have shown their highest develop- 
ment in sympathetic understanding and sincere appreciation of each 
other’s problems and accomplishments under great handicaps, and in a 
warm spirit of co-operation. 














The Southern Aid Society of Virginia, Inc., protects the lives and 
well-being of its policyholders. Claims paid to policyholders help to 
support physicians, nurses, merchants, druggists, landlords, etc. Funds 
of the company are deposited in banks and these funds are loaned to 
home buyers, business and professional, as well as other people. The 
Society employs an army of young women and men. These activities 
help to lift all classes of our people to a higher plane in the scale of civi- 
lization. This powerful Race Lever is known and appreciated every- 
where. Here is an example: 












Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc. 664 Church Street, 
527 N. Second Street, Norfolk, Virginia 
Richmond, Virginia. 











Gentlemen : 





A question was put to me some days ago, asking what I thought of the Southern Aid 
Society. Without hesitating, I answered: Aside from the sentimental reason, which of course 
could not be discounted, from a commercial standpoint its services are invaluable, for it serves 
to take care of the wage-earners in distress and helps to put them on their feet, and it gives 
employment to a large number of men and women. These I could learn from observation 
and actual contact. 























I hope you will write more insurance, give more service, and thereby give more employ- 
ment. 








Yours truly

1. AT A Wuite CoLieceE. THE 


UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS. 


HE state of Kansas maintains a 
University for its youth. The 
funds necessary for the upkeep 
of the University are supplied by taxa- 
tion. The 100,000 Negroes of Kan- 
sas are taxed along with everyone 
else. Of course you know Kansas. 
Kansas stands high in education, she 
is a pioneer in social reform and up- 
lift. Kansas is referred to by orators 
as “Free Kansas”, “Bleeding Kansas”, 
the cradle of “liberty” and the home of 
John Brown. There are no official 
“Jim Crow” laws in Kansas and one 
of her Senators is proud of his con- 
nection with the N. A. A. C. P. 

The seat of the University of Kan- 
sas is Lawrence. Lawrence was 
founded by free soilers from New 
England. Historic landmarks about 
the town mark the places where they 
fought and died for human freedom. 
The leading hotel is named after a 
pioneer of freedom, Eldridge. Ne- 
groes, of course, cannot stay there. 

The University sits on top of a beau- 
Kansas tax- 
payers have given millions to add to 
the natural beauty. The Campus 
Beautiful (see catalog) is the result. 
A new million dollar library, a mag- 
nificent administration building, a 
huge stadium, and a Union Building 
have recently been built. No state 
has more reason to be proud of the 
physical aspects of her University than 
Kansas. 

The head of the University is 
Chancellor Ernest Hiram Lindley, 
A.M., Ph.D., a psychologist of re- 
pute. He is a first class Christian 
gentleman in the best American sense 
of the word. He hails from Indiana 
and has been President of the Amer- 
ican Association of College Presidents. 
It is one of his boasts that he comes 
from abolitionist stock. 


The Unrest Among N cgto Students 


om 





The following statements have been 
sent to the Editor of THE Crisis by 
persons of whose honesty he has no 
doubt. Whether or not they give the 
whole story he does not know, but the 
Editor is willing to learn from those 
who do know. 





OME one hundred and fifty col- 

ored students attend Kansas Uni- 
versity every year. Their scholarship 
is of the average type. It is the official 
policy of Kansas University to ignore 
their presence as far as possible. When 
colored students become too obtrusive, 
they are put in their place quickly. It 
is natural that colored students should 
seek places on athletic teams. They 
are absolutely refused any place what- 
ever. Dr. F. C. Allen, head of ath- 
letics, said recently that no colored 
man will ever have a chance as long 
as he is there. Complaints to the 
Chancellor meet no consideration, as 
he avows his support of the present 
athletic regime. 

Physical education is under the con- 
trol of the athletic department. De- 
spite the fact that students are required 
to take a certain amount of physical 
education for graduation, colored stu- 
dents are excused on the flimsiest pre- 
text. Colored students, men and 
women, are absolutely refused permis- 
sion to use the state-owned swimming 
pool. Swimming is part of some 
“gym” classes. On those days when 
swimming is given, colored students 
are excused. 

The University sponsors a series of 
concerts every year which are given in 
the University auditorium. Fine art 
students are required to attend. Col- 
ored students, required to attend, are 
segregated in the balcony directly 
above the orchestra where they can 
neither see nor hear intelligently. 






There was a feeble protest over this 
insult, but the Chancellor was firm 
in his policy. 


HANCELLOR LINDLEY per- 

suaded the Kansas Legislature to 
build a new dormitory for women. It 
is of the most modern type. Colored 
girls cannot stay there. The Chan- 
cellor said that there were so many 
Southern students at the institution 
that to permit colored girls to stay 
there would be unwise. One gathers 
that citizens of Kansas owe the South 
something. Nor is there any attempt 
to look after the welfare of colored 
girls and apply the same rules to them 
as are applied to other girls. 

The Dean of the Engineering 
School regularly calls in all colored 
engineering students and advises them 
to get out of his school. He says there 
is no field for colored engineers. This 
in the face of the Harmon award to 
an lowa Negro for achievement in 
that field. The Medical School of 
Kansas is at Rosedale, but is a part 
of the University. Colored Students 
are permitted to attend the Medical 
School for only two years. Further 
instruction would entail use of the clin- 
ics and that would be social equality. 

As a matter of course, colored stu- 
dents are excluded from literary and 
dramatic societies, glee clubs and the 
like. In spite of the fact that two col- 
ored frats at Kansas own homes, they 
are barred from the Pan-Hellenic 
Council. Every show in Lawrence 
excludes Negroes, save one. There is 
a balcony in that one in which they 
may sit. Colored students cannot rent 
a single decent hall in Lawrence, in 
which to give a party, nor can they 
secure the school gymnasium as other 
students do. School parties, proms and 
dances are closed to colored students. 
The Chancellor was indignant when 
some colored seniors attended his re-

The only two fair organizations at 
Kansas University are the impotent 
Christian Associations and the “Dove,” 
an unofficial student paper. Noted 
men and women still prattle of Chris- 
tianity and fairness and ideals in the 
Assemblies at Kansas University. 
There is a religious week every year. 
Sherwood Eddy and Max Yergen have 
spoken there. Chancellor Lindley 
opens every meeting with the Lord’s 
Prayer. 

There is little hope that Kansas 
Negroes will attempt to enforce the 
provisions of their constitution which 
makes this discrimination a crime, in 
spite of one notable victory in the Cof- 
feyville School case. The spirit of 
Uncle Tom is strong ir Kansas. Not 
a colored Kansan will dare to enter 
a first class restaurant, )otel, theater 
or public place in the whole state. 
Kansans are cowards, made so by sepa- 
rate schools in every large city, by beg- 
ging, fawning churches, and peanut 
politicians. And Chancellor Lindley 
will. continue to insult and degrade 
every colored student at Kansas Uni-

social equality. LorEN MItter,

INCOLN UNIVERSITY, Mis- 

souri, was founded by colored 
Civil YVar veterans in 1866 and is 
supported by the State of Missouri. 
From 1895 to 1921 it was a center of 
political graft and did indifferent high 
school work. In 1921 the state voted 
to make it a first class college and in 
1925 Nathan B. Young was made 
president. 

Here are the facts leading up to 
the present crisis in Lincoln University 
of Missouri: Evidently when the 
present governor was a candidate for 
the office, he obligated himself to turn 
over this institution in a spoils way, 
to a group of politicians whose guid- 
ing genius is the present secretary of 
the board (Negro) who is ambitious 


-to get control of this institution. 


As soon as elected, the governor set 
about to fulfil his political pledges, 
and formed a bloc in a board of 
curators in the interest of a change in 
the presidency, as a first step toward 
political exploitation. As you know, 


this plan was defeated by the prompt 
protest of the people, by the assistance 
of State Superintendent of Schools and

Curator Malone who broke the bloc. 

However, the president (white) and 
the secretary (Negro) were so deter- 
mined to carry out their program that 
they failed to call any meetings (except 
one gesture at a call for the purpose of 
camouflage) which is contrary to law 
and to precedent. They then marooned 
three of the friends of the administra- 
tion by giving them no chance to func- 
tion. 

In the meantime a still hunt through- 
out the state wis made to find three 
men in their stead—one white man and 
two Negroes-—who would agree to vote 
against the present administration. 
Some they approached refused to be 
thus pledged. Eventually three such 
men were found, no one of whom knew 
the president or had ever visited the 
school—a medical doctor, a dentist, and 
a business man. 


HEN the plan was known, the 

people made an outcry and did 
what they could through the legislature 
then in session, through the press, using 
every agency to convince the governor, 
the president, and the secretary of the 
board that they desired no interference 
at Lincoln University. There was even 
a legislative investigation of the presi-

dent’s unethical activities in selling 
stock to the teachers, and for failing to 
call meetings of Curators as required 
by law. 

While they were mobilizing their 
forces for a final assault against the 
scheme, through ““A Committee of One 
Thousand” from the state at large, the 
curators quietly met in star chamber 
session in the governor’s office, (not in 
the board’s office at the university), giv- 
ing the chairman of the executive com- 
mittee and the state superintendent of 
schools, who were friendly to the ad- 
ministration, only a few hours’ notice, 
and elected former President Clement 
Richardson president. 

In addition to discharging the presi- 
dent, they have also discharged fifty 
per cent of the faculty, most of whom 
were rendering efficient service. 

It is reported that Clement Richard- 
son, after considering the matter some 
time, has decided not to accept the 
presidency. Thus ends the second phase 
of the battle of the Negroes of Mis- 
souri to reclaim their school from poli- 


tical control. Joun R. Caswe Lt.

They are citizens of this common- 
wealth and provision should be made 
for the training of leaders of their race, 
for no race can grow and develop with- 
out leaders. 

About a month ago President Young 
was dismissed by the present Board of 
Curators. President Young’s dismis- 
sal was a direct slap at the advance- 
ment of colored education in this state. 
The school has progressed more under 
his leadership in the last three vears 
than in the previous twenty years. He 
was dismissed without cause. Three of 
the members of the board had never 
even visited the school. Last week the 
board dismissed some twelve or four- 
teen of the emplovees of that institu- 
tion. Mr. I. C. Tull, who has been 
registrar and Business Manager of that 
institution, was discharged from the 
position and two men were employed 
in his place. If the Board of Curators 
of Lincoln University can discharge the 
President of the institution and some 
twelve or fourteen of the best teachers 
without cause, then I am of the opin- 
ion that the future of Lincoln Univer- 
sity is not very bright. Such actions 
will destroy all confidence in the school.

R the past two or three years there 

has been a determined effort upon 
the part of some persons to secure posi- 
tions in Lincoln University. I have 
no doubt that when President Richard- 
son was elected President of Lincoln 
University, he was elected upon the 
promise that he would choose some of 
these persons for positions. 

While I cannot resign as a member 
of the Board of Curators of Lincoln 
University on account of my being an 
ex officio member of the hoard, I take 
this means to say officially that no one 
need expect me to attend any meetings 
of the Board of Curators of that in- 
stitution during this biennial period. 
Furthermore, I intend to exert every 
honorable means possible to let the col- 
ored people in every hamlet of this state 
know that the board at Lincoln Uni- 
versity is simply using that institution 
as a political football.

known for its justness and fair play to 
individuals regardless of race, color or 
creed. At the meeting of the Board of 
Trustees during the commencement 
season of 1923, the following announce- 
ment was made: “Students who are 
not permitted to attend their state uni- 
versities in their home states will not 
be permitted to matriculate at Ohio 
University.” With a careful analysis 
of this statement one will readily see 
that it was made with the intention 
of excluding Negroes, especially those 
who chanced to be so unfortunate as 
to live in those non-democratit states 
where they are prohibited from pursu- 
ing higher education in their state uni- 
versity because of race affiliation. 
During the summer of 1923, stu- 
dents who were graduates of the 
Browns Creek District High Schoo] at 
Kimball, West Virginia, made applica- 
tion for admission to Ohio University. 
They were refused adgpission because 
they cannot matriculate at West Vir- 
ginia University. The principal of the 
Brown’s Creek District High School 
and three members of the faculty are 
graduates of the Ohio University with 
very creditable standings. The sum- 
mer that the students made application 
to the university, the principal chanced 
to be in summer school at Ohio Uni- 
versity. When informed of the refusal 


on the part of the university to his 
students, he went into the president for 
a conference, and asked him why his 
students should be refused admission. 
The president prefaced his whole argu- 
ment with this trite hypocritical state- 
ment: “I have absolutely no prejudice 
against the race.” When asked why 
this action against the race was taken 
under his administration he replied, 
“Most of Ohio University students 
come from Southern States. They come 
from the poorer families. The parents 
of these boys and girls object to their 
being. in. school with Negroes. _ The 
institution 
growth. We cater to the majority. 
Your group chances to be the minority, 
therefore, you suffer.” 


HE question was then asked, why 

not place an extra fee on all out 
ot state students, since the ruling as 
stated seems to be unjust since it effects 
only members of the Negro race. 
Others will be admitted whether they 
be residents of the United States, or 
whether they are citizens of the state 
of Ohio. The president replied, “To 
be frank with you, the ordinance was 
aimed directly at Negroes.” “In the 
State of Ohio we do not propose to 
educate a group of individuals who are 
not provided for in their home state.

‘We did not care to embarrass the in- 
dividual or the race by saying Negroes 
cannot matriculate, so we worded the 
ordinance, ‘Those individuals who 
cannot matriculate at their state uni- 
versity cannot enroll as students at 
Ohio University’.” 

Ohio University has graduated a 
number of Negro students. They are 
ali men and women of creditable stand- 
ing in their various fields. Each is 
contributing his bit to the social de- 
velopment in some way. Each has been 
a credit and has reflected honor on 
his Alma Mater. Naturally these men 
and women would’ like to see other 
Negro: boys and girls have the oppor- 
tunity to receive the heritage of culture 
and refinement which was imparted to 
them. Each would like to see his son 
or daughter go to the institution which 
was the choice of his mother or father. 
Yet unless there is some modification 
of the present ordinance this desire can 
never be a reality.

Hail and Farewell 
ROSALIE M. JONAS 


U who have won from agony 
Your most consummate, poignant 
Art. 
From torture of the wounded heart, 
The soul in torment to get free, 
Your transcendental harmony— 
You Minstrels of the South, a part 
At last of our great Northern mart, 
Do not become such slaves as we. 


For we have forged us chains of gold 
So heavier, so much more base 

That our dulled spirit may not rise 
And break it’s fetters, as of old 

Arose the genius of your race, 
Circling and singing to the skies. 


She Walks Alone 
RAYMOND A. CROMWELL 


WINDING line of caps and gowns 
Came marching down the campus 
street F 
In couples paired; all smiles; no frowns 
Upon these faces, youthful, sweet. 


But here comes one without a smile. 
She marches with her eyes cast down, 
As like some loathsome, dread exile— 
Her skin is black—she walks alone! 


No gracious benedictions hers. 

No laughing banter from her friends. 
Nay, only biting, silent slurs 

Born in white hearts but to offend. 


Her wisdom matters not, it seems. 
(Her agile brain surpassed their own), 
Not even mind or power redeems; 

Her skin is black—she walks alone! 


The winding line of caps and gowns 
Moves on across the cold, gray stone. 
In couples paired; all smiles; no frowns-- 
Save one black girl—she walks alone! 


Love 
DOROTHY KRUGER 


A YOUNG girl speaks: 
I thought of love as a placid pool 
All silver green and moving light, 
Where one could bathe and forever 
cool 
The pounding pulse of new delight; 
But love came like a crimson bird 
Alighting on my heart to rest 
And flew away with unspoken word, 
Baring in flight his crimson breast. 
The mother answers: 
Love rose for me from the hush of 
dreams

spent in a state of coma, in 

which we gaze dully at the pan- 
tomime of life, our eyes straying aim- 
lessly with the moving shadows with- 
out obtaining an acute impression of 
the fable. True it is that at times we 
feebly rouse ourselves to question the 
meaningless dumb-show. Unable to 
emerge broad-awake with the first ef- 
fort, however, we fall back into our 
twilight impressions, and dream away 
the play. We are conscious only of 
the pomp and color, the grandeur of 
pose, and the elaborateness of pro- 
duction. We are satisfied if they ren- 
der time bearable! 

But in those moments when we stir 
ourselves to wakefulness, the thought 
comes upon us that possibly we have 
been missing some vital hints of the 
action. In those moments it may ap- 
pear that colors and shapes and move- 
ments, the flitting impressions and im- 
ages of the scene, have unduly fas- 
cinated us. While we have been 
dreaming away the play, the artist has 
been awake and ever striving to reach 
us through the veil of pantomime.

and uncertainties was opening out for 
him, when he could glimpse the high

in the spirit is his inheritance. We 
talk much of practicality; but in the 
last analysis that is most practical for 
all of us which reconciles us to a los-

demands of us continual striving and 
growth; that is most sorely needed 
which enables us to fight valiantly

life steadily increasing the influence of 
that vision, every work of our life in 
which we see the impress of mind and 
spirit,—all these result in a living 
faith, which sustains us in the ageless

« 











HE National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People 
meets in its Eighteenth Annual 
Conference with a distinct feeling of 
triumph. 

For twenty-five years the white pri- 
mary system of the South has been the 
most successful method of disfranchis- 
ing Negroes. This yeat, for the first 
time, we have secured from the Su- 


~ preme Court of the United States, in 


the Texas case, a decision which is the 
beginning of the overthrow of the 
white primary; and not only this, but 
in its decision the Supreme Court in 
the most emphatic language rewrote 
and reafirmed the Fourtenth Amend- 
ment as the fundamental charter of the 
rights of Negroes in America. 

The champions of race segregation 
have been chased from pillar to post 
in city council, legislature and court by 
this Association during the last fifteen 
years; the pursuit was crowned with 
success by the Louisville decision of 
the Supreme Court in 1917; and that 
decision was, this last year, reafirmed 
and strengthened in the Louisiana case. 

The Association during the past year 
has clearly proven the insufficiency of 
state law to cope with lynching. We 
have shown that a state like South 
Carolina is unable to punish mob mur- 
der even when furnished with circum- 
stantial proof of individual guilt. At 
Aiken, South Carolina, the lynchers 
are known. Their unmolested free- 
dom is the final demand for national 
action against lynching. 

We have studied during the year the 
Negro public common.school in seven 
Southern States and shown to the na- 
tion the present demand for elementary 
-education for black America; a demand 
reinforced by the cultural movement 
in literature and art which this Asso- 
ciation largely inaugurated and first 
encouraged and which is still show- 
ing vigorous development and healthy

growth. The reform in Negro higher 
education, begun at Fisk and continued 
at Howard, has with our continued en- 
couragement spread to other institu- 
tions. 


E note with hopeful interest the 

beginnings of liberal sentiment 
in the backward South, manifested 
in a changed attitude in some of 
the more courageous newspapers; a 
growing open-mindedness among white 
students; a gesture, still all too feeble, 
toward correcting the outrageous dis- 
crimination against Negro schools; an 
increasingly sympathetic attitude on 
the part of the cultural elements of the 
South; and, finally, a more decent re- 
spect for the public opinion of the civ- 
ilized world. These sentiments do not 
dominate Southern opinion as yet, but 
their existence is encouraging to every 
lover of justice. The persistent cam- 
paign of the N. A. A. C. P. for social 
justice has played no small part in the 
rise and development of this new con- 
science in the South. 

This record of achievement is by no 
means complete, but it indicates the 
magnitude of our task and the encour- 
agement which crowns our efforts. 

It would, however, be a grave mis- 
take for this Association or for the 
Negro race in America to feel that 
our recent record of triumph is reason 
for relaxed effort or lessened anxiety. 
On the contrary, from this record of 
achievement, we have just learned true 
methods of aggression and defense and 
we have begun to fight in deadly earn- 
est. 

Let us be frank and open with our- 
selves. The American of Negro de- 
scent is still a slave in the United

conditions. Peonage, even in the midst 
of such a calamity as the Mississippi 
flood, has been carried out openly and 
publicly with armed guards and 
militia. The doors of trade unions 
still remain partially closed and the 
path of the professions is strewn with 
discouraging obstacles even to con- 
spicuous ability. 

The condition of the Negro children 
in the public schools, both North and 
South, is still deplorable and they are 
not being given an equal or decent 
chance for common school training. 
Adequate high school facilities are be- 
ing denied in a large part of the South- 
ern states and in many of the North- 
ern states. Negro colleges are starv- 
ing for funds. State institutions like 
Lincoln of Missouri are at the mercy 
of grafting politicians and the admis- 
sion of Negroes to Northern colleges, 
even to state universities supported by 
public taxation, is being restricted by 
race discrimination. 

Residential segregation, clearly 
against the spirit of American institu- 
tions, the law of the land and the de- 
cision of the courts, is still being car- 
ried out by the manipulation of real 
estate dealers and financial. interests. 
Unfair marriage laws to encourage 
bastardy and prostitution are proposed 
annually in those states where they 
have not yet been enacted. In the 
government departments at Washing- 
ton, Negro civil servants are still open- 
ly segregated with the approval of the 
administration. 

Above all, the “Jim-Crow” car rides

Dear Mr. Du Bois: 

Undoubtedly, after having perused 
the contents of this letter you will pon- 
der why I would bring 
such a personal com- 
plaint of supplication 
to you. But sir, if you could only 
visualize the depressed spirit and un- 
steady hand that writes this, | am sure 
1 would share your profound sym- 
pathy. 

Mr. Du Bois, having read of you 
and after you and knowing you to be 
a_ well educated and intelligent person, 
I did not falter to bring my cause to 
you. For it is through such persons 
as you that I have been so greatly in- 
spired ani hope to be helped and en- 
couraged. 

I am a girl of twenty-one, trying to 
find a way to educate a younger sister 
and two younger brothers, who, on ac- 
count of a very disagreeable home life, 
threaten to leave at any time. They 
are very intelligent and smart children 
both at home and at school ; but having 
a step-mother who is insanely jealous 
of their progress has simply got the best 
of them. And unless some change can 
be made, I fear their little minds will 
soon be made up to leave and go to 
some unknown place as they once have. 
And being only thirteen and seventeen 
and the girl fifteen you can just imagine 
how they would get along. They have 
to endure a miserable home life. And 
when they should be doing their school 
work they are doing home drudgery, or 
at night when they should be tranquilly 
sleeping they are nervously cowed in 
fear at her nightly quarrels and threats 
to do bodily harm to them and our

father. In fact, her nocturnal ramp- 
ages have become so prevalent that the 
least provocation at night, excites the 
children something pitifully. 

To give you a clear understanding 
of my case I shall try to make my 
details as explicit as possible. As | said 
before, I am a girl of twenty-one years. 
I have three older sisters and one young- 
er sister and two younger brothers. The 
younger sister is fifteen years old and in 
her third year of high school. The 
younger brothers, one thirteen is in his 
first year of high school and the boy 
seventeen years quit school one year ago 
during his third year in high school, be- 
cause of his discontented home life. My 
mother having died April 23, 1918, our 
father again married the following 
June of 1919. He married a woman 
who had four sons and although they 
were practically grown then, she put 
them before us and does until now. 
She has always been jealous of the little 
things we ate or even the common 
things we wore and because of her 
avariciousness for herself and sons has 
been trying to encourage our father into 
stopping them from school and also by 
giving them commonest of foods to eat. 
| might say here, that those are my rea- 
sons for quitting, but if I only had to 


_ do it all over I would stick, as I have 


tried to coerce them to do. 

As you might imagine, her four sons 
completed high school and one is now 
in college, through her encouragement 
and, I suppose, part of my father’s 
money. And as for us she does not 
care as to whether we have decent 
clothes, much less an education. She is 
a very illiterate and unscrupulous per-

son and governs our father as if he 
were an imbecile. And he seems to 
think all the more of her. 

Perhaps you will say, “Why do not 
the older sisters do something for the 
younger ones?” Well, they have been 
as nice to us and our father as they 
could possibly have been. They loaned 
him money on his promises that he 
would place us in a separate home, fur- 
nishing us with necessities and occasion- 
al luxuries. He refuted all his prom- 
ises, insulted them and asked them to 
leave the house. ‘They have become 
thoroughly disgusted and seldom come 
around for short visits. 

Mr. Du Bois, I am sure you will 
agree that it would be a pity if these 
poor children, so hungry for an educa- 
tion, so eager to be given the oppor- 
tunity to have an education, so deter- 
mined to prove themselves worthy of 
all that is honest and righteous, should 
be so deprived. And for the appeas- 
ment of a selfish step-mother be des- 
tined to do manual iaber while her 
sons are pharmacists and one a journal- 
ist. Who knows but there might be a 
Dumas, Booker T., Dunbar, Du Bois, 
James Weldon Johnson among the two. 
Or there might be the talent of a Nan- 
nie H. Burroughs in the girl. They 
have not the natural talent to be a 
Winifred Hunter nor Florence Mills, 
but yet I do so want them to prove to 
her and her friends that some day they 
will regret the cruel things they have 
said and done to them. Several years 
ags I had several of my high school 
teachers predict a brilliant career for 
me but on account of this very thing I 
quit school six years ago when I was

fifteen years and a few months old. 
Mr. Du Bois, I thought by writing 
you, I could get some information as to 
what I could do toward helping them 
to remain in school. I thought I might 
be able, through you, to reach some 
person or persons, who would lend me 
a sum of money that I might be able 
to furnish a home, or make a down 
payment on a home for us and I could 
pay them so much a month or every 
few months. Dr. Du Bois, I am not 
seeking gratuity. It is just that I 
might be able to find a person sympa- 
thetic enough in my cause to help me 
financially. I thought perhaps some- 
one who had money would be willing 
to lend me a small sum and as sure as 
I live I would work my hardest to see 
that they will be paid. And as a secur- 
ity I would take out a Liberty Life 
policy to the amount I received, with 
them beneficiary, in case I should die 
before they were fully paid. And the 
younger ones, I am sure, would always 
revere the one who proved so helpful 
tc them. And too, I would be willing 
to take an oath that the boys would 
happily shine shoes or peddle papers 
(providing they could find nothing bet- 
ter) and the girl would do dishes or 
mind someone’s babies after school 
hours, for a happy home and an edu- 


cation. You see I have a carefully 
mapped plan already. I figured I 
could get a place and have an elderly 
couple and two distant men cousins 
of ours live with us and in that way I 
could keep the payments on our place 
and with the money I made I could 
easily take care of myself and the chil- 
dren. And I figured if my older sis- 
ters saw and realized the earnest sacri- 
fice I made for the sake of their educa- 
tion they themselves could pay back the 
sum I might be able to get. 

Please Mr. Du Bois do not advise 
that it would be best to stick here, for 
this is no home for us (an arena of ball 
diamond would serve the purpose as 
well). You might say, “If they really 
want an education they will get it re- 
gardless.” Those words are so heart- 
breaking yet I have heard them innu- 
merable times. And I have experienced 
their leaving home before and no one 
knows what agony it is to have loved 
ones blundering around in the world 
and you unable to find them or even 
help after once they are found. You 
know children of today are so credu- 
lous. They are so apt to follow any- 
one’s advice. ‘They seem to lack the 
perseverance and will-power that was 
so dominant in the men of yesterday’s 
fame. But I do believe these children 


have the makings of smart men and 
a smart woman and have not been pre- 
destined to be doers of servile labor. 

I do hope that I have explained 
things thoroughly enough to you for 
you to have an insight to our case. 

And if there should be any hesitancy 
as to whether they are worth the sacri- 
fice I am willing to make, I will give 
you an idea of their character. The 
two boys are very good athletes, hold- 
ing several gold, silver and bronze 
medals, also a silver loving cup for their 
athletic feats. The girl is considered an 
elegant public speaker and is in great 
demand at school and at our church. 
She was also awarded a gold pin for 
her attendance at Sunday School hav- 
ing attended three years in succession, 
not missing a Sunday. 

Mr. Du Bois, unless it be absolutely 
necessary, I hope my name will not 
be divulged publicly as I am terribly 
ashamed of anyone knowing what a 
weakling my father is. And too, he 
holds several offices in the Church, 
which makes the family rather popular. 
Yet none of their friends would believe 
that our home life is as it is. 

Hoping that I shall hear from you 
as early as possible, I conclude. 

Yours sincerely, 
(Signed) ...

England to think that this is a good 
opportunity to invite the Liberian 
President to England. 


ENGLAND 


@ Dr. Harold Moody, a Jamaican by 
birth, served as president of the Jon- 
don Missionary Society’s Easter Con- 
ference, held recently at Eastbourne, 
England. 

@ The Colonial Conference hela re- 
cently in London, was an experiment 
in co-ordination of Colonial officials in 
the Crown Colonies. Each of the ter- 
ritories with which the Colonial Office 
has had to deal, has grown up inde- 
pendently, gradually building up its 
own system of administration and grap- 
pling with its own problems. The 
Conference unfortunately had, we be- 
lieve, not a single representative of the 
peoples of these Colonies.

THE FAR HORIZON 


x 
HOWARD 


President Mordecai Johnson in 
his inaugural address spoke of How- 
ard: 

With 2,404 students coming from 37 
states and 11 foreign countries, with a 
bi-racial faculty of 160 members, the 
white members of which constitute some 
of the most distinguished men engaged 
in educational work in the United States. 
The colored members represent the 
largest body of competent colored 
scholars engaged in an educational en- 
terprise anywhere to be found in the 
civilized world, with building and 
grounds valued at three millions of dol- 
lars; conducted by a bi-racial board of 
trustees composed of some of the ablest 
white citizens of the country, functioning 
without condescension and in harmony 
with graduates of Howard University 
and other educated Negroes. 

He further pointed out that the ex- 
istence of such an institution at the na- 
tional capital constitutes a monument to 
the heroic devotion of the founders of the 
University, to the far-sighted wisdom 
of the Federal Government and to the 
genius of the Negro people who since 
the days of slavery have travelled all the 
way from complete illiteracy in the 
masses to the present when they are 
capable of occupying places on a standard 
University faculty and not only of teach- 
ing there but making original and creat- 
ive contributions to the knowledge of the 
world. He pointed out that Howard 
University had made original and creat- 
ive contributions to the knowledge of the 
world in Botany, Zoology, Sociblogy and 
History. ‘ 

He indicated that there was now need 
in the country for some national educa- 
tional center to develop a series of stu- 
dies for the purpose of discovering for 
the Negro and for the country what the 
actual situation of the Negro is in gen-

eral, where he is going, what is in the 
way of him getting there and how he 
may get there with the good will of the 
rest of the community. 

He pointed out the special fitness of 
Howard University, to undertake such 
studies. Situated in Washington, a 
Southern city, but a Southern city con- 
stantly stimulated by the national will 
and faith of the whole American peo- 
ple, with a bi-racial faculty and a bi- 
racial Board of Trustees, near the best 
library facilities in the country, it is an 
institution which has the confidence of 
the colored people themselves and all of 
the thoughtful members of other races; 
it has within its registration one-fourth 
of all the Negro students now engaged 
in college and professional pursuits and 
has a group of 7,258 graduates, dis- 
tributed in every state where Negroes 
live and active in every form of their 
complex life. 


DR. EDWARD GOIN 


At the Oberlin commencement June 
21 candidates for the honorary degrees 
were presented by Prof. Robert Archi- 
bald Jelliffe of the English department, 
who studied in New Haven during the 
past year. In presenting Rev. Edward 
Franklin Goin, pastor of the Dixwell 
Avenue Congregational Church, New 
Haven, for the D.D. degree, which 
was in turn conferred by President 
King, Dr. Jelliffee said among other 
things: 

“Oberlin College is never so happy as 
when she is recognizing the public ser- 
vice of her alumni, especially when that 
service has been performed in behalf of 
those who have a natural claim upon her 
sympathy and affection. I have the honor 
of presenting to you today a man whose 
service to his race it would be difficult 
to measure. For a quarter of a century

he has given himself unsparingly and 
without a thought of self-seeking to the 
spiritual and intellectual welfare of the 
colored citizens of New Haven. In so 
doing he has aot only proved himself a 
genuine leader of his people and a pro- 
found student of their needs, but he has. 
attained a high place in the councils of 
his church and community. He is one 
of those rare and devoted spirits who re- 
mind us anew of the dignity of human 
nature and who, in spite of the misgiv- 
ings that so frequently beset us, help us 
to believe in the future of our civiliza- 
tion.” 

The discriminating placing of a col- 
lege’s honors, at least some of them in 
quarters where is great merit not sound- 
ed in the market place, makes strong ap- 
peal to many. The policy not only digni- 
fies the individuals and the millions such 
represent but deepens the prestige of the 
coaferring institution for sincerity and 
insight among all the people. The col- 
lege becomes more “theirs” because the 
heroes of their own making are recog- 
nized; the idea that those who carry all 
before them and are steeped in success 
also command the entrenchments of cul- 
ture and spirit is pushed back in abey- 
ance. Someone beside heaven should 
recognize modest worth and sing the 
song of earth’s vanquished and it is in- 
finitely pretty and bracing to see Oberlin, 
which is no longer a small college but 
a mighty force in the middle west, throw 
garlands at the feet of a self-effacing 
colored man in a New England city be- 
cause he has wrought well.

Authentic information regarding the 
Negro pioneers in dentistry has been very 
dificult to trace. As late as 1885, just 
before the original dental school for 
colored people graduated its first class, 
when the total number of dentists in the 
United States was about 15,000, there 
were probably not more than twenty-five 
licensed colored dentists in this country, 
and less than half of this number were 
graduates of dental schools. Some of 
these practitioners became members of 
the original faculties of the Negro dental 
schools of Howard University and Me- 
harry Medical College, the first for Ne- 
groes exclusively, which were organized 
ir 1884 and 1886, respectively. The to- 
tal number of graduates of each of the 
dental schools that have been devoted 
to the training of colored practitioners 
is shown in this summary:

at present, and, in recent years, have been 
distributed chiefly to northern cities with 
the shifting masses of Negro population. 
The colored physicians and dentists in 
Chicago, Cleveland, New York City, 
Philadelphia, and Washington, D. C., 
collectively now outnumber those in all 
of the southern states combined. Of the 
number of Negro dentists now in active 
practice, fully 1000 are graduates of the 
dental schools of Howard University and 
Meharry Medical College. 


Before 1890 there were no organiza- 
tions of colored dentists, and until 1895, 
Negro physicians, in imitation of the pre- 
vailing attitude of physicians toward den- 
tists generally, disregarded colored den- 
tists as factors in health service and as 
a rule excluded them. from professional 
association. But there was an important 
change of spirit in 1895, when colored

Before 1900, Negro dentists were lo- 
cated chiefly in the South, and there were 
only a few in each of several northern 
centres of population. Colored dentists 
have gradually increased in number from 
about 125 in 1900 to approximately 1,300

gro dental practitioners. Since 1908, the 
National Medical Association has issued 
a quarterly Journal containing a well- 
conducted Dental Section. 

The numbers of colored physicians, 
dentists, and nurses recently graduated 
annually have been not only inadequate 
for each type of service in general, but 
also insufficient to keep pace with the 
needs of the yearly increase in the Ne- 
gro population. The situation affecting 
dentistry in particular may be judged 
from the fact that the total annual at- 
tendance of Negroes at the dental schools 
in the United States during the past six 
years (1919-25) was only 628, 769, 754, 
712, 542, and 443, respectively. The 
graduates during this period numbered 
only 115, 88, 105, 291, 180, and 100, re- 
spectively, a total of 879, or an annual 
average of 146. 

Eighteen schools had no colored stu- 
dents; three had a few such students 
but no Negro graduates. Of the twen- 
ty-five dental schools having white and 
colored students, the largest numbers of 
Negroes were graduated during the past 


six years (1919-25) at these institutions:

AT INDIANAPOLIS 
OMETIMES we laugh at each 


other when in the preliminary an- 
nouncements it is said, each year, 
“This bids fair to be the greatest of 
our conferences!” And yet this nearly 
always comes true; not that every con- 
ference excells in all particulars but 
in some one or two features we con- 
tinually touch high water mark. In 
Indianapolis the Sunday mass meet- 
ing surpassed anything we have ever 
had. Cadille Tabernacle was full for 
the first time in its history and they 
say it seats ten thousand persons. Cer- 
tainly that vast sea of faces that sat 
and listened three hours to Clarence 
Darrow and James Weldon Johnson 
must have numbered not less than 
seven thousand. 

The music at Indianapolis under the 
direction of Mrs. Lucretia L. Mitchell 
was of unusual beauty, finish and ex- 
cellence; and if from a multitude of 
striking speeches we may mention 
three they would be William Pickens’ 
psycho - analysis of “Segregation”, 
Charles §. Johnson’s “Changing Eco- 
nomic Status of the Negro” and Zona 
Gale’s “Medals”. 

The newspapers of Indianapolis 
gave us generous publicity and the 
homes and hearts of colored folk were 
wide and cordial. Only the white 
Christian churches, with a single ex- 


ception, refused absolutely to hear our 


message. 


LYNCHINGS 


HE recent horrible lynchings in 

the United States, even the al- 
most incredible burning of human be- 
ings alive, have raised not a ripple of 
interest, not a single protest from the 
United States Government, scarcely a 
word from the pulpit and not a syl- 
lable of horror or suggestion from the 
Defenders of the Republic, the 100% 
Americans, or the propagandists of 
the army and navy. And this in spite 
of the fact that the cause of the Louis- 
ville, Mississippi, bestiality was, ac- 
cording to the Memphis Commercial- 
A ppeal, “widespread indignation at the 
refusal of the Negroes traveling in 
slow, second-handed Fords to give road 
to faster cars”. And yet hiding and 
concealing this barbarism by every 
resource of American silence, we are

BOLSHEVISM 


HE 4Herald-Tribune of New 
York thinks that it is good poli- 
tics to find every now and then Bol- 
shevism rampant among American Ne- 
groes. Nonsense! If we were a few 
years further from slavery than we are 
the Republican campaign managers 
would not need to invent bogeys; and 
we suggest the following reasons: 
First, the burning of people alive 
in oil down in Mississippi without a 
single word of protest from the Gen- 
tleman who is capering around the 
Black Hills. Secondly, the fact that 
the University Travel Association of 
285 Madison Avenue, New York, 
which is taking shiploads of students to 
study the modern world, writes to a 
young colored man of Kansas: “We 
are sorry but colored students are not 
eligible”. While, on the other hand, 
the Student Council of New York, 
working in connection with the Rus- 
sian Student Bureau, not only invites 
but urges Negro students to visit Rus- 
sia; and some have gone. 


STUPIDITY 


MERICANS are remarkably stu- 

pid. They have just completed 
in Indianapolis a separate high school 
for Negro students; the first that the 
city has ever had. And yet the Presi- 
dent of the National Education Asso- 
ciation at Seattle says that the Amer- 
ican school system is the “greatest 
kindergarten of Democracy ever con- 
ceived”! In the face of such contra- 
dictions we blunder ahead. We im- 
port millions of slaves and complain 
because there are Negroes in the 
United States. We mix black and 
white blood and shriek for racial pur- 
ity. We open the doors to foreign 
immigrants and inveigh against the 
foreign born. We establish public 
schools in this democracy and then 
force the Catholics into separate 
schools by deliberately misreading all 
Catholic history; force Italians into 
Parochial schools by giving them poor 
accommodations and worse teachers in 
the public schools; and finally force a 
whole system of separate public schools 





upon Negroes because they are socially 
too weak to resist. Finally, we work 
every device to keep Jews, Negroes 
and foreigners out of the most aristo- 
cratic of our colleges. Then, with 
long faces, we remark that Democracy 
is a failure. Americans are remark- 
ably stupid. 


PAN AFRICA 


HE Fourth Pan African Congress 

will meet in New York City 
August 21-24. The subject of the 
Conference will be Africa and an at- 
tempt will be made to study from

the condition of different groups of Ne- 
groes in Africa and groups of descen- 
dants of Africans the world over. Rep- 
resentatives are expected from South 
Africa, Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Li- 
beria, and other parts of West Africa; 
from Haiti, Jamaica and other West 
Indies Islands; and from all parts of 
the United States. The voting mem- 
bership fee is $5.00. The present 
headquarters are: Room 688, Bible 
House, Astor Place, New York City.

Secretary. 


HIGH SCHOOLS 

R. W. A. ROBINSON, Super- 
visor of Colored High Schools 
in the State of North Carolina and 
President of the National Association 
of Teachers in Colored Schools, has 
just made a most illuminating study 
of Negro state accredited four-year 
high schools in sixten Southern states 
for the year 1925-26. Mr. Robin- 
son finds that-a white population of 
27,348,016 in these sixteen states 
has a total of 5,140 state accredited 
four-year high schools, both public 
and private, while Negroes with 
12,442,950 have only 204 such schools, 
and of these 71 are private. Mr. Rob- 
inson concludes, and his conclusions are 
unusually important because he is an 

official of a Southern state: 

“The figures for white and colored 
are contrasted not only to show that 
injustice is done the Negro children but 
to emphasize the unsoundness of the 
general public policy with regard to 
Negro schools. In practically every 
Southern State the school officials are 
deploring the serious inadequacy of 


203 


facilities for white public education and 
the resulting effect upon the social 
structure of the South; yet in each of 
twelve of these States there are more 
State accredited 4 year high schools 
for white children than the combined 
number for Negro children in the en- 
tire 16. Indeed, in each of five states 
there are more than double the entire 
number for Negro children throughout 
the South. Combining this with the 
fact that one argument against estab- 
lishing high schools for Negro children 
is the lack of students for them, we con- 
clude rightfully that the elementary 
schools for the Southern Negro chil- 
dren are still more inadequate and still 
more poorly equipped as to teachers, 
etc., and are barely raising the general 
Negro population of the present school 
generation above the condition of illi- 
teracy. Such a public educational pol- 
icy is inevitably creating in the South a 
vast, defenseless, exploitable group; a 
social cesspool of ignorance, disease and 
crime, and social problems of all kinds. 
Such a group is a tremendous liability 
to the South socially and economically, 
raising the unfavorable statistics and 
lowering the per capita wealth, both be- 
cause they do not either produce or con- 
sume as much as they would if given 
more favorable opportunities for eff- 
cient training and further because such 
a group is a constant drain upon the 
funds of the State for corrective and 
punitive measures and the objects of 
public welfare and charity programs. 
“Tt is distressing to know that in one 
of these States no data on colored high 
schools are collected while in five States 
the data are not published along with 
the data from other schools so that it is 
extremely difficult to get official infor- 
mation on the actual conditions of 
Negro schools throughout the South.” 


Mob Tactics 


HERE has been developed in the 

United States a regular technique 
in matters of mob violence. Matters 
move somewhat as follows: 


A crime is committed. The police 
hasten to accuse a Negro. This, of 
course, is popular because the white 
public readily believes in Negro crime. 
A Negro is arrested. If he is promptly 
lynched the police are vindicated and 
the guilty white persons saved from 
fear of detection. If lynching is de- 
layed but threatened a mob usually at- 
tacks the Negro district. This gives 
a chance for looting and stealing. If 
any Negroes defend themselves, imme- 
diately the police, often assisted by the 
militia, promptly disarm all Negroes 
and charge a number with rioting. If 
any white people are arrested for riot- 
ing nearly all of them are discharged ; 


204 


but the Negroes are held and prose- 
cuted. This serves to intimidate the 
Negro population and keeps it from at- 
tempting any self-defense, however in- 
nocent the defenders may be, and in 
no matter how grave danger to life, 
limb and property. 

The result of all this is to mystify 
and mislead the public. By the time 
that the rioting is over, they are under 
the impression that the Negroes were 
partially responsible for starting the 
trouble and that they were armed and 
conspiring to kill innocent white peo- 
ple. Thus aggression against Negro 
Americans becomes an exciting form of 
sport for the lower order of white folk, 
in which they have practically nothing 
to lose and little to fear. 

The technique of this procedure is, 
of course, taken from the acts of Eng- 
land and other countries in dealing with 
their colonies. Whenever the natives 
are subdued or punished and compelled 
to bow to the will of white folk, the 
explanation is that the natives were 
the aggressors ; that the Colonial Power 
was acting in self-defense and that civ- 
ilization was in danger. 

The only solution to this kind of 
problem is not simply to permit but 
to encourage Negroes to keep and use 


arms in defense against._lynchers and 
mobs. 


Standard Life 


HE situation with regard to the 
Standard Life Insurance Com- 


pany is clear. This colored company 
had its assets impaired while under the 
administration of Heman Perry. The 
company went into the hands of white 
people of Georgia and then was sold 
to a white company of Arkansas. To- 
day the National Benefit Life Insur- 
ance Company conducted by colored 
men has bought it and is offering to re- 
insure persons who hold Standard Life 
policies. Every person who holds such 
a policy should immediately consent to 
such re-insurance. It is the only sal- 
vation for the Standard Life. The 
National Benefit Life Insurance Com- 
pany is a successful organization. It 
is not responsible for Perry’s mistakes. 
On the other hand, his mistakes will 
mean that at least for a time the pol- 
icies must be scaled down until the 
unimpaired reserve is built up. If every 
policy holder will help in this process 
most of them will in the long run 
be insured for the full amount of their 
policy, and the others will certainly get 
a larger amount than they would if 
the company remained in the hands of 
Southern white people. It is unfortu- 
nate that prominent and misguided col- 
ored people of Atlanta are seeking to 


impede the only possible procedure that 
can save the Standard Life. 


Scholarships 


OLORED agencies which are 

seeking to help Negro students 
through college are forgetting one 
fact and that is, that the cost of col- 
lege education in the United States 
has risen tremendously since the war. 
It has been estimated that the aver- 
age expenses of an undergraduate stu- 
dent at Columbia University are 
$1,350 a year. This includes $350 for 
tuition, $212 for a room, $396 for 
board, $40 for books, $50 for laun- 
dry, and $300 for clothes, travel and 
miscellaneous expenses. Even with 
the severest economy no student can 
get through one of the larger North- 
ern colleges at less than $1,000 a year. 
A scholarship today of $100 or $200 
is hardly a drop in the bucket. Any- 
thing less than a $500 scholarship does 
not begin to pay a student’s expenses. 
Again, it is idle to expect a student of 
average ability successfully to work 
his way through college and maintain 
good scholarship. The standards of 
scholarships are being raised. The 
time required to do the work cannot 
be lessened if the student is going to 
be successful. Something can be 
earned during the summer vacation, 
but Negro students in the North re- 
quire today a large number of scholar- 
ships of $500 to $750 a year to enable 
them to succeed. 


Advertising 


HE Crisis says comparatively 
little about its advertising. In 
truth Crisis advertising is not a species 
of charity—it pays. Of many letters 


proving this we select this unsolicited 
word: 


“I would appreciate also your pre- 
senting this word to your many read- 
ers and I would say for your gratifica- 
tion that the advertisement that we 
carry in THe Crisis is by far the best 
paying advertisement, the best ‘puller’ 
that we carry anywhere. ‘I congratu- 


.late you upon the splendid appearance 


of the larger and newer Crisis.” 


John J. Mullowney, President 
Meharry Medical College. 


Vacation Work 
Bete ia ‘students and people of 


intelligence who would like to 
earn a substantial sum of extra money 
during the summer vacation may 
write to the Editor of THe Crisis. 
They should include unimpeachable 
references to their honesty and ability.

The Unrest Among Negro 
Students 
(From page 190) Raleigh, N. C., a few 


months this question presented itself to 
me: Do those who are responsible for 
conditions at Shaw really mean busi- 
ness? I came to know personally a 
goodly number of the two hundred and 
sixty odd bright, vigorous, promising 
students; their ambitions and possibili- 
ties. I also came to know what was 
and what was not being done for them 
(and, may I add, what was being done 
wrongly). The question stood me in 
the face: Do those who are responsible 
for conditions at Shaw really mean 
business ? 

There is one of three answers to this 
question: the Trustee Board and the 
Home Mission Board (1) do not 
know the situation; (2) they know but 
cannot help themselves; (3) they do 
not care. Believing the latter two not 
to be the case, let me suggest to you 
some aspects of the situation obtaining 
as I now write to you. 

Shaw is not answering the deep cry 
of eager students who come to her for 
life and more life. There are, of 
course, some high points; but most of 
the surface is covered by the waters of 
downright ignorance, antiquity, sloth 
and stupidity. And let me say again 
that the best that can be said for you 
men is that you do not know this situ- 
ation. 

The following are the more obvious 
of the unnecessary but killing faults in

the present life of the school: 


person- 
nel; grounds and buildings; living con- 
dition for Negro teachers; religious in- 


structions; the Theological Depart- 


ment. 

With reference to personnel the men- 
tioning of four names, together with 
their positions, will suffice to show to 
you how deadly is the pestilence which 
is destroying the very life of Shaw: the 
President [white]; the Dean of the 
Theological Department [colored ] ; the 
Business Manager [white]; and the 
Dean of Women [ white]. 


HE virtues of the President are 
painfully few and mechanical. 

He has a Master’s degree from Har- 
vard; he has a Kappa key; he has a 
mellow voice; he knows the Bible and 
believes it from ‘“‘cover to cover’; he 
can cry. The vices of the President 
are numberless and fundamental. He 
is ignorant and out of sympathy with 
the mind, needs and feeling of youth; 
he is ignorant of what it means to be 
a college president, standing always in 
the center of the picture, making long 
meaningless speeches on religion while 
the realities of his preachment mean lit- 
tle or nothing to him. The President 
is a weakling; he is afraid of Southern 
whites, lest he lose his “gained” pres- 
tige; he is afraid of the Negro Baptists, 
lest he be criticised. Our President 
thus loses most of his time dodg- 
ing imagined arrows while the col- 
lege suffers so severely. He has no 
burning zeal for the future of the 
school, nor does he have the personality, 
the intelligence, the breadth of vision or 
the moral courage to execute what real- 
ly is within his province. The students 
do not respect him, because of his gen- 
eral ignorance coupled with his viola- 
tions of the laws of conduct about 
which he preaches. The Alumni seem 
to have but little regard for him. . . . 
The Dean of the Theological De- 
partment is likewise unsuited for the 
opportunity which his office affords. In 
the first place his strength has been 
practically used up. He is unable to 
execute a vigorous program. His train- 
ing also makes him unsuited for the 
work which he is undertaking. He is 
out of sympathy with a modern Theo- 
logical Department because he has not 
gone through such a department him- 
self. For the past forty years he has 
preached in rural churches, lived in an 
environment of ignorance without re- 
turning to refresh his mind with new 
methods. His idea of a Theological 
Department makes him unsuited for the 
position which he now holds. He 
thinks in terms of a Sunday School 
Class, a group of ignorant young and 
old men, gathered around one who ex- 
plains verse by verse of the Bible and 





“There are no royal roads to learn- 
ing but there are many roads.”

then sends them out “equipped” to 
“preach” to the people. . . 


HE Business Manager is the poor- 

est excuse for one holding such a 
responsible position that I know of. He 
is one of the most ignorant persons in 
the employment of the school, yet he is 
one of the busiest bodies on the cam- 
pus. He is more of a detective than 
anything else. His actual: business is 
that of seeing when the. students have 
things in their rooms which belong to 
somebody else; what members of the 
faculty violate laws of the college and 
“society”; general gossip and the like. 
In the meantime the buildings are fall- 
ing to pieces, the bath rooms in the 
men’s building are filthy, teachers have 
inadequate provisions for their comfort, 
the grounds continue unkempt, especial- 
ly away from the front. . . . 


Surely one ‘of the most important 
positions at Shaw is most inadequately 
filled: the position of the Dean of 
Women. The girls are all above the 
high school rank. They are also point- 
ing toward, what is to every one of 
them, a wonderful future. Cut off 
from their parents at such a critical 
period in their lives they need the com- 
panionship and guidance of cultured 
and sympathetic women.: The present 
Dean is hardly a high school graduate. 
Besides she is stupid. She is a very 
good woman, but that is not sufficient. 


UST a suggestion will suffice to show 
the embarrassing and humiliating 
conditions under which Negro members 
of the faculty work. The white teach- 
ers all live in a separate building, fac- 
ing the front of the campus. In addi- 
tion they have their own private dining 
room. On the other hand Negro mem- 
bers of the faculty live about the stu- 
dent buildings, and in rooms that are 
poorly furnished, having to clean their 
own rooms. They eat in the students’ 
dining room. It is clearly, gentlemen, 
the practice of Jim Crowism and segre- 
gation. The Negro teachers have, for 
the most part, had splendid contacts in 
Northern universities. They think 
something of themselves and they are 
not unaccustomed to the practice of 
equality of treatment. The students 
likewise feel the sting of this insult. 
They are college students now and can 
see through a situation. Even in 
Georgia and in Alabama and in Ten- 
nessee there are schools in which the 
ugly practice of Shaw is absent. Shaw 
is in North Carolina... . 


Do those who are responsible for 
conditions at Shaw mean business—the 
Trustee Board and the Home Mission 
Board? If you do you will investigate 
conditions at Shaw; begin to build a

Lewis K. McMitian. 
(Former instructor in Old Testament 
literature, dismissed from his posi- 
tion for writing the above letter to 
the Board of Trustees.) 


On Misgivings 

(From page 192) way as the clown 
says those “same whoreson devils do 
the gods great harm in their women; 
for in every ten that they make, the 
devils mar five”. For the sentimental 
parson has quite successfully palmed 
off a frothy emotionalism as the good 
old faith of our fathers; and your 
wooden-headed philosopher can see in 
faith only the blind alley in which 
sense and reason end. 

But the living faith is not a thing to 
be confused with emotion nor with 
philosophizing, neither with the par- 
son’s “rhapsody of words” nor with 
the philosopher’s bloodless abstractions. 
It is a calm and vital thing, the sub- 
stance of things unseen made a part 
of a man’s very marrow; it is a con- 
scious living in and by the spirit, when 
one feels he is a growing soul. Your 
puerile scoffer may justly rebel against 
a stagnant and impotent credulity, but 
let him not then imagine that he has 
demolished the temple of faith. He 
only can value the guerdon who has 
attempted the struggle. For in this 
struggle to become a soul alive, man 
comes into a certain harmony with 
himself, a quiet well-being, in which 
he feels that he is one with the law of 
his nature,—and this is faith—a con- 
dition of our being, a very life beyond 


life. 


XAMINE -vell that skepticism of 
yours which you believe honest. 
Do you not find satiety and indolence 

there, some pain that comes from a 
craving for food and not manna? Does 
not your naturalist show you the real 
basis for his viewpoint when he admits 
that “the body always ends in being 
a bore”? Is not the Preacher a little 
disappointed with life’s food, when he 
chants his vanitas vanitatum? Why 
not admit that we have not endured? 
The secret of the whole matter may 
well be that we have tarried in more 
than one wayside tavern, and taken 
our ease with Doll Tearsheet and a 
cup of sack. 

_ But, though flawed and waging an 
unequal battle with life and our own 
chaotic nature, we feel that the strug- 
gle availeth. We find minds growing 
and souls alive; in the labyrinth we 
come upon the secret ways of an awful 
power, “whose footsteps are not 
known”. Bowed down by the penal- 


ties of our own ignorance and wan- 





-dependent but 





tonness, surrounded by the whirl of 
changing circumstance, we feel within 
us an unchanging self, an enduring 
aspiration. Far below the terrestrial 
nature, we can ofttimes strike a well 
of living water, able to impart new 
strength for the conflict. Out of this 
nettle life, we pluck this flower faith, 
a faith which is the more quickening 
because it forms an organic part of 
life, because it is the eye which sees 
through our daily existence. 


N. A. A. C. P. 


(From page 193) openly and brazenly 
into the Northern states. This form 
of open and deliberate stealing by 


charging black travelers for accommo- 


dations which they do not receive must 
be attacked in the courts with the view 
of utterly abolishing the iniquitous and 
undemocratic “Jim-Crow” system. 


ESPITE then all that we have 

accomplished, our task for com- 
ing years is all too clear. We must 
continue to strive for a national law 
against lynching, for more intensive in- 
vestigation and prosecution of peon- 
age, for the better education of col- 
ored children and for the abolition of 
“Jim-Crow” cars in inter-state traffic. 
We must continue to attack disfranch- 
isement and segregation and constantly 
stand on guard against further en- 
croachments on our fundamental 
rights. And we must above all re- 
member that our most effective weapon 
is an independent and unpurchasable 
ballot, mortgaged to no man nor party 
and cast not for past favors but only 
for those individual candidates who 
vote and act for our interests and the 
general good. 


Girding ourselves for this battle at 
home we are not unmindful of our 
oppressed and segregated fellows 
abroad. We send greetings to the raped 
and oppressed people of Haiti and 
Central America; to the enslaved na- 
tives in the Union of South Africa; 
to the people of Kenya whose land and 
liberty have been taken away; to the 
people of West Africa still struggling 
for full political rights; and to the in- 
gravely threatened 
states of Abyssinia and Liberia. We 
hail the dawn of freedom in China and 
the hope of independence in India and 
Egypt. And we thank all nations who 
are helping the darker peoples to gain 
the recognition of equality for all races 
of the world. .

IN ATLANTA 
RECENT court case in Atlanta 


illustrates, on the one hand, the 
serious attacks upon ordinary civil 
rights for Negroes in the South, and, 
on the other hand, the possibility of 
self-defense even before Southern courts 
if cases are rightly handled. 

On the night of October 4, 1926, 
about seventy-five colored passengers 
were riding on a West Hunter-Ashby 
Street car. When the conductor got 
into a dispute with one of these pas- 
sengers concerning the issuance of a 
transfer, suddenly the car was stopped 
and the conductor yelled: 

“Every damned nigger get off!” 

There was a wild stampede through 
doors and windows. Five white men, 
including the conductor, the motorman, 
two off-duty street-car employees and 
one white passenger, used pieces of 
iron and other weapons to drive the 
colored people off and a half dozen 
policemen with blackjacks attacked any 


_ who dared to open their mouths. 


One colored man, however, Dr. C. 
A: Spence, a dentist, and his wife, a 
pharmacist, remained quietly in their 
seats. When the conductor observed 
this, he rushed up to Dr. Spence and 
cried: 

“Didn’t you hear me say for every 
damned nigger to get off this car?” 

Dr. Spence replied: “I have paid 
my fare and it is late. I have no other 
means of getting home and I am going 
to the end of the line.” 

“T’ll be damned if you are!’’, re- 
joined the conductor snatching Dr. 
Spence by the arm and raining blows 
upon his head with an iron lever. The 
victim was kicked out the door into 
the arms of two policemen who beat 
him with blackjacks, inflicting bloody 
wounds on his head. Mrs. Spence 
cried for mercy and entreated the of- 
ficers not to kill her husband. For this 
she was shoved about, cursed and both 
she and her husband pushed into a 
patrol car and rushed to the police 
station.

T the station, Mrs. Spence was 

discharged, but Dr. Spence was 
charged with disorderly conduct and re- 
leased only when he had furnished $500 
bond. 


So far the case follows the ordinary 
routine of such happenings in the 
South. Usually the victim is so glad 
to escape with his life that nothing fur- 
ther is done. But in this case, Dr. 
Spence secured two colored attorneys, 
A. T. Walden, President of the At- 
lanta branch of the N. A. A. C. P. 
and a former Captain in the A. E. F., 
and A. W. Ricks. They appeared for 
Dr. Spence in the Recorder’s Court. 


Here usually accused Negroes put 
up no defense, are brow-beaten and 
ridiculed and given such sentences as 
the Recorder sees fit. But the colored 
attorneys in this case demanded, first, 
that all the witnesses against Dr. 
Spence should be absent from the Court 
Room, except the one testifying; and 
that a court reporter should make a 
stenographic report of the record. The 
result was that the case appeared so 
evidently as an assault and conspiracy 
that the only reasonable disposition of 
it would have been to discharge the 
defendant and prefer charges against 
the white offenders. This, however, 
the Recorder refused to do, but passed 
the case over to the Superior Court. 
Immediately the prosecutor tried to 
build up a case for the Superior Court 
by arresting Robert J. Lewis, a colored 
man who had testified for Dr. Spence. 
The bonds for the two were fixed at 
$3,000, although this was subsequently 
reduced to $1,000. 

On April 22nd, 1927, nearly seven 
months after the occurrence, the case 
came up before a white judge and a 
white jury, and a verdict of “Not 
Guilty” was rendered. This verdjct, 
however, was only made possible be- 
cause Miss Gertrude Arnold, a colored 
woman, dared to stand up in court as 
1 witness for Dr. Spence and recite her 
story fearlessly and with convincing ac- 
curacy. She was unmoved under the 
most rigid cross-examination and the 
testimony of five white witnesses 
against the defendants was unavailing. 

The reader must remember that this 
deed of Miss Arnold’s was a dangerous 
thing in Atlanta. She deserves every 
credit. On the other hand, Attorney 
Walden is not only a shrewd lawyer 
but a careful one, and backed by the 
moral support of the National Asso- 


. ciation for the Advancement of Colored 


People his handling of the case gained 
not only the applause of colored people 
but even of many whites. Messrs. 
Walden and Ricks have now gone into 
court to secure damages from the street 
railway company for this atrocious as- 
sault.

The moral of this story is: that it 
pays to make a determined and intelli- 
gent fight in the courts, even in Geor- 
gia. But such a procedure calls for 
courage, brains and money. How 
many poor black laborers can com- 
mand a $1,000 bond, the services of a 
capable lawyer and the chance of losing 
their jobs, and then wait a year for 
justice ?

The number of colored graduates of the 
remaining dental schools, during the past 
six years, was only 26; and the total 
for all of the schools, exclusive of those 
of Howard, Meharry, and West Ten- 
nessee, was 169. General growth of 
sentiment for segregation has increased 
the tendency, in many dental schools, 
to restrict the attendance to white stu- 
dents, or to admit only the small num- 
ber of colored students that may be use- 
ful for the treatment of a few Negro 
patients in the infirmary. Some of the 
dental schools do not permit Negroes 
to enter their infirmaries; others segre- 
gate colored patients, but several admit 
them to the infirmaries without discrim- 
ination.
