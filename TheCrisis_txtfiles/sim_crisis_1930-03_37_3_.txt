POSTSCRIPT. By W. E. B. Du Bois 


E are beginning to feel that 

when Herbert WHoover says 
peace he means peace. It is so un- 
usual for presidents of the United 
States to mean what they say that 
the Crow is sure he will pardon its 
hesitation —By all means let Smedley 
Butler enforce prohibition. He slapped 
the faces of the Chinese; shot the 
Haitian legislature into disillusion, and 
swaggered around Philadelphia until 
he was kicked out. He is an ideal 
apostle of freedom.— Twenty-four per- 
sons in the United States have incomes 
of $5,000,000 or more a year, and 496 
incomes of a million or more. The 
power of these persons over the destiny 
of this land and of the world is far 
greater than any similar power that 
Julius Caesar had and probably ex- 


ceeds that of Napoleon Bonaparte; 
which shows that democracy still 


live.—In England, they are whistling 
to keep their courage up, but they 
know quite well that India is lost to 
the British Empire—We are still 
chuckling merrily over Tom Heflin 
and the Alabama election. To see this 
apostle of race purity outside the 
breastworks of the White Primary

fills us with keen enjoyment.—During 
the last 3,400 years, some one has 
tound that there have been 248 years 
of peace. This is more than we had 
thought. We were afraid that some 
little Punitive Expeditions have been 
forgotten.—The annual cost of the 
British fleet is $278,000,000, of the 
Japanese fleet, $131,000,000, of the 
French fleet, $99,000,000, and of the 
Italian fleet, $63,000,000; but the 
United States, champion of peace and 
democracy, spends $375,000,000 a 
year for battle boats.—A United States 
judge strongly suspects that Douglas 
Clyde Macintosh of the Yale Divinity 
School considers his allegiance to God 
greater than his obligation to fight for 
the United States. Therefore the 
Judge refused to let Mr. Macintosh 
become a citizen of this great country. 
Mr. Macintosh ought to rejoice.— 
Millions of Chinese are dying of star- 
vation, but the Red Cross has decided 
to do nothing about it. After all, they

are only Chinese.—After Calvin Cool-' 
idge’s great word ‘“‘Private ownership 
of property is a sovereign right,” all of 
the economic thinkers of the world, 
past and present, should hang their 
diminished heads.—Sigmund Freud, 
the great  psycho-analyst, greatly 
doubts the value of civilization. And 
looking the civilized countries care- 
fully over just now we can see that 
he has some grounds for his argu- 
ment.—Again we say that our own 
idea of a modest shrinking violet is 
Admiral Byrd. All white Southern- 
ers seem to be that way.—lIt is so 
pleasant to know that no panic fol- 
lowed the collapse of the stocks last 
fall. At the same time, there are a 
few million people in the United 
States just as hungry as though we 
had had a panic.—While as usual the 
rest of the world is arguing that mod- 
ern methods of production can not be 
applied to agriculture, and that Rus- 
sia’s attempt to socialize farming must 
fail, Russia is going right ahead and 
succeeding. Which is to say the least, 
impolite.—Spain is going to try mod- 
ern government again. Italy seems 
hopeless.

NE of the phases o. the race prob- 

lem which is of vital interest to 
the public, yet least written about, is 
the question of intermarriage and race 
mixture. Few popular writers have 
dared attempt the subject and few sci- 
entists have had sufficient material at 
their disposal to warrant venturing 
conclusions. 

At the present time, however, there 
are three unpublished studies on this 
subject which might prove interesting 
if reviewed in a cursory manner. One 
of them is an article entitled ‘““The So- 
cial Significance of the Intermixture 
of Races in the Colonial and National 
Period,’ by James H. Johnston, Jr.; 
another is entitled “Race Crosses,” by 
George T. Dixon, and both are care- 
ful analyses of the subject from the his- 
torical and literary standpoints, respec- 
tively. The first, a scholarly study 
which served as a thesis for the M. A. 
degree of the author at Chicago Uni- 
versity, is a careful compilation of 
data taken from innumerable old rec- 
ords and arranged into a most coher- 
ent and illuminative treatise. The 
latter is a thorough and comprehen- 
sive survey of more recent literature, 
covering the ground from approxi- 
mately the period between 1864 to 
1926. This work was also done un- 
der the supervision of the Department 
of Anthropology of Chicago Univer- 
sity. The third is the report of an 
original investigation made by myself 
under the auspices of the Bureau of 
International Research of Harvard 
University and Radcliffe College,* and 
has as its subject “The Sociological, 
Geneological and Physiological Aspects 
of Negro-White Crosses in the United 
States.” The emphasis here is placed 
on such data as was obtained from liv- 
ing subjects in 1927-8, in contrast 
to that of the other two papers which 
consist largely of evidence from docu- 
ments and other treatises. 

As it happens, these three articles 
form a chronological trio in that they 
cover, through their bibliographies 
(which, in the first two instances, are 
very extensive) what has been said and 
done in this field in the United States 
from colonial times to the present. Fur- 
thermore, it is significant that although 
these studies were prepared indepen- 
dently, there is a continuity of thought 
running through them which, to a 
slight extent, amounts to overlapping. 
They might be listed, therefore, in the 
following chronological order:

Race-Crossings in the United States 


By CAROLINE BOND DAY 


Here is an account of the results 
of three scientific studies of race 


intermixture in the United States 
done by graduate students at Har- 
vard and Chicago universities. 





1. ““The Social Significance 
of the Intermixture of 
Races in the Colonial 


and National Period”. 1630-1864 


2. weace Crosses” .. 55. 1864-1926 
3. “The Sociological, Gene- 
ological, and _ Physi- 


ological Significance of 
Negro-White Crosses in 
the United States..... 1926-1929 

In the first article of the series Mr. 
johnson has analyzed the immense 
mass of data gathered on his subject. 

Upon the question of the intermix- 
ture between Negroes and Indians, the 
significant points of interest to me are 
the facts, first, that during the Colonial 
Period the same attitude of mind was 
exercised toward the Indian as toward 
the Negro on the part of the white 
man, and second, that there was an 
extremely sympathtic attitude existing 
between Negroes and Indians. These 
points are illustrated by the following 
quotation from Mr. Johnston: “In the 
colonial period there was also much 
mixture of the Indian with the Negro, 
both the slave and free Negro. Sym- 
pathies existed between the two races. 
It is interesting to note that in the 
massacre of 1622, not a Negro was 
slain. Neither law nor social barriers 
forbade the intermixture of the Indian 
and the Negro, both shared the antip- 
athies of the white man, while as 
slaves their treatment differed in no es- 
sential degree. Conditions of their 
life, slave and free, often led to the 
union of these races, also the final ex- 
tinction of Indian Slavery was, in part, 
due to the absorption of the Indian 
Slave by the more numerous Negro.” 

Concerning Negro and Indian mar- 
riages, one of the interesting quotations 
which he gives from other sources is 
the following from E. A. Kendell in 
“Travels Through the Northern Part 
of the United States.” ‘There was 
much of Negro and Indian intermix- 
ture in New Jersey and Massachusetts. 
The fact that in Massachusetts the 
children of an Indian mother would 
be declared free is said to have served 
as a temptation to the Negro to take 
Indian wives.” 

Under the larger topic of intermix- 
ture between Negroes and Whites 
Mr. Johnston begins his treatment by 
citing specific laws against intermar- 






riage such as those made in Maryland 
in 1664, and in Virginia 1671. He 
stresses the significance of those laws. 
‘Then he traces the development of the 
present attitude of the South on this 
question as it grew through two cen- 
turies of a system of concubinage. 
Many interesting side-lights are 
thrown on this system by quotations 
from a successive series of letters, 
memoirs and records of the times. He 
also cites specific cases of individuals 
which are supported by ample docu- 
mentary evidence before advancing 
any of the generalizations which he 
makes. 

Perhaps however, one of the most 
pertinent conclusions reached concern- 
ing this long era of attempted repres- 
sion of human passion is not given by 
Mr. Johnston himself, but is one 
which he quotes from the Edinburgh 
Review of March 1827 and which 
reads as follows: 

“Contemporary testimony seems to 
support the belief that the long estab- 
lished laws prohibiting intermarriage 
between Negroes and whites tended 
to increase rather than to hinder the 
intermixture of races.” 

Mr. Dixon deals also with the same 
three groups of crossings as does Mr. 
Johnston, namely, Negroes and 
whites, Negroes and Indians, and In- 
dians and whites. However, he con- 
siders them purely from the standpoint 
of the physical anthropologist, where- 
as Mr. Johnston’s material is more 
that of the sociologist and the his- 
torian. 

Mr. Dixon says of his own paper: 
“It is largely a review of the literature 
upon the subject, with an attempt to 
present the evidence in a brief and 
concise form. Unfortunately very 
little constructive work has been done 
upon the subject. There are few 
records of extended measurements and 
genealogies, which would allow for 
compilation and comparison with the 
work of others. Most of the litera- 
ture contains merely hypotheses and 
opinions based upon casual observa- 
tions. How largely these opinions are 
colored by the personal views of the 
authors is impossible to state.” 

Nevertheless, he gives us a most 
careful analysis of the works of such 
writers as Boaz, Davenport, Reuter, 
Rowe, Castle and Herskovitz, and 
then as a result of his own study he 
advances the following summary and 
conclusions: 

“So little definite work has been 
done upon the subject and so few cases 
studied, in which genealogies have 


81 
Ge Anan 
Usa ALO Vv ory 10Wh 


been obtained, that we can draw few 
definite conclusions. In many cases 
results contradict each other. In some 
instances students have assumed that 
they were dealing with mixtures of 
pure-bloods, when in reality there had 
been previous intermixture, which fact 
has materially colored the results ob- 
tained. How far environmental and 
sociological factors have entered in to 
alter results is not yet known. We 
are not agreed on all the criteria of 
race, nor have we any satisfactory 
method of measuring intelligence. Not 
being able to definitely analyze the 
pure-blood race, we are still farther 
afield and encounter numerous other 
problems in our study of the hybrid 
groups.” 

However, the data presented seems 
to Mr. Dixon to substantiate the fol- 
lowing tentative conclusions: 

1. In general hybrids tend to be 
intermediate to the parents in general 
body form and all other characteristics 
which are not usually considered dis- 
tinctly racial. 

2. Inskin color the tendency is for 
the hybrid to more closely approach the 
darker parent. This is explained by 
the fact that he has inherited a posi- 
tive skin pigmentation on one side and 
a blank on the other. 

3. In regard to hair, the exceptions 
to any rule, which might be formu- 
lated, seem too numerous to make the 
statement interesting. 

4. Hybrids are as fertile as the par- 
ent races. If there is any difference, it 
seems to be in favor of the hybrid race. 

5. Variability within the group is 
very much higher than in the full- 
blood races. 

6. In general the hybrid is more 
intelligent than the more backward of 
the two full-blooded races. However, 
this fact seems accounted for by the 
difference in environmental conditions 
and social status and not as the result 
of inheritance. 

The third paper of the series furn- 
ishes just the material which Mr. 
Dixon at the time of writing his ar- 
ticle, felt was lacking. It represents 
a genealogical study of a limited num- 
ber of families of mixed blood. While 
it proposes to be a study of the mulatto 
family (to use the term loosely) it 
also involves, naturally, the records of 
many Indian-Negro and Indian-White 
unions, as well as the Negro-White 
crosses. 

We have records of 2,537 adults in- 
cluded in this series, representing 346 
families. This material was gathered 
by the questionnaire method, and rec- 
ords substantiating their evidence are 
on file at the Peabody Museum at 
Harvard University. 

Naturally the sociological topics of 
this paper coordinate with certain gen- 


82 





eral theories brought out in Mr. John- 
ston’s work. But a consideration 
of the physiological characteristics of 
the group, under such headings as 
“Personal Appearance”, and “Health”, 
brings us into the field of physical an- 
thropology as does Mr. Dixon’s article. 
A discussion of the latter type of scien- 
tific investigation involves, however, an 
explanation of terminology and scien- 
tific laws which the length of this ar- 
ticle does not permit. Furthermore, 
my findings from real life in this field 
are with one exception, so similar to 
Mr. Dixon’s conclusion that with ref- 
erence only to that exception, I shall 
pass on to the other more general sub- 
ject matter. 

He states as the second item of his 
conclusions, that there is a tendency 
for the hybrid to approach the skin 
color of the darker parent. While 
this may seem plausible theoretically, 
I have not observed it to be true. In 
primary crosses between white and 
blacks the skin color is usually inter- 
mediate. In second and third genera- 
tions crosses between the mulattoes 
studied here, there is much variability, 
but as many of the offspring resemble 
the fairer parents as the darker. In 
fact, we have observed a tendency on 
the part of mixed bloods in this coun- 
try to “breed white” as we say. 

Let us then look at some of the facts 
brought out by the testimonies of the 
questionnaires which are substantiated 
by the documentary evidence from the 
first article. 

First, the large admixture of Indian 
blood as reported by half of the Ne- 
groes questioned, seems most plausible 
in the light of the laws and customs 
mentioned above. 

Another interesting feature which 
our summaries disclose is the high per- 
centage of persons of mixed blood who 
have been absorbed into the white 
group with or without knowledge of 
this blood. About 20 per cent of these 
families in this group have one or more 
members who are “passing” as it is 
commonly called. This does not in- 
clude those who temporarily leave the 
family ranks for economic or other 
reasons of convenience, and eventually 
return. One of the greatest handi- 
caps in collecting this material was 
caused by the reluctance of the mem- 
bers of such families to place on record 
any information which might serve 
later as a means of identifying such 
relatives. 

Contrary to the popular idea, that 
one must be a quadroon or an octoroon 
te “pass,” some persons of little more 
than one-half white blood (particularly 
if there be a slight strain of Indian) 
are frequently mistaken for Europeans, 
and are often addressed as Spaniards 
or Italians. This is a point on which 





the American public seems to be most 
stupid. One reason no doubt is the 
fact that many Negroes themselves 
have been mistaken in their calcula. 
tions and when questioned have mis. 
represented themselves as having from 
an eighth to a fourth more white blood 
than they really possess. 

A large part of this misapprehension 
has been caused by a lack of knowl- 
edge of the laws of inheritance. The 
extreme variability sometimes seen in 
the third generation crossings of mulat- 
toes, may produce two brothers of very 
different types, one of whom might be 
easily considered an octoroon and the 
other a mulatto. These persons of the 
fairer type, then, when referred to by 
distant descendants, have, sometimes, 
been identified as quadroons or octo- 
roons until evidence from some other 
branch of the family, or friends of the 
family have counteracted this opinion. 
Hence, the almost incredible amount 
of “passing” done in this country is 
readily understood when we realize 
that if persons of approximately only 
one-half white blood can be mistaken 
for quadroons or octoroons, certainly 
the quadroons and octoroons have long 
ceased to be suspected of identification 
with this group at all. 

Mr. Johnston tells the ridiculous 
story of one Monsieur Dukey from 
New Orleans, who visited the city of 
Memphis in the year of 1838, and 
who, because of his charming person- 
ality was received by the best society, 
entertained elaborately, and made the 
recipient of many favors. He then re- 
turned home, laid aside his grand man- 
ner, and his French name, and re- 
sumed his real role of quadroon barber. 
Many such instances sufficiently far 
removed by time, might be quoted to 
skow the gullibility of the white man 
then as now, when he refuses to be- 
lieve that a person of culture, charm 
and physical attractions can have any 
appreciable amount of Negro blood. 

Again, our evidence that the volume 
of white blood inherited by this group 
is not all from the poorer class of 
whites or from white males, is aug- 
mented by Mr. Johnston’s records of 
settlements of money and grants of 
land shown on county records by 
prominent white citizens in the colonial 
and national periods. Out of our 
group of 346 families, 114 of them 
bore the names and had some personal 
reminiscence of their white progeni- 
tors. In 76 cases there were heir- 
looms, photographs, and in some cases 
other unmistakable proof of these re- 
lationships. There were twenty in- 
stances of white mothers, 11 of these, 
however, were foreign born.

HE task of progressive labor action 

is the organization of those work- 
ers who have been neglected by tradi- 
tional trade unionism; the rehabilita- 
tion of unionism in those industries 
where it has petered out or failed to es- 
tablish control because of lethargic and 
self-satisfied leadership which refuses 
to recognize the inadequacy of craft 
unionism in such highly integrated and 
mechanized industries as packing, steel, 
rubber and automobiles; the stimula- 
tion of an offensive against the open 
shop, company union, employee welfare 
capitalism of the trustified industries ; 
and weaning labor of subservience to 
the two major political parties in order 
to create independent working-class 
political action. None of these purposes 
can be accomplished without first cre- 
ating a greater degree of solidarity than 
now exists among the workers. 

The two great obstacles to labor soli- 
darity are the psychology of craft 
unionism and the psychology of race 
prejudice. White workers both or- 
ganized and unorganized have sought 
time and again to prohibit the em- 
ployment of Negro workers, or to limit 
it to menial occupations or to those 
jobs that offered little direct competi- 
tion. They have tried to reduce Negro 
labor to a class of non-competitors. 
The employers although not free from 
race antipathy themselves have not 
hesitated to exploit. it as a means of 
carrying out a policy of Divide and 
rule. Thus during the early period of 
capitalistic development in steel, pack- 
ing, coal and shipping, the employers 
used Negro labor only spasmodically, in 
case of a strike, or in a period of indus- 
trial expansion when the supply of for- 
eigh labor was insufficient to meet the 
emergency, or because foreign labor 
had learned the necessity of union- 
ization. Between 1880 and 1915 
southern Negro labor was something 
of an industrial reserve for many basic 
industries. This reserve was not 
chiefly agricultural as is often thought. 
Its background was agricultural but in 
the eighties Negroes began to move 
gradually from the rural sections to the 
cities of the South, thence to north- 
ern industrial centers as occasion war- 
ranted, 

In 1915 huge waves of this southern 
Negro labor poured in to northern in- 
dustries when large numbers of our 
Tecent immigrants returned to their

The Negro Worker: A Problem of 
Progressive Labor Action 


By ABRAM L. HARRIS 







This article, which is published 
simultaneously in ‘THE CRIsIs and 
the Labor Age, is a report to the 
Committee on Progressive Labor 
Action. Mr. Harris is an instruc- 
tor in Economics in Howard Uni- 
versity and is studying at present 
on a Rosenwald Fellowship at 
Columbia. Mr. Harris’ main con- 
clusions are as follows: 










1. Intelligent appraisal of con- 
crete situations where Negro and 
white workers are brought to- 
gether, to determine the best way 
to bring about efficient cooperation 
between them. 

2. Recognition of the right of 
Negro workers to union member- 
ship and to participation in labor, 
political, cooperative and educa- 
tional activities on the same terms 
as white workers. 

3. Vigorous efforts to organize 
Negroes as well as white workers 
in all trades and industries, espe- 
cially in the basic industries em- 
ploying large masses of semi- 
skilled and unskilled workers. 

4. Building a Labor Party 
which will connect the Negroes’ 
special racial demands with its 
broader economic and social re- 
forms. 

5. Special study of the prob- 
lems of Negro workers by local 
branches of the C. P. L. A., and 
the establishment wherever it 
seems advisable of special commit- 
tees or conferences including both 
Negro and white workers and la- 
bor sympathizers. 

6. Promotion of educational 
work among both white and Ne- 
gro workers to show how race 
prejudice is fatal to their economic 
interests and social welfare. 

7. Promotion of a_thorough- 
going and persistent workers’ edu- 
cation movement among . Negro 
workers. Such a movement would 
explain to them our modern in- 
dustrial system, and the history, 
aims, achievements and_ possibili- 
ties of organized labor. It would 
also seek to break down the in- 
fluence of opportunistic, middle- 
class leaders among the Negroes 
who are trying to build up a Ne- 
gro petty capitalism, and who 
teach Negro workers that their 
economic interest lies on the side 
of the employer rather than that 
of their fellow workers, and that 
their national interest is best pro- 
tected by the Republican Party. 




















































former homes to answer the call to 
arms. More of this labor drifted north 
when the United States entered the 
war in response to the demand created 
by industrial expansion. And after the 
war it continued to come because of the 
cessation of foreign immigration, and 
because employers, traditionally hostile 
to the employment of Negroes awoke 
to their value in breaking strikes or 
in defeating the purposes of unionism. 
And Negro workers undisciplined in 
collective bargaining, ignorant of trade 
union traditions, distrustful of white 
workers especially when organized, and 
led by opportunist leaders nurtured 
upon philanthropy and the doles of the 
rich, not only accepted struck jobs with 
impunity, but accepted the employer’s 
terms as to wages and working condi- 
tions, chief of which was non-member- 
ship in trade unions, as a long denied 
opportunity for the mitigation of eco- 
nomic thraldom. 

These changes of Negro labor from 
south to north, from domestic and 
small industrial employment to capital- 
istic industry occasioned much bitter- 
ness between Negro and white workers, 
as was exhibited in the Chicago and 
East St. Louis race riots. But one 
wonders why astute trade union lead- 
ers had not foreseen in the sporadic 
employment of Negro strike-breakers in 
the early industrial development, the 
uses to which they might be put at some 
later time. For example, the once mili- 
tant but now almost shattered United 
Mine Workers saw that their ability to 
control the northern coal fields was de- 
pendent upon the degree to which or- 
ganization was affected among both 
white and black miners in the south- 
ern fields. Although the union failed 
to accomplish its aim, it recognized the 
necessity of organizing both white and 
black miners inasmuch as Negro mine 
labor was not only employed in West 
Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky and Ten- 
nessee but had a long history dating 
back to the 80’s in the breaking of 
strikes in Illinois, Pennsylvania and 
Ohio. Had similar strategy been em- 
ployed by other unions, it is not at all 
unlikely that a least the seeds of work- 
ing-class solidarity would have been 
sown among Negro and white masses 
before the exodus to the north. 

The fact that Negro labor was 
chiefly unskilled meant that it had no 
place in a labor movement that was 


83 





based upon skilled craftsmanship, de- 
spite the fact that it could be used, 
thanks to the increasing mechanization 
of heavy industries, to defeat the pur- 
poses of unionism. This applies with 
almost equal force to the organization 
of the unskilled white workers. Such 
unions as the machinists, the boiler- 
makers, the blacksmiths, the molders, 
the plumbers, the sheet metal workers, 
and the tile workers were never too 
friendly to their less skilled brother, the 
white helper. As a matter of fact these 
unions for a long time opposed the ad- 
mission of the white helper and sought 
to confirm his status in order to pre- 
serve their monopoly of the job. Some 
of these unions that were most bitter 
to the white helper were likewise hos- 
tile to the Negro. They sought to fore- 
stall Negro competition by excluding 
Negro mechanics from the union. So 
clauses were written to that effect in 
the union’s constitution or ritual. And 
many unions like the carpenters, the 
bricklayers, the confectionery workers, 
and the hotel workers, that had no con- 
stitutional barriers against Negro 
membership and that felt keen compe- 
tition from the traditional employment 
of Negroes, were forced to organize 
them into segregated locals; or leave 
them out of the union as the leaders of 
the molders did in Nashville, Tennes- 
see, because the white molders objected 
to the organization of the Negro and 
because the Negroes were afraid of be- 
ing discharged once they had joined 
the union. 

Today there were not less than 26 
unions whose constitutions or rituals 
limit membership to white men. They 
are the Brotherhood of Railway Car- 
men, the Switchmen of North Amer- 
ica, the Brotherhood of Railway and 
Steamship Clerks and Freight Hand- 
lers, the Order of Sleeping Car Con- 
ductors, the Order of Railway Teleg- 
raphers, the National Organization of 
Masters, Mates and Pilots of North 
America, the Railway Mail Associa- 
tion, the Wire Weavers Protective As- 
sociation, the Commercial Telegra- 
phers, the Boilermakers, Iron Ship- 
builders and Helpers Union, the Inter- 
national Association of Machinists, the 
Brotherhood of Dining Car Conduc- 
tors, the Order of Railway Express- 
men, the American Federation of Ex- 
press Workers, the American Federa- 
tion of Railroad Workers, the Brother- 
hood of Railroad Station Employees 
and Clerks, the Train Dispatchers, the 
Railroad Yard Masters of America, the 
Neptune Association, the Brotherhood 
of Locomotive Engineers, the Brother- 
hood of Railway Conductors, the 
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen 
and Enginemen, and the Brotherhood 
of Railroad Trainmen. 

Ten of the above 
affliated with the 


84 


unions 
American 


are 


Fed- 


eration of Labor, which has ap- 
pealed to them to lower the bar- 
riers to Negro admission. Those unions 
that have responded were forced to do 
so because of increasing Negro com- 
petition. But their response has usu- 
ally taken the form of separate organ- 
ization characterized by one or all of 
the following discriminations: Negroes 
are to be organized into auxiliary lo- 
cals but only where their employment 
has become traditional; the auxiliary 
locals of Negro members are to be 
subordinate to the nearest white local; 
Negro members may not transfer to 
white locals; they are not eligible for 
office; they may not be promoted to 
skilled work; or they are represented 
in conventions or conferences only by 
white members. This is the kind of 
response that the Carmen, and the 
Blacksmiths made to the appeals of the 
Federation. 

The Boilermakers have not as 
yet decided how they will respond. 
But in deference to the sacrosanct 
doctrine of trade autonomy, the 
Federation officials accepted these half- 
measures as something of a victory, 
which firmly established the Federa- 
tion’s claim of organizing all workers 
regardless of race. At one time the 
Executive Council was decidedly op- 
posed to the affiliation of unions that 
openly debarred Negro workers. This 
attitude delayed the admission of the 
Machinists. And it has been said that 
it was also a factor in the Federation’s 
refusal to accept one of the railroad 
brotherhoods. But the Machinists 
were admitted and without relinquish- 
ing the right to debar Negroes of the 
craft. 

The Federation sought to circum- 
vent the racial discrimination of its 
affliated bodies by empowering the 
Executive Council to charter directly 
local and federal unions of Negro 
workers who are debarred from the 
union of their craft, or who are un- 
skilled and, therefore, unorganizable 
into craft unions. This moral gesture 
has not materially improved Negro or- 
ganization or increased Negro trade 
union affiliation. 

In the first place the responsibility 
for the members of a Negro local ob- 
taining the prevailing wage is liable to 
fall upon the very union that denies 
them admission; and the Federation 
which is the “international” of such 
Negro locals, as it has been claimed 
surely cannot force a local of a na- 
tional or international union to handle 
the wage grievances of one of its di- 
rectly chartered Negro locals. In the 
second place these locals of Negro 
workers usually become dues paying en- 
tities that are separated from the main 
currents of the trade union world. In 
the third place the leaders of the Fed- 
eration have been too well satisfied 


with meager results to vigorously push 
organization among Negroes. And in 
the fourth place when persons inside 
and outside of the Federation have 
called attention to the weakness of jts 
Negro organizational policy, it has 
merely passed resolutions, or congratu- 
lated itself that it could find no fault 
with its past methods and results. Yer 
of the hundreds of Negro locals and 
federal unions organized by the Fed- 
eration between 1917 and 1924, there 
are not more than 22 at present. 

Instead of merely passing resolu- 
tions expressing a desire to see more 
Negroes in the labor movement, as it 
did at its recent and previous conven- 
tions, the Federation should inquire 
into the reasons for its past ineffective- 
ness among the unorganized white and 
black workers. It should seek to es- 
tablish some definitive machinery for 
bringing about greater cooperation 
among Negroes and whites in the labor 
movement. A part of such machinery 
should certainly have been _incorpo- 
rated in its program of workers’ edu- 
cation long ago. A proposal of this 
kind emanated from one of the con- 
ventions of the National Association 
For the Advancement of Colored Peo- 
ple a few years back but failed to pro- 
voke any response from the A. F. of L. 
leaders. 

To effect a rapprochement _be- 
tween white and black labor is, of 
course, no simple task. But what the 
leadership of organized labor needs to 
be censured for is not its failure to ef- 
fect greater harmony but its refusal to 
make some attempt toward a realistic 
understanding of the problem and the 
issues involved. If progressives in their 
turn are to make headway in bringing 
Negro and white workers into closer 
alignment for economic and _ political 
action they must first understand the 
difficulties and prepare to remove them. 
This is what conventional trade union- 
ism has failed to do. 

The known Negro trade union 
membership was about 45,000 in 1926. 
If the membership of the independent 
Negro unions, chiefly paper unions, are 
included the total membership was 
about 56,000. According to the census 
for 1930 there were almost 1,300,000 
Negroes employed in transportation, 
extraction of minerals and manufac- 
turing. So Negro workers, including 
those above ten years of age, were about 
4.3 per cent organized. But only 20.8 
per cent of all American wage-earners, 
excluding agricultural workers, are 
trade union members. The Negro 1s 
only about a fifth as well organized as 
all workers. When skill is made 2 
prerequisite for trade union affiliation, 
less than 16.6 per cent of the 825,000 
Negroes employed in manufacturing 1n- 
dustries are available for affiliation, 
since 68 per cent of them were un-

skilled and 15.5 per cent semi-skilled. 
~ Moreover those industries where 
trade unionism is weakest having cap- 
itulated to the offensive of welfare cap- 
italism, or where craft unionism can 
make little headway because of integra- 
tion and specialization have the great- 
est number of Negro workers. For 
example, in iron and steel there were 
106,000 unskilled and 24,000 semi- 
skilled Negroes in 1920; in the food in- 
dustries, mainly packing, there were 
28,000 unskilled and 16,000  semi- 
skilled; in textiles, there were 18,000 
unskilled and 8,000 semi-skilled; in 
lumber and furniture, 107,000 un- 
skilled; and in tobacco 20,000 semi- 
skilled and 21,000 unskilled Negroes. 
A labor movement which avoids the un- 
pleasant job of going into these indus- 
tries because the workers have mani- 
fested no desire for organization or be- 
cause organization will take time and 
money, is both timid and reactionary, 
and will become the victim of its own 
inertia. It is the task of progressives 
to precipitate action among the work- 
ers in these industries. And effective 
action cannot ignore the position of 
Negro labor if for nc other reason than 
that organized white labor is fully 
protected only when Negro and white 
workers are equally organized. ‘That 
there are obstacles in the way of unity 
between white and black labor, pro- 
gressives need not deny, but they 
should deny that these obstacles are 
insuperable. 

This denial should not take the form 
of the radicals’ stock-in-trade general- 
ization about the solidarity of economic 
interest between white and black work- 
ers. It should be embodied in intelli- 
gent appraisals of situations where Ne- 
groes and whites are being brought or 
have been brought into industrial rela- 


tionship. In such situations it would 
develop upon progressives to show 
white and black workers ‘how race 


prejudice defeats their mutual welfare. 

In this connection special mention 
may be made of the situation in the 
South. It is the opinion of certain 
white workers there that “the two 
races should have separate, distinct 
labor organizations connected by cen- 
tral bodies composed of representatives 
of both races.” It has been remarked 
that this “is an advance over the short- 
sighted, opportunistic policy which is 
still in vogue in most white labor cir- 
cles,” namely, that of excluding negro 
workers from unions altogether or at 
any rate being indifferent to the needs 
of this group. 

It will have to be borne in mind that 
there are dangers connected with any- 
thing which may lead to the develop- 
ment of a bi-racial movement. White 
employers are not actuated by racial in- 
terests. They will not hesitate to use

white labor versus black, and vice- 
versa. Certainly in the long run white 
and black labor cannot rise “to the 


highest position in the economic order 
apart from each other.” Nevertheless, 
vague, fine-sounding idealistic phrases 
are not helpful in solving the problem. 
We emphasize that intelligent apprais- 
als of concrete situations where Ne- 
groes and whites are being brought into 
industrial relationship are essential. 
But this is not all. The sympathy 
of groups of Negro workers who can 
lead the masses of their fellows must 
be won. To do this progressives will 
have to begin from the bottom and 
build up. They must carry to the 
Negro workers some understanding of 
modern industrialism and the position

of the worker under it, remembering 
that the Negro is of recent industrial 
experience. Finally, progressives must 
realize that Negro economic and _po- 
litical leadership is opportunistic and 
petty bourgeois. On the political side 
it teaches the masses that their national 
interest is best protected by the Repub- 
lican party; and that in local political 
matters they should follow the policy 
of rewarding their friends and punish- 
ing their enemies. Being economically 
weak the Negro like all such classes has 
looked to legislation for the removal of 
the social and economic disadvantages 
from which he suffers. A labor party 
which would connect the Negro’s spe- 
cial racial demands with its broader 
economic and social reforms can in time 
wean large sections of the Negro work- 





ers from the major parties. On the 
economic side, the Negro masses have 
been taught that their welfare is best 
promoted by adopting a conciliatory at- 
titude to those who control industrial 
and economic opportunity, through 
subservience to the wealthy and 
through the establishment of a sort of 
self-sufficient Negro petty capitalism. 

Here the progressives must show 
the Negro masses that their problem 
like that of the white masses, is in- 
evitably that of work and wages. For 
even if the Negro leaders who look 
upon the creation of Negro financial 
and business enterprise as the economic 
salvation of the Negro masses, are suc- 
cessful in realizing their ideal, the in- 
stitutions that they hope to establish 
are to be run on the basis of economic 
individualism and private profit, de- 
spite the tendency of these leaders to 
confuse “racial co-operation in  busi- 
ness” with genuine consumers’ coopera- 
tion. The success of a Negro petty 
capitalism will merely give economic 
reality to our contemporary Negro 
bourgeoisie which is temperamentally 
detached from the realities of working 
life. But however successful 
Negro business enterprise may be, and 
whether it proceeds on a quasi-self-suf- 
ficient racial basis or takes its chances 
for survival in the general competitive 
arena, it must in the nature of things 
remain a diminutive force in modern 
industrialism, which is to say, that its 
much heralded power for mitigating 
the stress of Negro unemployment wil! 
be inconsequential. The great masses 
of Negro workers will continue to find 
their employment with those who now 
control finance and industry. And the 
few Negroes who will obtain work at 
the hands of the black capitalists of 
the tomorrow will not thereby cease to 
be wage-earners. Their problem will 
merely be shifted from the center of 
modern economic life where white cap- 
italists dominate to the margin where 
small Negro enterprisers eke out the 
wages of management. 


class 


Thus progressives carry to the 
Negro masses some realization of 
the causes of unemployment, low 
wages, and the’need for labor union- 
ism and co-operation, in general; 
and of the reasons that explain 
the special severity of industrial 


disadvantage upon them as a racial 
group, in particular. But none of these 
lessons will take root if they are pre- 
sented spasmodically and, above all, if 
white workers are unwilling to accept 
Negroes into working-class fellowship. 
As great as these difficulties may seem, 
a policy of letting well enough alone 
or procrastination will never overcome 
them. Progressives will therefcre do 
well to begin to grapple with them 
now.

THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 


% 


MOORFIELD STOREY-LOUIS 
MARSHALL MEMORIAL 
CAMPAIGN 


E have said that the work of 

the fallen leaders of the N. A. 
A. C. P. must and shall go on. That 
two such men as Moorfield Storey 
and Louis Marshall should have died 
in a single year, is a blow to the Asso- 
ciation, which is mitigated only by 
thinking of how much these men did 
to advance its aims. 

How indispensable Mr. Storey was 
to the Association is evidenced by the 
difficulty which is being experienced in 
designating a fit successor to him. Mr. 
Storey was not merely the President 
of the N. A. A. C. P. from the very 
beginning,—the first and only Presi- 
dent the Association has ever had— 
but he brought to this office and to 
the affairs of the Association an im- 
mense prestige. He came of the best 
and oldest New England stock. In 
Boston and in Massachusetts he was 
a leader in civic affairs. He was one 
of the governing officers of Harvard 
University. 

In national affairs too his voice had 
weight. He was a leader in the move- 
ment for civil service reform. And in 
the field of law, he was one of the 
outstanding figures of the country, one 
whose words were heard with respect 
in the United States Supreme Court. 
He held the highest office which the 
legal profession can confer in this 
country, the presidency of the Ameri- 
can Bar Association, besides being 
president of the Massachusetts Bar 
Association. 

So that in coming to the N. A. A. 
C. P. Moorfield Storey came to the 
work as one who could add prestige to 
it. When he entered upon this work 
there was no glory in being associated 
in it. It was then an unpopular cause. 
Mr. Storey actually lost friends when 
he accepted the office. He became 
president not for any lustre the office 
could shed upon the man, but to work. 
And work he did, tirelessly, courage- 
ously and above all, effectively. 

The very ground that American 
Negroes tread, the air they breathe, 
will be freer ground, freer air, by rea- 
son of the work Mr. Storey gave. It 
was he who filed the only brief sub- 
mitted by any private individual or 
organization in the celebrated Grand- 


86 














father Clause case by which this form 
of disfranchisement was outlawed in 
the U. S. Supreme Court in 1915. It 
was he who carried to the Supreme 
Court the question whether cities and 
states could establish vliettoes for Ne- 
groes in American cities. Winning 
the classic Louisville Segregation case, 
Buchanan v. Warley, in 1917, which 
has many times served as a basis for 
numerous other victories on this issue. 
If colored men and women can buy 
and live in decent homes, freely, 
wherever they wish in American cities, 
unhindered by any law or ordinance, 
they have Moorfield Storey to thank. 

A third great case Moorfield Storey 
won. When the oppressed Negro 
farmers of Arkansas, seeking relief 
from the peonage system used by their 
landlords to keep them in perpetual 
debt—when these farmers sought to 
organize and employ a lawyer, they 
were shot down and hunted like wild 
beasts. Twelve of them were con- 
demned to death and many others—67 
in all—were sentenced to long prison 
terms. The cases of six of the twelve, 
who were under death sentence, Mr. 
Storey carried before the U. S, Su- 
preme Court. And there, speaking for 
poor, friendless, helpless men, Mr. 
Storey not only brought about their 
release, and the consequent release of 
the other men; but he established a 
principle vital to all citizens having to 
stand trial in this country. That 
principle is that a trial dominated by 
a mob, is not due process of law. The 
Supreme Court so held. 

In rendering this decision, the U. 
S. Supreme Court reversed the posi- 
tion it had taken in the trial of Leo 
Frank. The celebrated attorney for 
Leo Frank was the first to appreciate 
the importance of this decision affirm- 
ing a principle for which he had con- 
tended in vain when he was defending 
Leo Frank. It was this decision in 
the case of the Arkansas farmers that 
first enlisted Louis Marshall’s interest 
in the N. A. A.C. P. He too brought 
to the Association an immense prestige. 
His fame as a constitutional lawyer 
was national. His briefs before the 
U. S. Supreme Court were models of 
clarity and learning. Internationally 
he was known as a leader in Jewish 
affairs. It happened that in the years 
when Moorfield Storey was ageing, 
and he could no longer so actively de- 
vote himself to the cases of the Asso- 
ciation, Mr. Marshall stepped into the 


me 


breach. Segregation cases, the famous 
Texas White Primary case, the Vir. 
ginia White Primary case recently won 
before the U. S. District Court of 
Appeals, innumerable other cases test. 
ing, affirming, safeguarding the basic 
citizenship rights of the Negro, passed 
before Mr. Marshall. He read the 
briefs prepared by other attorneys, 
Sometimes he rewrote them entirely, 
Not a detail escaped him. It is safe 
to say that in the past few years not 
a single case of any importance has 
been undertaken by the N. A. A. C. P. 
that was not either prepared by Mr. 
Marshall or else carefully supervised 
and directed by him. All this, as in 
the case of Mr. Storey, was a gift to 
the Association, and through the Asso- 
ciation, to colored citizens of the 
United States and their children. Both 
of these eminent leaders of the bar, 
besides contributing services which 
could never have been paid for, gave 
generously of their funds as well. 

Now both of them are gone. The 
records remain of what they accom- 
plished. But the N. A. A. C. P. has 
never rested on records. Its gaze has 
always been directed toward the fu- 
ture. It has been pointed out that 
new leaders are stepping in to carry 
on the work. And for the work of the 
future, the work of Moorfield Storey 
and Louis Marshall, that must go on, 
it has seemed that nothing could be 
more appropriate than a memorial 
drive. A campaign to inform people 
of the work these leaders did, to in- 
spire them with its tenacity and its 
effectiveness, and to make them fee! 
that it was worth while doing, worth 
while because of the spirit it en- 
gendered that will carry on. 

The Moorfield Storey-Louis Mar- 
shall Memorial Campaign has been de- 
cided upon for this Spring by the N. 
A. A.C. P. It will celebrate the im- 
mense forward strides made under the 
leadership of these men. It will be a 
call to all those who believe in the 
work to support it, and to help to 
realize the aims for which those two 
leaders were striving unselfishly. 

The Moorfield Storey-Louis Mar- 
shall Memorial Campaign is launched 
in the 21st year of the National Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People. The Annual Spring 
Conference, to be held this year in 
Springfield, Massachusetts, is the 2st 
such conference of the N. A. A. C. P.

HE National Conference on Col- 

ored Work of the Y. M. C. A. 
met in Chicago, Illinois, October 18, 
19 and 20. The following summary 
of the four years’ work was made: 

Some of the outstanding accomplish- 
ments of the Colored Work since the 
Washington Conference in 1925 are: 

1. An increasing number of colored 
men have entered the lay leadership of 
the National Movement: Dr. John P. 
Turner, member of National Physical 
Work Committee; William Stuart 
Nelson, member of National Religious 
Education Committee; William H. 
Wortham, member of National Per- 
sonnel Committee; Bishops W. T. 
Vernon, R. A. Carter and W. J. 
Walls, and Dr. John Hope, members 
of National Counselling Commission 
of Churches. 

2. Eighteen Negro delegates were 
sent to the Helsingfors Conference. 
Four Negroes were among the 48 
group leaders of the Conference. 

3. Dr. John Hope has been ap- 
pointed a member of the World’s Com- 
mittee. As such he has made two trips 
to Geneva to attend meetings of the 
Committee. 

4. Frank T. Wilson, National Stu- 
dent Secretary, and Max Yergan at- 
tended the World Student Christian 
Federation Convention in India last 
year, 

5. Dr. John Hope and Max Yer- 
gan attended the Jerusalem Conference 
last year. 

6. New associations have been 
opened at Chattanooga, Tenn., Greens- 
boro, N. C., Jamaica, N. Y.; Newark, 


March, 1930 


The Y. M. C. A. 


N. J.; Trenton, N. J.; Roanoke, Va.; 
Wilmington, Del.; Rochester, N. Y.; 
St. Joseph, Mo.; South Bend, Ind.; 
Toledo, Ohio; White Plains, N. Y.; 
Winston-Salem, N. C.; Summit, N. J. 

7. Building Campaigns have been 
conducted in Atlantic City, N. J.; 
Buffalo, N. Y.; Dallas, Texas; Day- 
ton, Ohio; Evanston, Ill.; German- 
town, Pa.; Los Angeles, Calif.; Mont- 
clair, N. J.; New Orleans, La.; New 
York, N. Y.; Toledo, Ohio; Winston- 
Salem, N. C.; Youngstown, Ohio. To 
all campaigns except two Mr. Julius 
Rosenwald contributed $25,000.00. 
The total amount represented in this 
expansion is $2,690,735.00. 

8. New Buildings. have been opened 
in Atlantic City, N. J.; Dayton, Ohio; 
Buffalo, N. Y.; Los Angeles, Calif. ; 
and Montclair, N. J. In the case of 
one building, the building in Los An- 
geles, the plans were drawn by a young 
colored man, Mr. Paul R. Williams. 
The work was so exceptional that the 
plans and photographs of the building 
were framed and placed on the walls of 
the Architectural Bureau in New 
York. Because of the efficiency of 
Mr. Williams’ work he was awarded 
the contract to prepare the plans for 
the Hollywood, Calif., building. Mr. 
Williams made preliminary drawings 
for Max Yergan’s building without 
charge as a contribution to the South 
African work. 

9. Max Yergan returned to the 
United States on furlough. While 
here he spent most of his time trav- 
elling throughout the country telling 
of his work in South Africa and his 





need for a building as a training cen- 
ter at Fort Hare, Cape Province. The 
total cost of this building will be about 
$45,000.00. On personal appeal, Mr. 
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., through his 
secretary, gave $25,000.00 towards this 
amount on the condition that the bal- 
ance be raised. 

10. A very satisfying advance has 
been made in the number and quality 
of Older Boys Conferences. Many 
States in the South and some in the 
North have held conferences. Charac- 
ter improvement with participation of 
boys in conferences, has been marked. 

11. Several problems of National 
and State services have arisen during 
the quadrennial: 

a. Particular concern has been felt 
as to our National organization, espe- 
cially of our student work. Since the 
last conference a student division has 
been organized in the National Coun- 
cil. A commission has been appointed 
and two meetings held to determine 
whether the colored student work 
should come under the Colored Work 
Department or the Student Division. 
The present recommendation of the 
Commission is that the present organ- 
ization continue but that the matter be 
studied further. 

b. It is necessary to carry on our 
department of the work along race 
lines as the Negro represents a true 
human interest group. This raises an 
important interracial question. No 
longer can we fail or hesitate to look 
facts in the face. Although Negroes 
recognize branches as necessary in face 
of local conditions, it is also the only 


87 





way to develop leadership. But there 
is a growing feeling that the presence 
of this group along racial lines should 
not operate to exclude Negroes from 
any part they are able to fill in the As- 
sociation Movement. They should be 
recognized as an integral part of the 
Movement. 

c. There is a problem of the rela- 
tion between State and National Serv- 
ices, but this is not much of a problem. 
The need is so great that we have no 
disposition to scrap over who should 


render the service. We have the heart- 
iest cooperation of state committees 
everywhere and work in splendid coop- 
erative spirit. 

d. There is the problem before us as 
to how we can improve our service to 
local associations. Statistics show a re- 
gression in membership in spite of ad- 
ditional equipment and the opening of 
new fields. The same thing is true in 


participation in physical education and 


in religious activities. 
e. Charts that are on display tell the 


story of our unoccupied fields. The 
condition in the Eastern and Central 
Region is fairly good, but the situation 
in the Southern Region is deplorable. 
It is our responsibility as a group and 
our responsibility as a conference to see 
that this situation is remedied. 

d. We have done little on the task 
that Max Yergan left us to finish. We 
shall have an opportunity to fulfill ou; 
pledge to Yergan. China wants to try 
the experiment of an American Negro 
as an Association worker. 





“Jim-Crow Travel 


A Southern white man once said 
that the “Jim-Crow” car more than 
any single thing, would, if he were a 
Negro, drive him out of the South. 
Travel for the ordinary colored citizen 
in the South is a nightmare of discom- 
fort, insecurity and insult. The pres- 
ent practices are illegal even on the 
basis of the South’s own laws; they 
cheat poor citizens by making them 
pay first class fares for third class ac- 
commodations; in inter-state travel 
they contravene national law and court 
decisions, and they seriously interfere 
with work and efficiency. We present 
two illustrative instances, the first by 
a colored woman, the second by a white 
man. 


ESTERDAY, March 29th, I left 

Daytona Beach, Florida, for De- 
land, at 8 A .M. on a bus that runs 
from Daytona Beach to Orlando. 
There was one other colored pas- 
senger going to Deland, a _ lady 
who lives in Daytona Beach and 
teaches in Deland. I attended to 
my business at the Court House 


88 


there (concerning my taxes) looked 
around the town and returned to 
the bus station about 1:10 P. M. to 
wait for the 2:45 bus. About 1:45 I 
went to the ticket agent to buy my 
ticket and was told I could not get it 
until the bus arrived, so when it came 
I went to the agent and asked for a 
ticket to Daytona Beach. The agent 
said: “You can’t go on this bus.” I 
asked why, and he said: “There is no 
room for you.” I looked in the bus 
and saw a vacant seat, the one I sat 
in going to Deland. I called the 
agent’s attention to it and he said: 
“You cannot occupy that seat.” Two 
white ladies occupied the other two 
seats (which are three in one). I asked 
again the objection to my sitting there 
and he said: “Because you can’t.” I 
told him I sat in it coming over to 
Deland, but he paid no attention to me. 
A white couple drove up and asked if 
they could get seats in the bus and was 
told by a white young man who seemed 
to be a porter at the station that they 
could be accommodated. A white man 
who went over on the 8 A. M. bus and 


returned in the 2:45 P. M. got out 
at Deland and his seat (I think) was 
given to the couple. As the agent re- 
fused to sell me a ticket and as I ex- 
pected to be met in Daytona, soon after 
the bus arrived there, I went around to 
the side of the bus next to the vacant 
seat and asked the lady if there was 
any objection to my sitting there (as 
she had a wrap I think on the seat). 
She said: “None whatever.” At this 
juncture the porter came around and 
opened a rear door and pointed to 4 
camp chair, packed above and around 
with baggage, and said: “This is the 
only place you can sit on this bus.” 

refused it and went in the bus, the lady 
moved her articles and I sat down 
The porter on one side and the agent 
on the other, then ordered me out and 
when I would not get out, the collec- 
tor of tickets came up and asked for 
my ticket. I told him I had none, 9 
he said: “Get out then.” Some of the 
passengers began to protest, so the 
agent told them that, ‘Down here we 
don’t allow colored people to sit by

RISIS 








THINK that out of one hundred 

and twenty million people, this man 
may find a wife of his own race, if he 
seeks diligently enough. To be happy 
and contented is one of man’s great 
objects in life and it takes all of his 
skill and ingenuity to obtain this de- 
sire with everything in his favor, much 
less trying to stem the tide and be 
happy with all the barriers against 
one. I believe if he seriously consid- 
ers the barriers named by the Editor 
in the January Crisis and takes to 
himself a wife of his own race, I will 
venture that after a few short years 
he will bless the name of the Editor 
of the Crisis for having called his at- 
tention to these obstacles. 

Sometimes when love is blind, then 
reason must lead. 


Mrs. Ext Roserts, 
Aberdeen, South Dakota. 





By all means the young man should 
persuade the girl to marry him. He 
loves her and she loves him. What 
more could one want in life. It is 
not color that counts in love, but the 
one you most desire. This young man 
will make the great mistake of his 
life if he does not marry the one whom 
he loves. He will never be happy 
again in life even if he marries one of 
his own race. Love knows no color 
line. 

I, myself, am a young colored girl 
but I carry no racial prejudice in my 
heart, nor do I draw any color line. 
It is not God’s way. We who call 
ourselves Christians should do all that 
we can to break the barrier that sepa- 
rates the two races. 


Corris L. Richardson, 
New Rochelle, New York 


You may call it God, evolution, the 
nature of things, or by any other name 
you please, but we do know that there 
is as great a variety of the human spe- 
cies in the world as there are of plants 
and animals. And that each species of 
plants, animals, etc., seem to realize 
and obey the natural law, that separate 
and keep it within its bounds. 

_By natural preservation of the spe- 
cies of both the lower animals and 
plants, each one has been able to re- 
tain their identity. Of the plants, the 
oak, for hundreds of thousands of 
years, has remained the. oak. The 
linden, the pine tree still remains the 
pine, etc. The same law holds good 
of the insects, birds and beasts. The 
bluebird, redbird and brown thrush, 
have each retained its identity. And

Inter-Marriage: A Symposium 





In the January Crisis we pub- 
lished a letter from a young white 
man who sought advice on marry- 
ing a colored girl. We replied to 
him editorially and then asked our 
readers to comment. They did so 


in February and now again this 
month. 





even the domesticated animal, unless 
by interference of man, continues to 
preserve its species. And thus it is 
true of the human family, that has 
proceeded to divide itself into different 
species or races of men, who have 
reached the highest development in- 
tellectually, physically and _ socially, 
there must be rules or laws governing 
the society of which each of us are a 
part to keep each one within a law ade- 
quate for the protection of racial dif- 
ferences or identity. 


My advice to the youth and doubt- 
less innocent girl, is “to watch your 
step.” 

Mrs. M. C. Hamblin, 
Los Angeles, California. 


If you are positive that you are in 
love with the young colored woman 
to whom you referred in your letter to 
Dr. Du Bois, and have ample proof 
that she loves you, I see no good rea- 
son for permitting racial and religious 
differences to deter your marrying her. 


After all, love is the most essential 
factor in life and to deny yourself the 
wholesome affection and companion- 
ship of a morally clean and intelligent 
girl merely to live up to certain time- 
worn conventions of society, is a cruel 
outrage. 

Walter S. Robinson, 
Corona, New York. 


The root of these difficulties run 
deeply into the soil of sexual jealousy. 
White men are usually preoccupied 
with the dread of black men creating 
an intimacy with white women. They 
seem to think that social equality is the 
ultimate goal of the Negro. This is 
not true. Negroes simply want an op- 
portunity to develop themselves as 
other races and to be treated as Amer- 
ican citizens. Of course they do not 
object to the intermingling of those 
who wish it; nor do they ask it of 
those who do not desire it. They sim- 
ply ask that if inter-marriage should 
occur between the races, white people 
—yes, and colored people, too—should 
treat such couples with the courtesy 
and respect of civilized people, and not 


with the scorn and prejudice of sav- 
age tribes. 

This is not a plea for amalgamation. 
Amalgamation needs no plea. While 
we sit wondering, amalgamation moves 
on with irrisistable force. The ques- 
tion is: should it go on _ endlessly 
through the shameful channel of bas- 
tardy, or should it be brought within 
the bounds of law by racial inter- 
marriage? 

E. David Craig, 
Chicago, IIl. 


I was reared in a caucasian neigh- 
borhood, I and my sister, being the 
only colored girls. My playmates be- 
came Joe and Charles, two little 
white boys. Joe was the son of foreign- 
born German parents. From the age 
of three and four years old up to 
twelve and thirteen years, Joe and I 
played together without one quarrel. 
Joe attended a Catholic school, but we 
managed to meet each day after school. 
Then when Joe was ready for high 
school, he went to the public school. 
My first heartache came when I no- 
ticed Joe would walk home from school 
with white girls. But when I got 
within a few blocks of my home, he 
would join me. He used to always 
nickname me Brown Teddy. So this 
day, in a hurt tone, he began as fol- 
lows: 

“Brown Teddy, I missed you when 
you were away last year. Do you re- 
member the good times we have always 
had together? I want to tell you 
something,” he continued. “Josephine, 
(his sister) tells Dad I walk home 
with you, and the old man throws a 
fit. I told him you were as nice as 
any of the white girls, but Dad says, 
white people cannot go with colored 
people. White boys can’t make a liv- 
ing if they marry colored girls.’ Dad 
likes you, but that’s the reason. So, 
Teddy, I will not be seeing you often, 
but when I finish school and get work, 
I’ll make enough money so you and I 
can get married and then go some- 
where else and live. But promise to 
see me once every week.” 


So from that day on, on account of 
hurt pride and the advice of my moth- 
er, Joe was sort of forgotten. But 
wherever we met, Joe always without 
any embarrassment saluted me very 
cordially. My first beau had always 
been Joe’s enemy, a mulatto boy, who 
passed for white at school and public 
places. Joe knew he was colored. 
Well, Joe approached me and men- 
tioned our bargain. I was now six- 
teen and Joe seventeen. I asked Joe 


89 


to release me from my promise as 
Mother had advised me, too. He cried 
and I cried, too. Well, at the age of 
nineteen I married a mulatto man. I 
have been married seven years and am 
the mother of a son. Joe’s father has 
died. Joe is twenty-seven years old, 
and has never married. His mother 
and sisters blame me because I hurt 
their Joe. Joe speaks, but he seems 
so sullen and sad. I love my husband. 
But I hate to meet Joe face to face. 
His blue eyes hold a story. 


Pittsburgh, Pa. 


The question of intermarriage be- 
tween the races brought up in the let- 
ter written you by the young man seek- 
ing advice and on which you ask the 
opinion of your readers is one which 
is hurled at white people, who, like 
myself, believe in a square deal for 
people of all races. It is the sensa- 
tional thing that seems to catch the 
imagination of those ignorant people 
who know nothing about the whole so- 
called question but think they can 
“stump” you by bringing it up. It 
was flung in the face of Lincoln until 
he finally exclaimed, “Just because I 
don’t want a black woman for a slave 
it doesn’t follow that I want a black 
woman for my wife. There are plenty 
of black men to marry the black wo- 
men and plenty of white men to marry 
the white woman.” 

Whenever the “Negro question” is 
brought into the conversation whether 
in an economic or humanitarian way 
this irrelevant question is always 
brought up. Personally I am sick and 
tired of hearing it because it has so 
little to do with what the Negroes and 
the friends of Negroes are seeking. 
But when it does arise in the sincere 
way appearing in THe Crisis I think 
I should answer as you did. For my- 
self I usually reply that if the young 
colored man who wished to marry my 
daughter were all that I would wish in 
a young white man I should have no 
objection on account of his race but 
I should be very unhappy to think of 
the insults and ostracism they would 
both have to endure and I should 
point this out to my daughter as 
vividly as possible. As I have a 
daughter who has no race prejudice I 
know what I am talking about. 

With the assistance of a very kind 
letter of introduction from yourself I 
interviewed many Negro leaders 
throughout the South this fall as I did 
in the East last summer and I am 
convinced that this question plays a 
very small part in their efforts to ob- 
tain a square deal. To me it is a fool- 
ish thing to always bring up this ques- 
tion and ignore the one of promiscuous 
and illegitimate children. Why can 


90 


these short sighted people not see that 
the occasional marriage between the 
races would be a benefit if it would 
help to do away with this tragic thing 
which gives innocent children the dou- 
ble burden of color and illegitimacy. 
It would seem that in the minds of 
many the thing that is hidden is right. 
It is a very selfish attitude. 


May I thank you for putting this up 
to your readers and for allowing them 
to have their “say”. THE Crisis is 
read from cover to cover in our home. 

Hortense Reese, 


Minneapolis, Minn. 


My first impulse upon reading of 
my white friend’s expert execution of 
almost incredible New Year’s Resolu- 
tions—(“I do not smoke, drink, dance, 
play cards, rarely go to a movie, etc.”’) 
—is to tell him to place a great period 
to his marriage desires for the reason 
that “Saint heart ne’er won fair lady.” 
But a most corroding pity attacked me 
when I considered the question in his 
behalf. I am thereby writing you and 
liim out of a purified spirit. 

The pity arose out of a dream; the 
dream out of a remembrance of “The 
Comet” in Darkwater. My vision 
went so far as to imagine all the world 
reduced to white women and one man, 
a colored man, who was a corpse; and 
they standing over him. I saw in that 
picture a sudden uprush of belated de- 
sire, forcibly suppressed because there 
was nothing else possible; desire rising 
out of their mouths and eyes and 
breasts, like a many-tongued flame. 


My vision may seem to be off the 
point; but doesn’t it emphasize the 
everlasting, inevitable connection be- 
tween humanity and the individual; 
between the general and the particular? 
If you reverse the complexion of my 
dream—to all colored women and one 
white man—or the sex—to all colored 
men and one white woman, or the com- 
plexion and the sex—to all white men 
and one colored woman—the picture 
is the same. When you reduce human- 
ity or sex to its lowest common de- 
nominator, it matters not what the 
numerator, it is still just humanity or 
sex. But raise it again by involutions 
of color and society multiples and it’s 
something else. And I pitied this 
white gentleman, you and me for 
variant reasons on the same theme: 
him, because he had to desert the per- 
fectly sensible teaching of his upbring- 
ing—of loving colored people as a race 
—and love a colored individual; you, 
because you advocate miscegenation as 
a principle (if the participating par- 
ties are agreeable to it) and deny it in 
almost every individual case; and me, 
because I think it mandatory and un- 
avoidable, as an act of courage, when 


the individual case arises, but a horrj- 
ble thing to think about as a general. 
zation, as I do all generalizations 
(even that last one). And yet all 
three of us believe that people ought 
to marry whom, when, and for what 
reasons they please, and have an end 
on it, 


But to clear up my vision: The 
spectacle I pictured was on the basis 
of love in humanity being the out. 
standing phase of marriage, sex of love, 
and desire of sex; with desire, as a 
result, the outstanding phase of mar- 
riage. That is the central motive. The 
counter motive finds inequality the 
chief opponent of all marriage, caste, 
the chief phase of inequality, and race, 
in this case, the chief measurement of 
caste. Thus, my dream reduced all 
human marriage to desire as a central 
motive, all inequality to race as counter 
motive and used a numerical basis as 
an additional reducer. My result you 
have seen. Which means that I be 
lieve that at bottom the central mo 
tive ought to be successful always, ex- 
cept when it cannot possibly be, or in 
other words, that if people want each 
other they ought always to take each 
other, except when they can’t. When 
the central motive is defeated, there is 
always tragedy of some sort. 


So much for the theoretical side of 
it. You and your friend in trouble 
might appreciate my talking awhile in 
the direction of the point instead of 
away from it, if perchance there are 
even two grains of wheat hidden away 
amongst the chaff. I should like, then, 
to ask three questions, answer them 
and then twitch my blue mantle to be- 
take myself with your very willing 
permission to fresh woods and new 
pastures. The questions are: 

1. If marrying a certain girl means 
more to one than anything else in the 
world: that is, if not marrying her 
means more spiritual ruin than going 
along as now or than marrying her, 
why should there be any hesitation 
about choosing the most logically prof- 
itable of three possible goods? 


2. If, isolating the simple obstacle 
of race or caste and choosing any other 
motive or sub-motive which might be 
counter to marriage, a substituted 
counter motive could not be as great 
in importance as the central motive 
(marriage) why hesitate on the simple 
bugaboo of race? 


3. If one is not sure one’s love will 
transcend all things, of whatever kind, 
some of which are sure to oppose It, 
why plan to get married at all? 


As you see, I have given my own 
answers by merely asking the questions. 
I think it an eternal pity that people 
accept willingly the possibility of all

other persecutions whatever when 
planning to marry and shy away at 
once from race persecutions. I think 
‘t an even greater pity that you whose 
spirit and genius I respect above that 
of almost any other living man should 
admit that you would discourage an 
interracial marriage on grounds ob- 
viously less portentous and less fraught 
with danger of happiness than many 
things of which you would have proba- 
bly given no notice, like sex incom- 
patibility, temperamental unfitness or 
drunkenness. Or have you suddenly 
become aware that the 18th Amend- 
ment is more powerful than its fellows, 
the 13th, 14th, and 15th, and conse- 
quently more in need of neglect? 


Personally, I hope the gentleman 
and his wife (whom he shall certain- 
ly marry) have a great time together. 
[ hope also he will report back to us 
his “experience” in a course of years. 
I want to take this occasion, finally, to 
exclaim to all “eligible” white women, 
“Aroint ye from my path,” for though 
I can solve this problem easily enough 
for someone else, I prefer not having 
it in my own fingers. 

Yet I do wish I could hear the brave 
silent woman’s side of it. 


John Lovell, Jr., 
Philadelphia. 


Such a marriage union would set 
an example for the 100 per cent white 
gentlemen in the Southland who are 
ever ready to disgrace young colored 
girls and who by such illicit unions are 
filling the country over with mulattoes, 
quadroons and octoroons. ‘These 
unions as the world knows take place 
in sections below the Potomac without 
the sanction of the church or of the 
state, in face of the fact that in these 
sections laws are made to prevent col- 
ored and white persons marrying into 
each others families. The white man 
is instrumental in defeating his own 
laws; he is opposed to the black man 
marrying his daughter and yet, he 
makes possible these illicit unions. A 
voung brown-skin man was walking 
on the street with his wife, a woman 
of fair hair and complexion and a de- 
cided Anglo-Saxon in appearance. He 
was asked by his employer the next 
morning on going to work: “Did you 
marry a white woman?” ‘No, I mar- 
ried a white man’s daughter,” he an- 
swered. 

Robert W. Carter, 
Brookline, Mass. 





I am interested in the case of the 
white youth who asks your advice 
about marrying a colored girl. All 
the world should love a lover! You 


March, 1930 





are wise and kind to warn him of the 
difficulties but draw far too dismal an 
outlook. That he may meet with 
ostracism on the part of both races, as 
you state, if true is but partially so. 
On the other hand, the very boldness 
of the step may win him many friends. 
The willingness to sacrifice fortune, 
convention, place and even life itself 
in pursuit of the ideal has its re- 
wards even in what you consider this 
dark world. There is a growing 
number of liberals of all races who 
will approve his action. 

Strangely enough such liberals are 
largely found among two extremes: 
People who greatly value religion, 
(not sectarianism) and radicals who 
oppose religion. What our youth 
therefore needs is advice as to finding 
such liberals and also those sections of 
this our America that are most liberal, 
such as the larger cities of New York 
and New England, the northern part 
of the middle West, such as northern 
Ohio and _ Illinois, also Michigan, 
Wisconsin and Minnesota and the far 
west notably the State of Washington. 
It is not that liberals are confined to 
such areas. One will be amazed to 
find them as far South as Mississippi 
and Texas, although rare. On the 
other hand many bigots are in the 
regions mentioned as strongholds of 
liberalism. 

I recall with amusement entering a 
Washington, D. C., group of four 
white men who were discussing my 
own marriage to a white woman which 
eccurred seventeen years ago and con- 
tinues quite happy. One was an Ohio 
veteran of the Civil War, another a 
Kansas Quaker, the third a Mis- 
sissippian whose father fought under 
the Rebel General Forest and the 
fourth an Englishman then natural- 
ized. Their talk continued even after 
my appearance. The G. A. R. man 
was strong in attack, the Quaker equal- 
ly so in defense. When the Southerner 
was asked his opinion of my marriage 
he drawled, “I think he did the right 
thing!” The Englishman gave tacit 
approval. These men were all my 
friends before my marriage and con- 
tinued to be afterwards. In fact I 
have only in the rarest of instances 
been reminded of having lost any 
friends of either race because of this. 
Once some southern whites to whom I 
was recommended declined to receive 
me for this reason. ‘There is also a 
colored man, once a classmate of mine, 
who has refused to speak to me since 
my marriage and another who greets 
me always when alone, but whose eyes 
never meet mine if I am accompanied 
by my wife. As these people are all 
quite dull their attitude of aloofness 
saves me much embarrassment and 
adds to the gayety. 


Although during a life time I have 
favored inter-racial marriages I feel 
very kindly disposed toward those who 
disapprove. Years ago I once wrote 
a strong letter of protest to a friend 
who had it in view because he was a 
man of parts and so near the boundary 
between the so-called races that my 
fear was that his genius would be lost 
to the colored race if he took this step. 
Whether influenced by my letter I 
know not, but he did not, and now has 
three children identified with the col- 
ored race through an 
match. 


intra racial 

The value of inter-marriage is that 
it tends to increase the bond of fellow- 
ship between races, destroys prejudices 
and often produces clever and beauti- 
ful offspring. Consider the Eurasians 
and other vital stocks produced by 
racial mixing. Of the last there are 
countless illustrations. There comes 
to mind a family of Greater New 
York in which the husband and wife, 
white and black, are very ordinary peo- 
ple by human standards. But their 
three children are clever and beautiful 
beyond description. My own mar- 
riage though childless is happy. My 
wife is of solid English stock, with a 
long range of accomplishments and a 
granite character. She has always 
been my enthusiastic supporter, inspira- 
tion and helpmeet in my humble ef- 
forts to serve humanity. Believing in 
her as I do I have sometimes tried to 
show her accomplishments to friends. 
But this they must discover as she has 
all the English aversion to display of 
any kind. 


Advise your friends to place their 
contemplated union upon the high 
basis of principle and altruism. Let 
them hope through it to widen the 
horizons of people and thus serve hu- 
manity. If they are kindly disposed 
it is certain that they will make friends 
who will hold them so fully occupied 
as to keep their natures sweet and 
leave no time for worry or even to 
know about the ill wishes of others. 
Surely a true marriage is more than a 
mere union of bodies! 


“One crowded hour of glorious life 
Ts worth an age without a name!” 


There are few inter racial marriages 
in America now but the future holds 
promise of many. It is to be hoped 
that the clear vision and the wide in- 
fluence that are yours will be used to 
encourage them.

F we listen to the so-called educa- 

tional experts, we will find that 
there are many things wrong with 
American colleges. The chief malady 
they diagnose as too much extra-curri- 
cular activity. These seductive side 
lines not only snare the unsophisticated 
co-eds, but the furrowed professors as 
well. They claim that the only way 
these venerable guards of learning can 
increase their monthly stipends is to 
write hackneyed books, give nonsensi- 
cal lectures to equally nonsensical or- 
ganizations, or dissipate their time in 
many community enterprizes which 
take their attention from the classroom. 
The co-eds themselves only come to 
college for athletics or for social pur- 
poses. Both teaching and studying, 
they affirm, are as antiquated as the 
dodo. 

THere is no denying the fact that 
there is much in the criticism of the 
learned educators. A great deal of 
both studying and teaching could be 
done with considerable mcre benefit to 
the college in general, and the students 
in particular. But in spite of the su- 
per-abundance of freight that is clut- 
tering up the express and passenger 
lines, I maintain that there is one 
extra-curricular activity that could be 
stressed—nay, should be stressed—with 
many advantages. I refer to college 
dramatics. 

There are three or four good reasons 
why college dramatics should become 
more important on the cainpus. The 
first is; it should be used as a labora- 
tory for the objective teaching of the 
drama. As long as there are higher 
schools of learning, there will be 
courses in drama. No college is com- 
plete without Aeschylus, Shakespeare, 
Ibsen, and the other great characters 





that expressed life through this 
medium. 
A play is written to be acted. It is 


not a complete play until it unfolds it- 
self upon the stage. If we are going 
to teach it successfully, we must teach 
it in its true medium. The procedure 
in most of our colleges is to read the 
plays, note the historical background 
and sources, and apply to them a few 
rules of criticism gotten from another 
tedious book on technique. No mere 
reading of a play will do, for it is not 
written primarily to be read. 

It is surprising that with all our 
objective method of teaching, we do 
not carry it over into the field of

Some Whys and Wherefores of 


College Dramatics 
By RANDOLPH EDMONDS 


Mr. Edmonds is in charge of 
dramatics at Morgan College. His 
group of student players partici- 
pated in the Little Theater Tour- 


nament in New York last year and 
this year they have begun intercol- 
legiate dramatics with Hampton 
Institute. 


drama. This is a scientific age; and 
notwithstanding the fact that we are 
not all from Missouri, we demand 
proof for most things. In the natural 
sciences, the laboratories are the most 
important things about the courses. 
Very little that can be shown is left 
to theory. It should be the same way 
in the drama. To see an idea pro- 
jected on the stage, and by successive 
steps of action and dialogue run the 
gamut of human emotions is to get 
a better appreciation of the medium as 
an art form. If complexity of blood 
circulation can be better understood by 
watching the pulmonary action of a 
cat, the complex emotional reaction of 
an individual in a recognition scene 
can best be understood by observing it 
as it takes place before one’s eyes. If 
laboratories are necessary in biology, 
they are necessary in drama. The 
dramatic club is the best agency on the 
campus for the purpose. 

College dramatics not only affords 
the means for objectively teaching the 
drama, but all art. The requirements 
of the future will not be for more 
science, but more art. Science is 
shortening our working days so fast, 
that the future problem will be what 
to do with our leisure time. The only 
satisfactory thing so far is art in some 
form. Interested people never grow 
weary of their interest. The college 
must begin now to prepare people for 
that interest. 

Since art galleries, with many col- 
lections of works, are denied the aver- 
age college, the drama can be used 
more effectively in the beginning than 
any other. It is the greatest of all arts 
because it comes closer to life. It in- 
cludes the fundamentals of all the rest. 
It has the same interest in a story as the 
novel, and some of the finest poetry 
in the world. Since our modern stage 
is in the form of a picture frame, one 
can illustrate the balance and beauty 
of painting and sculpture. It has the 
rhythm and poise of dancing, and its 





sets represents the architecture of the 
ages; and in some of its great emo- 
tional places, where the soul is torn 
asunder by the problems of the uni- 
verse, we have the enobling effect of 
incidental music. Truly an inclusive 
art! We can only understand these 
things, however, as they are taught to 
us from a model before our eyes. The 
college dramatic club is the best place 
for this comparative study. 

The third advantage of college 
dramatics is that it creates a medium 
of cultural advertising. We have 
enough physical advertising: huge 
stadiums and mammoth gymnasiums 
are built. Expensive coaches are hired 
to turn out winning teams. The art 
of ballyhoo has been used to the great- 
est degree. The results have been a 
steady stream of advertised brawn 
from most of the colleges. The cul- 
tural stream is very small and sluggish. 
It consists of a few programs by the 
glee club, a few oratorical contests, 
and a few debates to which nobody 
goes. 

In spite of the increased interest in 
sports, as evidenced by the fact that 
most of the front pages on the final edi- 
tions of our newspapers are devoted 
to them, it must be remembered that 
the theatres draw more people in this 
country than sports. The thousands 
of highly capitalized playhouses in this 
country will bear witness to that. 

If handled rightly, there is a lot of 
publicity in college dramatics. In ad- 
dition it reaches an audience usually 
untouched by by the sport sheets. It 
reaches a class of people who worship 
the God of Beauty instead of the Gods 
of Football and Track. To reach this 
different audience is justification 
enough for the increased interest sug- 
gested. 

Some of the ways that the young col- 
legiates keep their play in the public’s 
mind are: to plaster the town with 
placards, run slides in all the movie 
houses in the vicinity, sending out sev- 
eral thousand letters, trailer announce- 
ments in public gatherings followed by 
hand bills, stunts and radio talks, and 
the regular photographs and stories in 
the newspapers. In fact, all of the 
publicity methods of athletics go into 
the production of a play. Thus we 
can see that college dramatics can be 
a very great asset in the cultural ad- 
vertisement of the school.

: Lost God 
By LILLIAN BYRNES 


| AM weary of your following, He 
said; 

The sound of pattering footsteps, in my 
ear 

Is not sweet music, following after 
mine ; 

(Can your tracks fit within my tracks? 
He said) 

Nor your mind’s futile pattering, like 
weak rain 


Upon a roof it trickles off in streams; 


Nor your hands’ grasping—reaching 
after me, 

Nor your pursuing prayers, like myriad 
arrows, 


Each with twin, poisoned shafts of 
Praise and seeking— 


No, nor your abject, incense-laden 
ee breaths 

ighing your vain desires—not these are

Guilty are these, my feet—that now

When you have said, “There is no god

When you have cried, ‘““There are no

When you have flung your forehead

Forgiveness 


OW I forgive; my heart is wet 

With the chill rain of its November 
And there are things I can forget— 
And things I shall remember. 


Thus it is well for you to come 
And sip my wine and break my bread, 
There will be much to say—and some 
Things will be left unsaid. . . 


Old dreams lie quiet in my thought 

Like cold fruit in a silver bowl 

That you must share—a man is naught 
If there’s no mirror for his soul. 


But you must hurry. Ever soon 
My hearth will be no longer warm: 
A bat will smash against the moon, 
A black cross split the winter storm. 


There is so much to say; words grow 
And tear my lips with restless wings! 
Yet, come to me before I go— 
Somehow, ghosts are wary things .

UT it was hard to think of her up 
there 

Not as a splendid queen upon a throne; 

Royal and cold she was, strapped to the 
chair 

And staring like a wraith on walls of 
stone. 

You did not think of flesh embraced in 
wire, 

Sweat upon steel, nor of black hair un- 
done— 

Rather, of fire riveted to fire, 

Something magnificent, lonely as the sun. 


Then, in the silence, little brooks of chill 

Poured through the room and spun in 
whirlpools where 

An interval of anguish broke to fill

Shantytown 
By GEORGE REEVES 


| WiLL get up and go now, 
and walk to Shantytown, 
over where the houses 

are like to tumble down. 


I will forget the heights, and 
the suburbs on the hill; 

I will ignore the stuck-up 
set from Eliteville. 


I'll mingle with the crowds on 
the jangling avenue, 

and go to where the smokestacks 
deny the sky is blue. 


Down along the tracks are 

a host of shouting boys, 

and both the white and black ones 
revel in the noise. 


And there the dandy youngbloods 
delight in seeming beer, 

and strut with gaudy girls from 
the cannery that’s near, 


Whose vivid splash of lipstick 
is all that is required 

to make the finest ladies 

as ever were desired. 


And when they all are mated, 
they occupy the shacks, 

and rear their many children 
with kisses and with whacks. 


All that’s necessary 

to make each shack a home 
is a loudly florid floor-lamp 
and a scratchy gramophone. 


I will get up and go now, 
and walk to Shantytown; 
folks live a jolly life there, 
and for a dollar down.

are among the most interesting educa- 
tional experiments of our day. Col- 
ored Students from America are par- 
ticularly welcomed at the International 
Peoples College, which is a folk uni- 
versity for students from different 
countries, founded at Elsinore in 
1921 and intended to serve “in the 
building of a bridge between nations 
by enabling students of foreign coun- 
tries to meet and study together.” 
Summer and winter sessions are held; 
the former from April 20 to July 10 
and the latter, from November 2nd to 
March 30th. The charges are low. 
Persons interested may correspond 
with THE CrislIs. 

Already two scholarships for col- 
ored students have been provided and 
it is hoped that colored organizations 
themselves will furnish further schol- 
arships. 

@ It is estimated that there are in 
Germany about 200 Negroes. Most 
of them are actors and musicians. In 
Berlin, a colored man named Brody, 
has gotten together fifty of these col- 
ored folk and staged a Revue. Brody 
was born in the Cameruns, a part of 
what was formerly German West 
Africa, and is an educated writer and 
actor. His revue is a picture of the 
cultural development of the Negro 
race. It will be given in a colored 
theater, which is a transformed res- 
taurant frequented by colored folk. 
There are thirty colored men, eight 
colored women, and three whites. Be- 
side this, there is a band and orchestra 
of fourteen.

Many of the greatest singers have been 
negligible as vocalists, while Mr. 
Hayes, even as vocalist, can claim pow- 
ers far, very far, from being negligible. 
Further, and not in a derogatory 
sense, Mr. Hayes is essentially a mini- 
aturist. The cameo in music is his 
field. In songs in which cameo-like 
arts of delineation and interpretation 
can be exercised Mr. Hayes seems to 
be without a peer.”’

MIDDLE SOUTH 


@ The Jackson, Miss. Daily News 
declares editorially: “The plain and 
brutal truth is that we have never 
given equal or adequate educational 
opportunity to the Negro children of 
our state.” Of Mississippi public 
funds, less than $6 a year per child is 
spent for Negro children and $26 a 
year for white children. Sixty per 
cent of the school population is colored, 
and this 60 per cent gets 20 per cent 
of the school fund, while the white 40 
per cent gets 80 per cent of the school 
fund.

and the groans of the injured. “I 
must wait for relief,” he said, in spite 
of the fact that his broken ribs were 
protruding through his sides. 

@ A new colored Community Center 
is being established by the Presbyter- 
ians at New Orleans under the Rev. 
U. D. Mooney, a white man. It will 
be modeled after the Little Mission in 
Louisville.

disbar, has won complete vindication 
before the Supreme Court of Missis- 
sippi. 


PACIFIC COAST 


@ Near Las Cruces, New Mexico, 
Negroes have entered 25,600 acres of 
government land. ‘These lands need 
irrigation and the white cattlemen are 
trying to starve the Negroes out. The 
Negroes are seeking money to dig ar- 
tesian wells. 

@ The Attorney-General of the State 
of California is being asked to rule on 
the right of a school board to segregate 
Mexican children from other children 
in one of the Santa Barbara public 
schools. 

@ Mary Anderson is the first colored 
girl to be admitted for nurse training 
at the University of California Hos- 
pital, San Francisco. She is domiciled 


in the nurses home and is only eighteen 


97 


years of age. She is a niece of Gar- 
land Anderson, the playwright. 

@ A suit is pending in California 
against the San Francisco News, 
which, in describing a well-known sa- 
loon on the “Barbary Coast”, referred 
to the proprietor as “a Portuguese Ne- 
gro”. He sued the newspaper for 
$50,000 because it called him a Negro. 
@ Robert L. Polk of Los Angeles has 
been given a Carnegie Hero medal of 
bronze and $1,000 for saving the lives 
of two deputy sheriffs when three con- 
victs were seeking to escape.

Superior Judge Vicini, Los Angeles, 
Cal., Mrs. Sallie Trainor is forbidden 
to occupy her own property at 160 
East 45th Street, or to permit any 
person who is not a Caucasian to live 
there for the next ninety-nine years. 
This was a decision in an action 
brought by neighbors for an injunction 
to compel the observance of race re- 
striction by contract in this area. 


WEST INDIES 


@ Edward S. Richardson, Postmas- 
ter at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, was 
born in Georgia in 1888; educated at 
Atlartta University, and worked for 
seven years as teacher under the Amer- 
ican Missionary Association. He mar- 
ried Pearl Grigsby, a graduate of 
Smith College. They have one child, 
a boy. Mr. Richardson was appointed 
Postmaster in the fall of 1929. His 
office acts as an exchange office for the 
sister islands of St. John and St. Croix, 
as well as for the British, French and 
Dutch West Indies. There is a force 
of eight: the Postmaster, six clerks, 
and the janitor, with no carriers. Mrs. 
Richardson has been asked to teach in 
the high school. 

@ The Panama Canal Zone Bar 
Association admits Negro members, At 
the last election, L. S. Carrington, a 
colored native of Barbadoes, was 
elected treasurer and W. C. Todd, a 
native of Nigeria, West Africa and a 
graduate of Lincoln and the Univer- 
sity of Michigan, was made a mem- 
ber of the executive committee. 


WEST AFRICA 


@ F. E. Cholerton, of the American 
Advisory Committee on Education in 
Liberia, is to succeed the late James 
L. Sibley. Cholerton has been mak- 
ing a study of education at Tuskegee 
and the Penn School. He apparently 
knows nothing of Howard, Fisk, At- 
lanta, Talladega and such institutions. 
@ The National Congress of British 
West Africa has held its 4th session 
at Lagoes, Nigeria. It sent greetings 
to American Negroes by cable to THE 
Crisis. 

@ The Catholic Vicar Apostolic of 
the Belgium Upper Congo has been 


98 





protesting against forced labor in the 
Congo. Few labor recruits are ob- 
tained voluntarily, and in some cases, 
nearly every man of the specified age 
is taken from the villages to work for 
the concessionary companies away 
from home. 

@ Miss Charity Zomelo, a native girl 
from the Gold Coast, British West 
Africa, has completed the course at the 
Summit High School, New Jersey. 
She has been educated by the Rev- 
erend Florence Randolph. 

@ The disturbances in South Eastern 
Nigeria where brave British troops 
killed black women, have not been yet 
thoroughly explained. The govern- 
ment of Nigeria summoned the editors 
of the local press and warned them of 
“grave consequences” if they should 
print too much. So far as can be 
learned, the trouble came through an 
attempt to lay a head tax on women. 
The women, ten thousand strong, de- 
stroyed over $50,000 worth of prop- 
erty; raided the government offices; 
broke open the prison and liberated 30 
prisoners. Most of the white people 
ran away pell-mell and they then 
brought in white and Negro troops 
armed with Lewis machine guns. 
Lieutenant R. N. Hill was the distin- 
guished officer who led the troops and 
gave the command to fire. Eight 
women were wounded; nineteen wom- 
en and one man killed by gun fire and 
ten women died of wounds. 

@ The French claim that they have 
at last stopped the decrease in popula- 
tion in Equatorial French Africa. 
Since 1921, the number of doctors and 
nurses has been doubled, and the bud- 
get increased from $100,000 to over 
$400,000. Two million four hundred 
and three thousand natives have been 
examined and 98,000 treated for sleep- 
ing sickness. 


SOUTH AFRICA AND 
AUSTRALIA 


@ Australia is having trouble with 
her immigrants. By national law, she 
will allow no colored immigrants, 
neither Mongolians nor Negroes. Now 
she is dissatisfied with the kind of 
white people that are coming in. 
Among her inhabitants are 55,000 col- 
ored Maoris, and the Australian 
Worker suggests a separate Maori 
state. 

@ On a Peninsular and Oriental boat 
sailing from Australia to England, 
there were Australians, New Zealand- 
ers and Maoris, who were exceedingly 
friendly. At Durban and Capetown, 
a number of South Africans joined the 
ship and immediately there was 
trouble. Some of the South Africans 
refused to go to the tables; others re- 
fused to play in the deck games. They 


sent deputations to the Captain and 
several times fights were imminent. 
At last, the Captain gave way and seg- 
regated the Maoris at separate tables 
in the dining room. 


@ The unrest among the natives of 
South Africa still continues. The lat. 
est seat of trouble has been Carnarvon 
and East London, Cape Colony. The 
natives are threatening to strike for 
higher wages and there have been many 
attempts at sabotage on the railroads. 


@ The government of the Union of 
South Africa has purchased the Bush- 
man paintings collected by Dr. Leo 
Frobenius. They have made him a 
grant of $25,000 for these paintings 
and for further research work. 


EAST AFRICA 


@ Little wars in Africa still go on but 
are beneath the notice of large news 
agencies. There is continued fighting 
in the Nuer country of the Egyptian 
Sudan, and in the Nuba hills “minor 
operations” have been made against 


Chief LaFofa. 

@ An Italian, Alberto Prasso, has 
obtained concessions for platinum min- 
ing in Abyssinia. He has floated a 
company in Paris with a capital of 


$360,000.

THE STORY OF 
RONALD JOSEPH 

T was not until I was eleven years 

old that I knew what my mother 
looked like. When I was very young 
she decided to come to the United 
States but could not afford to take me 
with her; a childless couple, friends of 
hers, Mr. and Mrs. Theophilus 
Joseph, adopted me. ‘This was in St. 
Kitts in 1910. A short while after 
the Josephs moved to the Island of 
Dominica where we stayed for ten 
years. In 1921, my foster parents 
also decided to come to the United 
States and it was then that I saw my 
mother. 

When I came to America, she had 
nothing to say against the way my 
foster parents had brought me up— 
there was no suggestion that I return 
to her. I live with my foster parents 
and pay weekly visits to my mother. 

My foster parents have done what 


they can to give me an education. The, 


lat two and half years of my high 
school period were spent in a private 
school, the Fieldston School of Ethical 
Culture, where I had obtained an Art 
Scholarship. The hours were so ar- 
ranged that it was not possible for me 
to work during the school term. I 
worked during the summer and was 
financed by my parents during the 
school term. 

[ obtained an art scholarship 
through Dr. Henry Fritz. I became 
acquainted with Dr. Fritz through my 
art teacher in public school. She 
heard that Dr. Fritz was opening a 
Saturday art class for children spon- 
sored by the School Art League and 
sent me to him. I was taken into the 
class; I was the only colored boy in 
it At our sixth annual exhibition a 
whole wall of the room in the Metro- 
politant Museum was set aside for my 
work only. This happened at the same 
time that I completed my art course in 
high school. 

T am now trying to get a scholar- 
ship to the Yale School of Fine Arts 
but would also like to get either a job 
as helper in an artist’s studio or as an

illustrator in order to work my way 
through Yale. 

If I do get into Yale, after I leave 
there I should like, to do imaginative 
work. I shall not try to copy any- 
one, just working my own way and 
using my own ideas. 


The above is the autobiography of 
Ronald Joseph, who recently exhibited 
60 charcoal watercolors and crayon 
drawings at the Metropolitan Museum. 
Dr. Henry E. Fritz arranged an- 
nually to have the work of the 30 most 
gifted children which he has found 
exhibited. Joseph is the first pupil of 
Dr. Fritz who has done work which 
merited an individual section. He is, 
as Dr. Fritz believes, the first reward 
which the city has received for the se- 
lect experimental class in art which 
Dr. Fritz organized six years ago. 
Ronald Joseph is not only interested in 
art; he is an athlete, winning second 
place recently in the inter-scholastic 
high jump; is gentle in manner, and 
has always been interested in draw- 
ings. He says in a recent interview: 

“Some things stand out very clearly 
about my drawing, because I used to 
annoy people so,” he said. “In school 
the kids would draw ships on their 
slates. They'd begin by drawing a dia- 





gram of the kitchen. Instead of leav- 
ing them alone I’d run around and 
say, ‘You don’t see a ship that way.’ 

“From the time I was very little I 
used to want to draw things in the 
market place, the bright colors, the 
feeling in the heat.” 


Recently, William Pickens, Field 
Secretary of the N. A. A. C. P., 
lectured at the Lincoln School, 
New York City. He talked on the 
subject of races. The children were 
much interested and asked ques- 
tions. Among other things, Mr. 
Pickens showed how the present 
conditions in Africa are the result 
of generations of slave trading and 
exploitation. After his lecture, the 
teacher found on her desk the fol- 
lowing poem written by one of the 
students. The teacher writes: 
“Isn't it rather a challenge to those 
who think fourteen and fifteen year 
old boys and girls do only childish 
things?” 


Remorse 
By IVRIA ADELBLUM 
WE stole you from the jungle, 


From the swaying palms 
And the singing birds. 
We robbed you of your happiness ; 
We crushed your spirit 
And numbed your soul. 
We brought you to a world of trouble. 
We took away your freedom 
And made you slaves. 
So that we might sing and dance, 
Someone had to do our labor. 
Now we have freed you; 
But we keep you apart, 
Because you are black, and we are white. 
There’s a tall thick wall between us. 
We robbed you, used you, 
And dropped you by the wayside. 

* * * « x « 
You might have cleared the tangled 

jungle, 

With its tall slim trees 
And its chattering monkeys. 
You might have tamed your land, 
And turned it into a beautiful country. 
We stole you from it all. 
I am ashamed.

PATIENT ASSES 


MET my friend one morning on 

Seventh Avenue as we were hurry- 
ing opposite ways to our work. She 
asked : 

“Did you attend 
ture?” 

1 did not. 

She said: 
as sincere.” 

I quite agreed with her. 

And then she said: “You were wise 
in advocating Pan-Africanism.” 

I thanked her. I was glad that she 
saw the point. I wished again, as I 
have often wished, that other people 
would see it. Here was a statesman 
fronr the Union of South Africa. Ef- 
fort was made before his visit to the 
United States to commit the colored 
people to support of him and his policy 
in order that their action might in- 
fluence their colored brethren in South 
Africa. As he was about to arrive, a 
movement was put on foot to get col- 
ored leaders to sign a laudatory ad- 
dress and thank Jans Smuts for his 
South African Negro program! This 
was fortunately blocked. Then a quiet 
conference was arranged in Washing- 
ton by the Phelps Stokes Fund in 
which the program was confined to 
carefully restricted discussion of the 
American race problem and arranged 
so as to include no single Negro who 
had been in South Africa or had expert 
knowledge of the South African situ- 
ation. 


the Smuts lec- 


“He does not strike me 


N the meantime, however, Mr. 

Smuts, himself, supplied a good deal 
of missing information. He had no 
sooner opened his mouth at Town 
Hall, New York City, than he put his 
own foot deeply and completely in it. 
He compared Negroes to patient asses 
and wanted them to dance and sing! 
Negroes have been more patient than 
most asses and asses do not usually 
dance and sing. Indeed, the animals 
that dance and sing best are the least 
patient with demagogues like Smuts. 

Dr. Moton of Tuskegee, who among 
a half-dozen Negro leaders sat upon 
the platform, was the only one who 
had the courage to challenge Smuts 
then and there. We congratulate him 
upon the deed.

My dear Dr. Du Bois: 

I have been wanting a long time to thank you for your beautiful tribute 
to my brother, Moorfield Storey, in the December Crisis. He himself 
would have said it was too much—that he did not deserve it. But I think 
he did—as much as any man could deserve such high praise, for his heart 
was with you in the struggle against injustice and barbarity. I believe the 
last argument he made in any court was before the Supreme Court and 
in defence of Negro rights. His voice and manner were always so quiet 
that I do not think people realized how deeply rooted his feelings were 
on the side of the oppressed. I think it was perhaps his legal training 
which made him unwilling to appeal to emotion—but always to the people's 
sense of justice, and to their recognition of actual facts. He was not an 
orator. But he felt a deep disappointment in the lack of response that he 
met with everywhere—the settled indifference to any abuses—no matter 
what. I have been reading his Life of Sumner lately, and now I am reading 
your John Brown—I am more interested than in anything I have read for 
a long time. When it was published, I could not use my eyes and so only 
glanced over it, and now I am carried away by it. It is an epic like a 
Greek tragedy. It made me sick at heart last summer to see that book 
“John Brown’s Body”. I couldn’t read it. I am glad you are interested 
in Single Tax. I think it possibly would be the solution of many problems 
if it could be adopted—the Southern problem—and prohibition and war 
—for it would take the power from the ruling class. I feel sad for 


America. 


Mariana T. Storey. 


Smuts explained. He meant noth- 
ing derogative. He was compliment- 
ing Negroes. That is Smuts all over! 
Shrewd, wary, insincere, distrusted 
throughout South Africa by black and 
white, Boer and Briton, desperately 
trying to pose in Europe and America 
as a great Liberal and forever damned 
by his determination to keep black folk 
in eternal subjection to white, while 
salving the fools with fair words. 
Herzog, his opponent and the present 
Premier, is at least sincere. He is as 
narrow in his “Nigger” hatred as 
Smuts, but his narrowness is lack of 
knowledge and not deliberate and suave 


hypocrisy. Herzog wants to learn. 
Smuts will never learn. He knows it 
all now. 


ND he ought to know it. He and 
his party established the color 
caste of South Africa in its present 
form. From the founding of the 
Union of South Africa until 1924, 
Smuts has been a member of the Cabi- 
net and often Prime Minister. Dur- 
ing this time he helped establish and 
vigorously defended the following 
caste system for black men: 
1. Disfranchisement of all persons 
of Negro descent, except in Cape Col- 





ony, and even there Negro voters can 


not vote for Negro candidates. 


2. Disarming the natives by exclud- 
ing them from the militia. 

3. Depriving natives of their land 
and prohibiting them from _ buying 
land except in restricted areas. This 
legislation gave a million and a half 
whites 87 per cent of the land and 
five million natives 13 per cent. 

4. Excluding Negroes from the 
Civil Service. 

5. “Jim Crow” regulations for rail- 
roads and public buildings. There are 
separate Post Offices for blacks, either 
at the back of the white Post Office or 
underground. Even here, no native 
clerk is employed and natives must 
take off their hats when entering any 
public building. In some cases they 
cannot walk on the sidewalk. 

6. Direct taxation on natives, at the 
rate of $5 to $10 a year and using 
most of this money for the benefit of 
the whites, who pay no poll tax. 

7. Educational facilities are % 
meagre that 95 per cent of the natives 
are illiterate. In the Transvaal for 4 
long time the government grant 
native schools was about the same sum 
as they expended for the upkeep of ani 
mals in the Pretoria Zoo.

Crisis 








§. The pass system which compells 
every native to be registered and carry 
a pass without which he is subject to 
arrest and imprisonment. 

Some of these regulations do not ap- 
ply to persons of mixed blood and edu- 
cated natives not living in tribes, but 
even for them the caste discrimination 
and restrictions are humiliating and 
disgraceful and make South Africa the 
worst place on earth for colored folk 
to live. 

Conceive what would happen to an 
Englishman who had treated Irishmen 
in this way and who came to the 
United States to lecture? How many 
Irishmen would be sitting on his plat- 
form grinning at him? We certainly 
are patient asses. We shall never se- 
cure emancipation from the tyranny of 
the white oppressor until we have 
achieved it in our own souls. 





OW much might have been ac- 
complished for the advantage of 
Africa and the reputation of American 
Negroes if we had with quiet dignity 
refused to sit on Smuts’ platform and 
to go into conference with him except 
on the clear understanding that we 
would be perfectly free to demand 
from him an explanation of South 
African conditions and his part in mak- 
ing them. Why was it not perfectly 
in order for some member of that con- 
ference to ask Jan Smuts courteously 
but firmly why he had deliberately lied 
at Town Hall and told a questioner 
that an American Negro could buy 
land and live in South Africa? 
Meantime, can not everyone see how 
necessary it is for persons of Negro 
descent in all parts of the world to un- 
derstand their respective problems? 
How humiliating to see prominent 
American Negro leaders put them- 
selves in a position to appear as cats- 
paws against the plain wishes and in- 


terests of their blood brothers in 
Africa! 





HE problems of Negroes differ, to 
_be sure, the world over in many 
intricate and vital respects, but at bot- 
tom, they are the same: the political 
disfranchisement of Negro blood; the 
distortion of the facts of Negro history 
and accomplishment ; racial discrimina- 
tion in everyday life; limitation of edu- 
cation so as to increase black serfdom 
and white profits: “Jim-Crow” policies 
of all sorts and personal insult based 
on color of skin. 

The degree in which these various 
disabilities are applied differs in dif- 
ferent countries and at different times, 
but they are all present in some degree 
in every Negro group. It is, therefore, 
of the greatest importance that these 
Sroups understand each other; that 


March, 1930 





British Negroes stop criticizing and 
sneering at American Negroes; that 
American Negroes realize what British 
Negroes are accomplishing and endur- 
ing; that South Americans and West 
Indians cease making a white skin their 
one clear ideal; that African Negroes 
keep in close touch with their cousins 
overseas, and that all Negroes look to- 
ward the Black World in an effort to 
be intelligent and thoughtful and help- 
ful in the development of the black folk 
of all lands. 


This does not involve in the slightest 
degree any attempt needlessly and ig- 
norantly to interfere in the government 
or self-development or self-determina- 
tion of the different groups or any 
widespread migration; but it does call 
for intelligence and co-operation in 
every possible way and on the broadest 
scale. 

This is the deep and unanswerable 
demand for a Pan-African movement. 
Who will respond? 


OUR ECONOMIC PERIL 


ORTUNATELY, the attention 

of thinkers, black and white, is 
being drawn to the economic crisis 
which faces the American Negro. Nor- 
man Thomas, the white leader of 
American Socialists, writing in the 
New Leader, said recently: 


Jim Crow cars, poor schools, segre- 
gation, bad housing and exclusion from 
industrial opportunity make up the tale 
of the Negroes’ woes against which there 
is a rising tide of justifiable resentment. 
If anything, lack of economic opportunity 
in trades is growing worse and not bet- 
ter. This is in part a byproduct of tech- 
nological unemployment which increases 
the pressure for jobs; in part it is due 
to racial prejudice. There is, for in- 
stance, a shift in the South from colored 
to white barbers and waiters. I have 
previously referred to the outrageous ac- 
tion of a local of the Upholsterers’ Union 
here in New York in refusing a card to 
a Negro carpet layer on account of his 
color. Unions that follow this practice 
kill their own soul. 

It does not take much of a prophet to 
foresee the coming of a time when at 
last the white mill hands will strike 
against intolerable conditions. In the 
South many of the mills, especially those 
owned by Northern capital, will turn to 
Negroes. Economic war will be height- 
ened by racial feeling. The only way to 
avert such fate is to organize Negro 
workers as well as white workers and to 
assert an economic solidarity now before 
it is too late. 


George S. Schuyler, writing in the 
New York Times, says, on the other 
side: 

Comforting as is the idea of a self- 
sufficient group economy for the Negro 
to white people wedded to the ideal of 
racial separatism, we must face the facts 


of the situation. What the Negro needs 
now is not for a few philanthropists to 
give money to Negro schools and stop 
there, but for these same philanthropists, 
who own and control the industry and 
commerce of the country, to lower the 
color bars in their stores, factories, mills, 
warehouses and so forth, thus enabling 
the Negroes whom they have helped to 
educate to make a decent living and ad- 
vance in the social and economic scale, 
not as Negroes but as Americans. 

Meantime, neither the Trade Union- 
ists nor the Philanthropists are making 
any real movement to lift the Negro 
permanently away from _ starvation. 
The only way that the Negro can ac- 
complish this through his own efforts 
is to begin with consumers’ co-opera- 
tion. This is the reason that we have 
been devoting so much space lately in 
THE Crisis to explaining this road to 
economic independence. Negroes have 
tried it several times and have failed or 
succeeded for obvious reasons. Chain 
grocery stores in Memphis failed be- 
cause they were not really co-operative; 
they became organized for private 
profit and could not meet the compe- 
tition of white chain stores. Efforts in 
Philadelphia for the purchase of coal 
or other articles failed. 

On the other hand, the students’ co- 
operative store at Bluefield has been 
extraordinarily successful, not simply 
as a store, but as a school of business 
training. In New York City, there has 
been widespread buying of multiple 
homes on a co-operative basis. Some 
have failed; some have had fair suc- 
cess; a few have been very successful. 
There is no reason why with thought 
and study a large measure of success 
can not be obtained. 

Meantime, educated Negroes should 
listen carefully to the words of two 
men: Benjamin Stolberg, a white man, 
has recently emphasized the fact that 
the Negro problem is essential and pri- 
marily a labor problem and the next 
steps must be in the direction of labor 
organization. Abram Harris, a colored 
professor of Howard University, em- 
phasizes in this number of THE Crisis, 
the attitude of trade unions and the 


clear path which Negro labor must 
follow. 


BARBADOES 
EVERAL Barbadians have written 


me concerning a paragraph in the 
January Crisis. The paragraph said 
that in Barbados ‘Negroes have no 
chance to own land and are used as a 
reservoir of common labor.” This state- 
ment was, of course, too sweeping—if 
interpreted as meaning that no persons 
of Negro descent in all Barbadoes 
owned land. Naturally, there are many 
landowners, merchants and civil serv- 
ice employees of Negro descent in that 


101 





island. But for the mass the situation 
is this: There are 106,470 acres on 
which a population of 169,385 are liv- 
ing. Much of this land is monopolized 
by large plantations and absentee land- 
holders for the raising of sugar-cane, 
cotton and other crops. That means 
that the great mass of the people are 
not able to buy or rent land at any 
reasonable price and can not become 
peasant-proprietors, as for instance, in 
Jamaica. For this reason, thousands of 
them have migrated from time to time 
and Barbadians have been the chief 
laborers on such great works as the 
Panama Canal. Their work has been 
important and valuable, but wretchedly 
paid because of the necessity of selling 
their labor at a low price. 

We were referring to these facts in 
the paragraph mentioned. 


THE COURTESY LIST 


HAVE for some time been mean- 
[ ing to publish a list of those 
American publishers and _ periodicals 
which capitalize the word “Negro”. 
The following list is admittedly in- 
complete, but it is worth scanning: 

The Atlantic Monthly 

The Century Magazine 

The American Mercury 

The New Republic 

The Nation 

The Virginia Quarterly 

The New York World 

The Herald-Tribune 

The Encyclopedia of the Social 
Sciences 

The United States Census 

The Macmillan Company 

Doubleday, Doran and Company 

Duffield and Company 

Harcourt, Brace and Company 

Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. 

There are doubtless other names 
that ought to be included here which 
I do not now recall. Will my friends 
remind me? Meantime, let us not 
forget that the following institutions 
persist in what must now be regarded 
as a deliberate insult to twelve million 
Americans:

Biography

AN APPOINTMENT 


HE appointment of Charles S. 

Johnson as the American repre- 
sentative on the commission which is 
to inquire into slavery in Liberia is a 
step of unusual significance. The 
United States Government has been 
extremely wary in allowing itself to 
be represented officially by an Ameri- 


102 


can of Negro descent. ‘lo be sure, 
we have had ministers in the past to 
Haiti and Liberia, but these repre- 
sentatives concerned only the two 
countries directly. If our memory is 
not deceived, never before in an inter- 
national commission, where a body like 
the League of Nations is represented 
by white men, has the United States 
nominated a colored man to represent 
this country. President Hoover de- 
serves credit, not simply for the ap- 
pointment, but for the character and 
ability of the man whom he appointed. 
Mr. Johnson, together with representa- 
tives of the League of Nations, and a 
representative of the government of 
Liberia, will investigate the widespread 
charge of the existence of slavery in 


Liberia. 


THE BOYCOTT 

IDE by side with consumers’ co- 

operation, and of greater initial 
importance because it can so easily be 
put into force, stands the boycott as a 
weapon which American Negroes can 
use for their economic defense. Boy- 
cotting consists of concerted refusal to 
trade with a particular store or firm 
until it meets a group’s wishes in re- 
spect to treatment, conditions of work, 
personnel, prices, etc. In America, it 
has to be used with care and under 
careful legal advice because merchants 
and manufacturers have so hedged 
themselves about with laws that boy- 
cotters may find themselves open to 
prosecution for interfering with the 
firm’s profits! 

Nevertheless, the method can be and 
has been widely used. The Consum- 
ers’ League has brought pitiless pub- 
licity to bear upon firms which mis- 
treat and underpay their employees. 
And recently, in Chicago, the Chicago 
Whip, a paper owned and conducted 
by Negroes, has been carrying on a 
widespread campaign to compel firms 
catering to Negro trade in the Chicago 
black belt to hire Negro clerks. 

This touches a matter of deep in- 
justice to Negroes. Not only in chi- 
cago, but in practically all large cities, 
like New York, Philadelphia, Pitts- 
burgh and Indianapolis, not to mention 
all Southern towns and cities, the 
white storekeepers in the Negro dis- 
tricts monopolize the Negro retail 
trade, often neglect and even grossly 
mistreat and cheat their colored cus- 
tomers, and to cap the injustice, hire 
no colored help. Personal treatment 
of the colored customer in later years 
has greatly improved, but with few 
exceptions, the independent firms and 
particularly the chain stores, insist on 
putting white clerks and managers 
over their black belt stores. 


This is a double injustice. First 


and foremost, it cuts down tremend. 
ously the opportunities for work 
among trained colored workers, and 
secondly, it establishes an impossible 
economic caste. 

To combat this, there is one tremen- 
dous and most effective weapon. The 
colored people have a right, after ascer- 
taining the facts, to agree among them- 
selves not to trade with certain stores 
until they either get better treatment 
or until the stores hire colored clerks, 
or until other changes in policy are 
made. Sometimes, the attack should 
be directed toward the kind of goods 
sold in the black belt. It is common 
custom in New York, for instance, to 
dump old and spoiled goods in the col- 
ored district and sell them at high 
prices. 

The success of the campaign carried 
on by the Chicago Whip has appar- 
ently been most encouraging. It be- 
gan with a survey of the South side 
business concerns of all types which de- 
pend partially or solely upon colored 
people for support. This showed an 
easy possibility of openings for seven 
thousand colored employees in these 
establishments. After this, an investi- 
gator carefully counted the white and 
colored patrons of the different places 
in the course of the day for a period 
of time, until it was possible to de- 
termine the volume of colored busi- 
ness. A representative of the newspaper 
then approached the proprietor. He 
pointed out the trade that he was get- 
ting from colored people; the fact that 
neither he nor his clerks lived in the 
district ; that they did not deposit their 
money in colored banks; that they did 
not patronize colored restaurants; or 
other colored enterprises. In other 
words, that they were content to take 
all and leave nothing. 

The replies of the merchants were 
taken down and published by the 
Whip. The Whip then proceeded to 
get the aid of churches, clubs, organi- 
zations and prominent people, and 
held monthly meetings. The result of 
five months of this campaign was that 
over 400 people secured positions di- 
rectly through the office of the Whip 
and some 600 indirectly. ‘The goal 
set by the Chicago Whip is five thou- 
sand positions before the spring of 
1930!” ; 

This is but the beginning. Public 
accommodations, like telephones and 
street cars, should be attacked. Meter 
readers for electric light and gas com- 
panies should be demanded. Large 
manufacturers should be confronted 
with the facts. All this propaganda 
must have back of it the organized de- 
termination of large numbers of col- 
ored people to withdraw their patron- 
age from recalcitrant merchants, unless 
they yield.

statistics were: the fact of an undim- 
inishing birth-rate, only a moderate 
number of deaths from pulmonary 
troubles, and a favorable amount of 
property owned in relation to the sal- 
aries of the wage earners. 

However, the most significant, to the 
average reading citizen, would prob- 
ably be those figures which show the 
cultural and educational achievements 
of the group. Representatives from 50 
of these families have had European 
travel, 20 have the degree of Master 
of Arts, 5 have the degree of Ph. D., 
and 5 are Phi Beta Kappa members 
out of 40 who have attended colleges 
where it is granted. There are many 
others who are without degrees, yet 
who are teachers and professional per- 
sons of great influence and high stand- 
ing in their respective communities. 

Yet, this study was by no means at- 
tempted as any proof of the superiority 
of the mixed blood over the full- 
blooded Negro. In fact interesting 
comparisons have occurred all through 
the compilation of the data, to refute 
such a theory. The two wealthiest 
men of the group were, one almost 
white and one almost black; and again 
two of the most intellectual, were exact 
opposites as to color and type.

YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION 


There are 78 colored Y.M.C.A.’s in the United States; 30 of these have dormi- 
tories. The following associations are supporting this advertisement: 


DENVER, COLORADO 
Glenarm Branch, 2800 Glenarm St. 
With dormitory 


NEW YORK, N. Y. 
181 W. 135th Street, With dormitory 


PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA 
Center Avenue Branch, Center Ave. at Francis 
St., With dormitory 


BALTIMORE, MARYLAND 
Druid Hill Avenue Branch, 1619 Druid Hill 
Avenue, With dormitory 


Perbaps a dozen people have said to me since the appearance of the Crisis ad., ‘I bad no idea of the extent and scope of 
the work of the Y. M. C. A. among the colored people.’ 
effect of this in creating a feeling of dignity and pride on the part of the membership in a nation-wide and forward 
looking organization, will in my opinion, be fruitful of results all out of proportion to the expense involved, looked at from 
I make no apology to anybody for looking at it from this angle.” 


However, some of the older theories 
concerning mulattoes do seem to be 
refuted by the data concerning this 


group. One is, that in the third gen- 
eration mulattoes become infertile, an- 
other that the mental and_ physical 
calibre of mulattoes is inferior to either 
parent stock. Perhaps, most vicious of 
all is the popular supersitition that two 
fair colored people or one colored per- 
son fair enough to be mistaken for 
white, and a white person, are apt to 
produce a black child. We have found 
no evidence to prove the truth of any 
of these theories.

in all the time preceding it. And the 
condition which is now beginning to 
cast its light before, is one in which all 
men shall be given opportunity on a 
human, not a color, basis. In the 
progress which has been made, and it 
is an immense progress, the N. A. A.

to be seen whether the gains can be 
consolidated, the advance assured, the 
work gloriously begun carried to 
fruition. This is the opportunity and 
the challenge offered by the Moorfield

Campaign for the year 1930. Let no 
one ever complain of his lot if, hav- 
ing the opportunity to contribute to 
this work, he now fails to do all in 
his power.

whites.” At that time a crowd began 
to collect and a cop whom the agent 
called came up and yelled at me as if 
I were inhuman, to get out at once. 
I was very nervous by that time and 
remembering what a lady member of 
my race suffered at the hands of white 
ruffans at Palatka during the winter 
and not knowing anyone in Deland to 
protect me, I got out. There was no 


103 











way for me to reach Daytona Beach 
by rail except via an out-of-the-way 
route, but I had to resort to it. By 
inquiring at the colored section I got 
a gentleman to drive me to Lake 
Helen, where I had to wait a long time 
for a train, which would bring me to 
New Smyrna. When I reached there 
I found I could not leave there until 
2 A. M. for Port Orange, so although 
it was then dark, I found out how to 
reach friends there, who brought me 
home. 


HE President of Fisk University 

and I were traveling with a quar- 
tet to raise money for the Institution. 
It was during the holidays. We were 
making the leading cities in Oklahoma, 
Texas and Louisiana. In order to 
make a heavy schedule, we were taking 
late trains and transferring to our next 
point over night. The members of 
the quartet had been riding the day 
coach at night. The weather was crisp 
and the men had contracted colds. 


In transferring from Houston to 
New Orleans, we decided to secure 
Pullman accommodations and take the 
risk. . It was inter-state traffic and the 
written law was in our favor. We 
purchased two sections. The Presi- 
dent and I were to ride in the uppers 
and the members of the quartet in the 
lowers. Our great desire was to pro- 
tect the health of the young men and 
as a consequence guarantee good musi- 
cal programs for the audiences we 
were meeting. 


When we took our Pullman in 
Houston, we found the beds had not 
been “made down.” Hence, it became 
necessary for the members of the quar- 
tet to sit where they could be observed 
by the occupants of the car. To our 
regret, we discovered there was a very 
narrow, prejudiced, “fire-eating” per- 
son riding the car. When he discov- 
ered four young colored men on the 
car, “he went up in the air.” He 
gazed at them as if they were strange 
animals from some jungle. At once 
he began agitation among the passen- 
gers, trying to get the young men put 
out of the car. 

I went into the smoker and found 
the man “storming” over the situa- 
tion. He asked, “who brought those 
men on this train?” 

I replied, “The President of the 
University they represent and I are 
travelling with them in the interest of 
the college. They have been riding 
the open coaches at night until they are 
ill. Tonight we brought them on the 
Pullman to protect our programs.” 

He said, “Well, I do not know 
whom I think less of, the men for com- 
ing into the coach or the ones who 
brought them in here. There is a

We are constantly reproaching our- 
selves because the sheiks and the flap- 
pers—the serious and the simple, also 
—come out of college with no higher 
theatric appreciation than vaudeville, 
burlesque, and the cheaper movie 
houses. If they manifest any interest 
at all in other plays, it is usually the 
highly melodramatic or sexy portrayal 
of life. It is difficult for people to un- 
derstand that art is not instinctive; and 
that it is a result of training in appre- 
ciation. We appreciate any art in pro- 
portion to what we take to it. If we 
neglect this in college, how can we ex- 
pect students to come out and flock to 
the important productions? I have in- 
timated before that the only successful 
way to teach this appreciation is to sup- 
plement our study of theories with the 
actual experience such as gotten in a 
dramatic club. 

So a little more attention to this 
phase of work while in college will re- 
sult in a larger and larger audience for 
the better things in drama. 

By furnishing the agency for ob- 
jectively teaching drama and art; by 
aiding in cultural advertising and audi- 
ence building, college dramatics have a 
right to be considered more seriously 
by our colleges and the country in gen- 
eral, if they are at all interested in 
aesthetic development.
