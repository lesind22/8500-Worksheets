oo the proverbial Green Bay 
Tree, the SOUTHERN AID 
SOCIETY OF VA., INC., is 
spreading its branches over the 
state of New Jersey. Thriving 
districts and agencies have been 
established at Newark, Trenton, 
Camden, Paterson, the Oranges, 
Montclair, Atlantic City and 
Asbury Park. 





































Danville, Va., Bldg. 
212-14-16 N. Ridge St. 


The wide awake race citizens in these centers are giving 
this company a liberal share of their insurance patronage, 
| and thus are the recipients of the two-fold service which 
| this company offers its policyholders; namely, personal 
| protection when disabled by sickness or accident, and a 
| death claim after death, also dignified and profitable em- 
ployment to worthy race men and women, which means 
an elevation of race people in the economic scale of life. 




























Without this superior insurance contract which, for one 
small premium provides protection against disability and 
death, and which also makes it possible for worthy race 
boys and girls to have employment, your insurance needs 
have not been met.

Life on Cotton Plantation *O, God, Bring Back Our Zeke” 


HALLELUJAH 


King Vidor’s All Talking Picture 


Produced by 


METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER PICTURE CORPORATION 


THE STORY: 


Chick drifted into a life of sin, made efforts to climb out and lost, as women do sometimes. 


Zeke followed Chick into the depths, struggled to escape, committed murder, but finally won, 
returning home a chastened man. 


In this simple statement of the lives of two human beings is found the basis of the story, 
“Hallelujah.” Between the opening scene in a cotton field and the finale when Zeke returns to the 
cabin of his humble parents, there is a chapter in the life of the Negro people full of pathos, humor 


and thrills.

GREATEST NEGRO BUSINESS ENTERPRISE 


(pu 





ASULrance 
TO WORK | 


For MEL Me family 





OR nearly three hundred years our Race dwelt in an 
i organized civilization, in the midst of opportunity in 

which they could not share. All around them vast 
projects were being started; on all sides great developments 
were opening up; before their eyes the greatest commercial 
nation in the history of the world was in the making. But 
they had no part in all this. Their individual ambitions were 
blocked, through no fault of theirs. They were chattels, pieces 





of property, slaves. 

Today, the children of those racial forebears dwell in the same 
civilization but with a difference growing in emphasis with 
every passing year. 

There has been built up for them a broad range of opportu- 
nity. They are inheritors of a new tradition. They are free, 
with a freedom that is more than a legal technicality only, 
because within their own Race are available means for progress 
and for growth. 

The greatest of these means is the force of Insurance. The 
power of its insurance reserves has exerted an incalculable 





influence upon the progress of the Race—in the spread of edu- 
cation, in the growth of opportunity, in the fostering of thrift, 
in the accumulation of property assets, in the increase of finan- 









cial protection for the widow and the orphan, in the general 
advance of living standards. 

The insured family is the successful family. And that success 
is apt to be in direct ratio with the degree to which the benefits 
of insurance are utilized. 





Apply those benefits to every member of the family. Put your 








children in a position to develop the opportunities which are 
surely opening for every Negro fitted to grasp them. 


Put Insurance to work for ALL the family. 


Let us tell you how best to do so. Write

ELL, the World War is over, 

or will be June 30, 1930. On 
that day the last Allied soldier will 
leave German soil. We started some- 
thing 16 years ago which is not fin- 
ished yet and won’t be even in 1930. 
—England holds many great colonies 
by encouraging national and religious 
jealousies and then presiding as benev- 
olent arbitrator. This may not ex- 
plain the murder of Jews by Arabs in 
Palestine but if it doesn’t, T. E. Law- 
rence could add illuminating details.— 
In the long run our Government is 
tender-hearted. Recently, surveying 
the over-taxed people, it handed back 
$6,235,690.42 to the poor, including 
the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the 
General Electric Company and a half 
million to Frank §S. Love. Rastus 
Jones, who is paying $150 a year on 
a $2,000 house, got no refund, we re- 
gret to state—White labor like dumb 
cattle has built up mob-law and 
lynching in the South—Now it can 
take a little of its own medicine 
at Gastonia—Out of every dollar 
in Federal Taxes, 82 cents goes for 
war: to enable West Point cadets 
to strut for thrilled movie audiences ; 
to build twenty-million dollar battle- 





i D+ 


As the Crow Flies 


ships which shoot firecrackers and 
rust; to intimidate West Indian “Nig- 
gers.”—With the other 18 cents, we 
build Post Offices, dig out rivers, con- 
duct courts and educate a few Ameri- 
cans. Suppose we had 50 cents!— 
The 56th meeting of the Council of 
the League of Nations and the 10th 
Annual Meeting of the Assembly is the 
greatest gathering in the world in im- 
portance; the United States is char- 
acteristically refusing to play but peep- 
ing around the corner, sucking its 
thumb.—And still barbarous, Bolshe- 
vic and irreligious Russia is showing 
a world sick to death of war how not 
to fight—Naval reduction, battleships, 
submarines, parity, cruisers, units of 
measurement and all that! Shucks 
and Poppycock! The way to reduce 
navies is to reduce!—Kid Chocolate 
has licked 154 opponents but the ref- 
erees will lick him yet. Honor in 
Sport is white——The tariff question is 
simple: is it criminal to buy goods? 
Is it more criminal to buy goods of 
foreigners? If we don’t buy goods of 


Tuomas J. CaLLtoway, Business Manager 


I —, 


For the November Crisis we 
have “The Negro in Law’, a 
letter from Countée Cullen, Mr. 
Pickens on the South and a sheaf 
of poems. Watch the Junior 
Crisis. O, yes, and Laura 
Wheeler Waring is scouring

cover. 


am emcee 


foreigners, how can we make them 
buy our goods? Will the Sugar- 
Daddy from Utah please answer by 
return mail ?—China is misunderstood. 
The United States is misunderstood. 
The reason for misunderstanding 
China is censorship of the press, says 
the New York Times. Why are we 
misunderstood ?—Virginia, that emi- 
nently progressive state, is still voting 
vigorously on the issues of 1861-65.— 
That path around the World that 
lured Magellan is still attracting Zep- 
pelins—What? Is the English popu- 
lation stationary? Then it can never 
be the Biggest Nation on earth like 
us. Birth control is legal there while 
here let the poor devils of diseased 
half-starved infants roll in so long as 
they count One.—Why shouldn’t ship- 
builders oppose Peace and advocate 
battleships? Why shouldn’t manufac- 
turers oppose cheap foreign goods? 
Are we in business for our health ?— 
The bursting of the Wall Street specu- 
lation bubble seems about due.—The 
only thing that will make a United 
States of Europe is the abolition of 
tariffs.—The only thing that will make 
a federation of the world is the free- 
dom of the seas.

ABINDRANATH TAGORE 


was born in 1861 and educated 


privately. From the age of 24 to 40 
he had charge of his father’s estate and 
did much of his writing. At the age 
of 40, he founded a school at Santi- 
Niketan, Bengal, which developed into 
an international institution and has 
been his life’s work. He has visited 
Europe several times and also Asia and 
North and South America. He re- 
ceived the Nobel Prize for Literature 
in 1913. He has published about thir- 
ty poetical works and numerous books, 
essays and dramas. He has also set to 
music over three thousand songs. In 
1915, he was created a Knight by the 
Engilsh Government, but after the 
massacre of Amritsar, he refused the 
designation. 





Some time ago through the good of- 
fices of Mr. C. F. Andrews, the Edi-

July 12th, 1929 
Dear Sir: 

Dr. Tagore has just returned from 
Canada to Santiniketan where he finds 
your letter awaiting him. He is ex- 
tremely sorry that he could not send 
you a message earlier, but he hopes that 
the few lines which he offers to you 
now may still be some use to you and 
your friends. 


October, 1929 


The writing I may add is in the 
Poet’s own hand. 
With regards, 
Yours truly, 


Amiya C. CHAKRAVARTZ 
(Private Secretary to 


Dr. R. N. Tagore) 


The Message, which is reproduced 
in Mr. Tagore’s handwriting on this 
page, is as follows: 

“What is the great fact of this age? 
It is that the Messenger has knocked at 
our gate and all the bars have given way. 
Our doors have burst open. The human

races have come out of their enclosures. 
They have gathered together. 


“We have been engaged in cultivating 
each his own individual life, and within 
the forced seclusion of our racial tradi- 
tion. We had neither the wisdom nor 
the opportunity to harmonize our growth 
with world tendencies. But there are no 
longer walls to hide us. We have at 
length to prove our worth to the whole 
world, not merely to admiring groups of 
our own people. We must justify our 
own existence. We must show, each in 
our own civilization, that which is uni- 
versal in the heart of the unique.

Many of our readers will peruse 
these words with a certain puzzle- 
ment. Here is a man who is colored, 
who writes with practically nothing of 
what we are learning to call ‘“‘race con- 
sciousness.” His Message is universal. 
He has risen to something quite above 
the artificial limitations of race, color 
and nation. He recognizes the Mes- 
senger of Human Culture as bursting 
racial bonds. He sees racial and na- 
tional development as __ hindrances 
rather than helps to universal culture. 
We are all of us black, red, white or 
yellow. Out under the blazing sun 
of world news and knowledge, our 
great duty is to prove our worth to 
the world and not merely to ourselves. 
White civilization and white people 
must justify their worth to the world. 
Black people and yellow people must 
do the same. There is no question of 
domination, of rule, of superiority and 
inferiority. The Universal which in 
the heart of the Individual must show 
itself in every civilization. 


This is Tagore’s message in a lan- 


guage which neither white or black 
Americans can easily understand. 
White America is provincial and ma- 
terial to the last degree. To its little 
narrow mind nothing in earth, sky 
or sea is as big and rich and efficient 
as America. But we who criticize 
white America, have also by our very 
criticism been forced into provincial- 
ism. We are narrow by our own 
grievances and hates. This is natural, 
and today perhaps and in this genera- 
tion, almost inescapable. 

Even Tagore himself when he came 
to America found his environment so 
narrow and discourteous that he can- 
celled his engagements and went home. 
He said in Tokio, June 16th, that he 
had cancelled his tour of American 
universities because he was oppressed 
by the air of suspicion and incivility 
toward Asiatics. . 

“T had promised many people in the 
United States to come there. 

“T came to the United States. The 
immigration officials asked me to come 
into the office to present my documents. 
I entered the office and waited a half- 


su growth, oh sold branes, 


Bit Hw cre

hour. I could hear the official talking 
and laughing’ with a lady in the next 
room. He came to the door, saw me 
waiting and saw another gentleman. He 
talked to him for some time. 


“Then he beckoned me into his office, 
without a word, a nod or any sort of 
civility. He pointed to a chair and be- 
gan to question me. Did I know the 
restrictions of time within which [| 
could remain in the country? How long 
did I expect to remain? Was I pre- 
pared to deposit the required amount as 
guarantee that I would leave? Did | 
know the penalties for staying longer? 


“His insulting questions and attitude 
were deeply humiliating. I was not used 
to such treatment. I had been univer- 
sally and most cordially welcomed in 


Europe. Never had I had such an ex- 
perience. Perhaps it is due to new reg- 
ulations. Certainly it was an attitude 


I had never encountered. I hesitated 
about entering the country at all, but 
I had my tickets, had taken leave of my 
friends and had no desire to cause a 
row. 


“I came into the country, but my 
mind was not at ease. I went to Los 
Angeles, stayed there and lectured. But 
all the time I was impressed by the 
spirit in the air. The people seemed 
cultivating an attitude of suspicion and 
incivility toward Asiatics. I did not at 
all like it. I could not stay on suffer- 
ance, suffer indignities for being an 
Asiatic. It was not a personal griev- 
ance, but as a representative of all Asi- 
atic peoples I could not remain under 
the shadow of such an insult. I took 
passage without delay. 


“T have many friends in America, gen- 
uine idealists for whom I have the high- 
est regard. I have read books by their 
great men which have attracted my 
heart. I hope they have a great future 
in carrying on the mission of civilization 
as it has been begun in the West. I have 
real respect for the people, but also re- 
spect for my own people, ‘colored’ peo- 
ple. If they must meet such treatment 
in that country it is best for any self- 
respecting Asiatic not to thrust himself 
upon its hospitality. 

“T was silent when reporters came to 
me in Los Angeles. I wanted to go away 
quietly and not create a sensation. I 
am not used to airing my grievances, it 
is undignified. But I had an American 
companion, who felt the insult more 
keenly than I. He reviled the officer, 
using strong and picturesque American 
expressions which I had never heard be- 
fore. Otherwise, it would never have 
come out. 


“Let me emphasize once more that I 
bear no antipathy to the American peo- 
ple. I have been received with kindness 
in the Eastern States, overrun with 
kindness. People have listened to me 
with respect and received my message 
sincerely. ‘That is why it has hurt so 


much this time. Why does such a coun- 
try treat the peoples of Asia, colored 
peoples, all strangers who come within 
her gates with open minds, in such a 
manner that they get such an impression 
as I received?”

FOREWORD 


(Which presents the setting, the char- 
acters, and the argument) 


HE room you are in is mixed. 
It is mixed. 

There are ragged chairs with sorry 
sagging ragged bottoms.—There are 
lace curtains with sorry ragged holes— 
but all over the chairs are scattered 
clothes, mostly lingerie of the cream- 
jest, laciest, richest, pastel-crepe vari- 
ety. 

Everything is mixed. . 

Dishes are pushed back on the table. 
They may be yesterday’s dishes or they 
may be today’s. But dishes are pushed 
back and the table cloth is rumpled 
back. A pair of red kid pumps are 
on the edge of the table. Your eyes 
skip from the scarlet omen of their 
owner’s hasty death—omen, if the bot- 
tom still holds in superstition— 

Shoes mixed with dishes on the table. 

Newspapers, pillows, shoes and 
stockings are scattered across the floor, 
making a path straight to an exquisite 
dressing-table of the variety type. This 
stands at the extreme right of the stage. 

There is a window at right back— 
nearly at the centre—through which 
you see snow falling. Directly beside 
the window there is a door which must 
lead into an inner hall. It is not stout 
enough to be an outer door. It is the 
brownish sort of non-de-script door that 
shuts a cheap flat off from the rest of 
the world. 

On the left side of the room is an 
open couch-bed. The sheets and 
blankets depend almost to the floor in 
uneven jags. Easily, then, you can 
see the figure of a woman lying there. 
Her hair which is a light brown—lies 
with a thick waving around her head. 
Her face—thin—is almost as pale as 
the sheets. She is sleeping with an arm 
hung over the side of the bed. Even 
though she keeps tossing and twitching 
as if she would come awake, she holds 
her arm over the side. 

Down on the floor on the same side, 
lying so that her arm falls across him— 
there is a man. A part of his face 
shows against the bed-clothes and you 
can see he is blackly brown with the 
thin high-poised features that mark a 
“keen black man.” 

You can see at a glance that his slen- 
der body is caste for high things. High 
things. High things of the soul if the 
soul is fully living—high things of the 
flesh if the soul is fully dead. 

He is Buddy. 

The girl is Dot.

You are in their flat. 

They are most assuredly not brother 
and sister. 

Neither are they man and wife. 

The room is mixed. 

—Dot suddenly leans over the side 
toward Buddy. You wonder how she 
awakens so easily. 





Dot—‘‘Well Buddy I got a date. I 
got to get gone. Buddy! Buddy! 
(She leans over further and shakes 
him.) 

Buppy—‘‘Hunh—hunh? What say, 
Dot?” (He wakes up). ‘What say 
Dot?” (He yawns). “Uh-uh! Guess 
I was sleep. What say?” 

Dot—“I say I got a date, Buddy.” 

Buppy (fully awake at once)— 
“Date? Where you think you're 
going keeping a date sick as a dog 
and with the snow on the ground! 
(He looks toward the window.) 
Snowing now! Where you think 
you're going?” 

Dot—“I got a date I tell you!” 

Buppy—‘“An’ I tell you you ain’t go- 
going to keep it!” 

Dot—‘‘Aw cut that stuff! How long 
since you thought you could tell me 
when to go and when to come! Store 
that stuff!” 

Buppy—I ain’t storing nothing! You 
ain’t going, I say.” 

Dot—“Aw Buddy I been knowing the 
guy all my life! Played with him 
when I’s a kid! Been on parties 
with him since I been going around!” 

Buppy—‘“Aw don’t try that old friend 
stuff! What’s his name?” 

Dot—‘ Exit.” 

Buppy—“Exit? Exit! Where'd he 
get that! off the inside of a theayter 
door? Exit! Exit! What’s his 
other name or is that the onliest one 
he got?” 

Dot—“Mann. Exit Mann. That’s 
his name. Yeah—” (She hesitates 
and seems to be uncertain.) 

Buppy—“Well it sure is a rotten 
name! Must be hiding from the 
cops behind it!” 

(Dot takes this opportunity to rise 
from her couch. The filmy night 
garments cling to her almost as 
closely as her flesh. You see she is 
not curved. You see she is flat where 
she should curve, sunken where she 
should be flat. You wish she would 
lie down again but she gets up— 


almost falls back—takes hold of the 
back of the chair and passes across 
the room to the dressing table.) 

Buppy—“Look at you! ’Bout to fall 
down! You better lay down 
again.” (Dot has begun to brush her 
hair before the dressing table. She 
brushes rapidly with strokes that 
grow vigorous as if each one made 
some new strength start up in her.) 

Dot—‘Aw let me alone! I’m going 

out!” 
(Buddy sits on the floor and watches 
her. She rouges her cheeks and paints 
her lips and begins to powder heavily 
with white powder.) 

Buppy—‘You ain’t fixin’ to go out 
passing are you?” 

Dot—“Aw don’t ask so many fool 
questions!” 

Buppy (growing angry)—‘“‘Don’t get 
too smart! (Guess there’s something 
after all in what the fellers been 
saying "bout you anyhow.” 

Dot—‘What your nigger friends been 
saying now?” 

Buppy—“Nigger friends? You're a 
nigger yourself for all your white 
hide!” 

(shrugging) —‘‘I may not be— 
You’d never know!” 

Buppy—‘‘Aw shut up! You'd like to 
think ya was white! You'd have 
never lived with niggers if you'd a 
been all white and had a crack at a 
white man!” 

(Dot starts to speak—changes her 
mind—and paints her lips again.) 
Buppy (after a second’s silence)— 

“Take some of that stuff off!” 

Dot—“I can’t! Mann likes a wo- 
man like me to paint up so I’ll flash 
out above the crowd.” 

Buppy—“Mann! what’s Mann got to 
do with the way you look! Look 
here you! You been running ’round 
with this fellow Mann? (He 
plunges to his feet and lunges toward 
her.) Is he the white feller they 
been seeing you out with for the 
past three months?” 

Dot—“They? What 
more of your—!” 

Buppy—‘“Don’t call them niggers 
again you half-white—” 

(Dot catches him by the shoulder 
and pushes him away.—She selects a 
piece of clothes out of a drawer.) 

Dot—“I told you in the beginning I 
been knowing this guy all my life! 
Been out with him!” 

Buppy—“Is he white?” 

Dotr—“I don’t know!” 

Buppy—‘You don’t know! 
you meet him?” 


they? Some

Dot—‘“Aw for God sake shut up and 
let me alone! I never met him! 
This is the last time I’m going to 
tell you I been knowing him all my 
life!” 

Buppy—“Naw I ain’t lettin’ you 
alone! Naw I ain’t letting you 
alone! This is the guy the fellers 
been telling me about! This is the 
guy! Ol lop-sided lanky white 
thing! Been hanging around you 
at all the cafes and dances and on 
the streets all the time I’m out of 
the city! I’m out of the city— 
working to keep you—you hanging 
around with some no ’count white 
trash! So no count he got to come 
in nigger places, to nigger parties 
and then when he gets there—can’t 
even speak to none of them. Ain’t 
said a word to nobody the fellers 
say! Ain’t said a word! Just set- 
tin’ ’round—settin’ ’round—looking 
at you—hanging around you— 
dancin’ with you! He better not 
show hisself ’round here while I’m 
here!” 


Dot—“He can’t never come when 
you're here.” 


Buppy—“You right he can’t come 
here. Can’t never come! He bet- 
ter be afraid of me.” 


Dot—‘‘He ain’t afraid of you. He’s 
afraid of your love for me.” 

Buppy—(laughing shortly). “Aw for 
crap sake! My love! He ain’t 
afraid of my love! He’s afraid of 
my fist!” 

(Dot does not seem to hear him now. 
She talks to herself—It’s almost time! 
It’s almost time!’’) 

Buddy hears her the second she 
speaks—“Almost time for what?” 
Dot—‘“Him to come!” 
Buppy—“Who?” 

Dot—“Exit!” 

Buppy—(cursing). “He ain’t com- 
ing here! He ain’t coming here! 
I'll knock his head clean off his 
shoulders if he comes here!” 

Dot—‘He’s coming!” 

Buppy—‘T’ll kill you ’fore he gets 
here and then kill him when he 
comes!” 

Dot—“‘Aw Buddy—don’t take on so! 
If you love me he can’t come in be- 
tween your love and come to me!” 
* (Buddy curses until his veins are 
swollen—packed full of the poison 
of the curses.) 

Buppy—“Damn you! Damn you!! 
Trying to throw this ‘your love’ 
stuff out to cam’flage and hide be- 
hind. I tol’ you when we were 
fussing before you went to sleep 
that I didn’t believe you when you 
said everybody was lying on you! 
You said everybody was lying and 
you was tellin’ the truth! Say you 
ain’t never been with other men! 


336 


Naw I don’t love you!” 

(He breaks off and rushes to a 
drawer and snatches out a mean, 
ugly, blue-black, short, pistol.) 

Dot—(screaming and _ overturning 


her chair) “Aw Buddy—Buddy 
don’t! You love me!” 


Buppy—‘“Shut up!!” (He lifts the 
gun as if he were going to bring it 
down—raking her with fire the 
length of her body. He stops—) 
“Naw I don’t love you! Half- 
white rat!” 

Dot—(crawling to her knees away 
from him) “Then he’s got to 
come! I got to go with him!” 

Buppy—“Yas he’s got to come! And 
when he comes I'll fix you both! 
Get up!” (He prods her with his 
foot.) Get up! Get up and dress 
to go out before your Exit is here! 
Exit! Exit! Ill Exit him when I 
get through with you!” 

(Dot completes her powdering then 
she suddenly reaches her hat down 
from a hook above the table. It is a 
smart black turban. It is black crepe 
and is wound and wound around. She 
snatches up a sealskin coat that has 
been lying on another chair and begins 
1o put it on.) 

Buppy—‘“‘You must be foolish! What 
you putting the coat on over the 
night-clothes for?” 

Dot—‘I ain’t got time to put no more 
on.” 

Buppy—“Aw yes you got time, sis- 
ter! Put on all you want! I ain’t 
going to run you off before he gets 
here! You ain’t going ’till your 
Exit comes!” 

Dot—‘This is all I need—all I need! 
I’m ready.” 

Buppy—‘“You’re ready—where’s your 
friend? Can’t go without him!” 
Dot—‘“‘He’s here! (she points.) 

“There he is.” (And close behind 
Buddy you see a man standing. He 
is half in the shadow. All you can 
see is a dark over-coat, a dark felt 
hat. You cannot see his face for 
his back is turned. You wonder 
how he came there. You wonder if 
perhaps he has not been there all 
the while.) 

Buppy—(starting back as he sees the 
man.) “You're a regular sneak, 
ain’t you! Ain’t enough to sneak in 
and take a man’s girl while he’s out 
workin! Got to sneak in his house! 
Sneak in on him when he’s minding 
his business!” 

(The man does not move or answer. 
Dot’s color is bright. Her eyes glow 
in the semi-shadow. The lights in the 
room seem dimmer somehow. Dot is 
breathing so that the fur mounts and 
slides—mounts and slides on her 
bosom. She keeps wetting her lips as 
if they were drying out. She starts 








across the floor toward him but pauses 

and draws back almost at once.) 

Buppy—(still talking to the man.) 
“Turn around and say something! 
Turn around and say something! 
They say all you do is hang around 
niggers’ places and keep a. still 
tongue!” (Jo Dot) ‘Go on over! 
Go on up to your Exit. Go on so 
you can go off the way I am sending 
you off. Go off like you lived! Ly- 
ing in some man’s arms—then ly- 
ing to me (as if to himself )—That's 
the way to die anyhow: jus’ like you 
lived!” 

Dot—(rubbing a hand across her 
face.) “Buddy!” (gasping) ‘Bud- 
dy! Say you love me! I don’t 
want to go! I don’t want to go 
with him!” 

(Buddy’s answer is an inarticulate 
wild roar:—“Get on to him! Get on 
ever to him!’’) 

(With a scream and a quick run 
Dot crosses the little space and as 
quickly the man opens his arms and 
draws her to him without turning 
around.) 

Dot—(crying smothered against the 
coat as if she were far away) 
‘“‘Buddy—Buddy—Buddy! Do you 
love me? Say you love me before 
I go!” 

(As she cries out the man begins to 
walk toward the back door. Buddy 
curses and fires at the same time. A 
stray shot strikes the light. It goes 
out. Buddy scratches a match and 
you see the man standing in the door- 
way—about to cross the threshold. 
His back is still turned but as you look 
he slowly begins to turn around.) 
Buppy—“Mann? Mann!! Dot! Dot! 

(At that the man turns fully and 
you see Dot laid limp—hung limp— 
silent. Above her, showing in the 
match light between the overcoat and 
the felt hat are the hollow eyes and 
fleshless cheeks of Death. 

But almost at once the light flares 
back. You see the room as it was at 
first. Dot on her couch with her 
arms hanging over the side—Buddy 
lying beside the couch. The red shoes 
on the table.) 

Dot—(struggling awake)—“Buddy! 
(You can hear a rattling in her 
throat. A loud rattling. The rat- 
tling of breath soon to cease). 
“Buddy!!! Buddy!! Aw God, he 
can’t hear me!—Buddy, do you love 
me? Say you love me ’fore I go! 
Ah—ah—ah—!” (The rattling is 
loud—loud. It stops on a high note. 
She stretches rigid and is still.) 
(The room is quiet an instant. You 

think you hear the rattling, though.) 

Buppy—(striving in his _ sleep) 
“Exit!! Mann!! Exit! (He pauses

EVEREND LAURENCE FEN- 

NINGER, for fifteen years chap- 
lain at Hampton Institute, has sent in 
his resignation to take effect Septem- 
ber 1. Thus there is taken away from 
the Hampton campus the central fig- 
ure of that little band of workers who 
in-season and out of season have held 
to their ideal of a fair, full, and un- 
wavering brotherliness in their human 
relationships—that “righteous minor- 
ity” which has rejected any notion of 
racial superiority, that has held in con- 
tempt the subtle hypocrisies which here 
and there have come to the fore, incon- 
grouous to the ideals of the founder of 
the school, the late Samuel Chapman 
Armstrong, and directly opposed to the 
Christian teachings fostered by Hamp- 
ton. 

Under two administrations—F rissell 
and Gregg—Mr. Fenninger has been 
teacher, friend, companion, co-worker, 
and example to thousands of Negro 
young men and women who gathered 
year after year to pursue an education, 
and through his contacts with other 
groups—ministers, teachers, farmers, 
and back-wood congregations,—he has 
been a great force in making Chris- 
tianity a positive, living thing in the 
lives of his fellows. Whenever he 
spoke he had something to say, and be- 
hind all that he uttered was a life that 
could be held before the light of closest 
scrutiny. He was sincere, unafraid, 
yet calm and discreet. His atitude in 
the field of race relations was consist- 
ent. He put his Christian understand- 
ing of the brotherhood of man and the 
fatherhood of God above all considera- 
tions. He started and developed the 
Hampton Ministers’ Conference, which 
every year brings together nearly 500 
ministers of all denominations, to 
study, confer, and live together; in this 
way he has come in actual contact with 


Laurence Fenninger, Friend 


By G. JAMES FLEMING 


about 3300 of the church leaders 
among colored folk in various parts of 
the country. He injected new vigor 
and meaning into religious teaching at 
Hampton. He converted the Y. M. C. 
A. into more than a praise-singing or- 
ganization and utilized it for clearing 
the tortuous paths of misunderstanding, 
for making more real the oneness of all 
humanity. Speakers that the. school 
proper avoided for one reason or an- 
other could always find a free atmos- 
phere around the cabinet table or in the 
assembly rooms of Clark Hall. 

Mr. Fenninger opposed sham where- 
ever he found it and exposed false no- 
tions, in so far as he was able. He and 
his family willingly accepted social os- 
tracism at the hands of the majority of 
the white workers and the white towns- 
people, but they were never bitter, 
never ruffled. He often championed 
the cause of the students, not because 
they were members of the Negro race, 
but because his sense of right and 
wrong compelled him to do so. When- 
ever students went astray, individually 
or collectively, he was just as out- 
spoken in censuring them as in de- 
fending them. But, after he had given 
voice to his opinions, he still maintained 
the love and respect of the student 
body, and he, in turn, still remained 
friendly to them. 

At a period when the slogan was 
“let us do all we can to gain the favor 
of our good Southern friends,’ Mr. 
Fenninger continued to follow the light 
as he saw it. He would not barter his 
soul for an invitation to afternoon teas 
or “egg-nog parties;’ he would not 
establish a dual personality, one for his 
Negro friends and another acceptable 
to the Rotarians and Kiwanians; he 
turned his back on every suggestion to 
sell his higher, internal happiness for 
a place on the social register. And 


right here one must pause to make 
mention of Mrs. Natalie Fenninger, 
his wife, for she, too, has been willing 
to stand unflinchingly for the right as 
her Christianity revealed that right to 
her. Her four children are the finest 
examples of her full Christian char- 
acter. They, like their parents, and in 
their youthful ways, give evidence of 
that kind of nature which sees through 
the surface and discovers the genuine 
qualities hidden below—qualities which 
are deeper and more fundamental than 
color, race, or social standing. 

The attitude of the Fenninger house- 
hold is not that of paternalism, but 
that of fraternalism, of human equal- 
ity before God. So consistently and 
sincerely have they given over them- 
selves to this attitude that it is very 
usual to hear people of color around 
Hampton make expressions like these: 

“When I visit at the Fenninger’s I 
feel as if I am in my own home.” 

‘They are square; when I speak or 
think of them I entirely forget the mat- 
ter of the difference of color or race.” 

“For Negroes who are suspicious and 
distrustful of all white people, contact 
with the Fenningers is a new revela- 
tion.” 

On many occasions when young 
people in the school have been broken 
by some sorrow, like a death in the 
family, they have passed over even the 
homes of colored families and set out 
for Mrs. Fenninger to seek a few com- 
forting words. And for these and 
other favors, students have felt free to 
go at anytime—morning, noon, or mid- 
night. They went to the home of 
friends—friends tried and found not 
wanting. 

Yet, these people are not sinfully 
kind, they are not fanatical, they are 
not disagreeable. They refuse to ac-

The Work of the N. A. A. C. P. 


By DR. MORDECAI W. JOHNSON 


T gives me very great joy to have 

the privilege of being present on 
this Twentieth Anniversary occasion 
of the National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People which 
began as one of many movements work- 
ing to secure the emancipation of the 
colored people and which, during these 
twenty years, has emerged unquestion- 
ably into leadership of all these organi- 
zations by reason of the work which 
it has done, the worth of which is no 
longer now doubted by any thoughtful 
American citizen. And not only by 
reason of the results of the work which 
it has done, which are manifest in this 
and that particular thing, which no 
no doubt have been summarized many 
times during this Convention, but it 
has emerged by reason of the charac- 
ter of the organization’s personnel and 
procedure; and the great thing we have 
to rejoice over today, it seems to me, 
is primarily that after twenty years 
there does now exist in the United 
States a movement which has come 
through all the fires of battle and criti- 
cism and suffering, confident in its own 
ability to do the great work which it 
has before it and freely approved of by 
the best citizens of our country as the 
most hopeful organization to be de- 
pended upon to do that work within 
the confines of our country. 








Dr. Johnson is the first colored 
President of Howard University 
and Fifteenth Spingarn Medalist. 
The following address was deliver- 
ed at the 20th annual conference 


of the N. A. A. C. P. at Cleveland, 
Ohio, before 6,000 auditors. 





A people who have suffered as deep- 
ly as we have suffered during the last 
sixty years were in many dangers. One 
of these dangers was that we should 
produce and continue a mass move- 
ment of protest with loud-voiced and 
blind groping, ineffectual and leading 
eventually to violence. It is one thing 
to be moved with a deep and powerful 
sense of wrong and with all the indig- 
nation and bitterness which grow out 
of that suffering. It is another thing 
to be able to direct that indigation into 
intelligent and non-violent channels, 
peaceful, but properly protected behind 
a constructive program and sticking to 
it with all power over a period of years. 
The National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People has 
saved us from being a blind and grop- 
ing mass of ineffectual speech-making 
and indignation. It has clarified the 
objectives which we should have before 
us, and in clarifying our objectives it 


has enabled us to concentrate our ener- 
gies upon major, tap-root, trunk line 
fundamental procedure. It has saved 
us from ineffectual radicalism and vio- 
lence by drawing our attention to the 
fact that the very foundations of the 
American Republic, in law and intent, 
are with our hopes and that what we 
need to do is not to make any endeavor 
to over-turn the American Constitu- 
tion or even to establish a new body 
of law, but to exercise powerful and 
peaceful persuasion to the end that the 
basic law of the country and the intent 
of the fathers, which is already with 
us, shall be done as a matter of fact. 
But it has done more than that. It 
has given us an approach to the Ameri- 
can people, charged with a fundamental 
faith in the latent gentleness even of 
those who harm us. Nothing has been 
more characteristic of the National As- 
sociation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People than the confidence with 
which it has addressed itself to men 
and women on the question of enmity 
and violence toward the Negro people. 
They have inspired us with a confidence 
that under all circumstances men could 
be depended upon to take the clear al- 
ternative of being just or being unjust 
or openly cruel. And one of the most

beautiful things apparent to me in the 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People today is the 
persuasiveness which it has exercised 
over the latent courtesy and gentleness 
in the Southern white man, for among 
‘the supporters of the National Associa- 
tion today are not only militant black 
men and white men, sons of Abolition- 
ists, but Southern gentlemen who, hav- 
ing been faced with the unequivocal 
alternative between truth and lying, be- 
tween honor and dishonor, between 
open violence and human justice, have 
not been able to resist taking the side 
of right and showing to America they 
had the stuff in them to make a great 
country. 


And yet, again, one of the most 
hopeful things about this organization 
is that while in its intent toward the 
American people it is as non-violent 
and harmless as a dove, it has deliber- 
ately and painstakingly acquainted it- 
self with all the realistic approaches to 
public evil which are capable of mak- 
ing ideals effective in such a world as 
this. One of the dangers of every pro- 
test movement is that it will use ab- 
stract language; that it will not put its 
feet on the ground and walk realistical- 
ly. The National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People has 
mastered the weapon of propaganda 
and legal approach. It has mastered 
other weapons, the weapons of respect 
of powerful minds, which constitute the 
most able and effectual means of get- 
ting our will done that can be achieved 
on the assumption that we are living 
in an honest country. But all of these 
things have been said to you before I 
have spoken, and said much better than 
I have said them, because what I have 
said does not constitute the funda- 
mental part of the original intent of my 
speech, 

THREE FEARS 

One of the great temptations of 
every suffering minority is to be ab- 
sorbed in its suffering, and thereby to 
discover the power of its own protest 
energies. And one of the great dan- 
gers confronting the American Negro 
is the danger of believing that he is liv- 
ing in a country in which it is all well 
with all of the people except himself, 
and that he is free, therefore, to center 
all of his energies upon and to direct 
all his endeavors to getting his whole 
rights. It is good for us, even in the 
presence of an organization of this 
kind, to remember that we live in a 
country in which the most thoughtful 
white men today are deeply troubled 
at the incoming President of the 
United States startling the American 
people by laying before them at the 
very outset of his administration, in 
the most prosperous period of the na- 


October, 1929 





tion’s history, his grievous and deep- 
growing trouble about the prevalence 
of lawlessness in this country—wide- 
spread disregard for the law. One of 
the very first acts of his administration 
was to appoint a commission of able 
citizens to study the sources and pos- 
sible cure of the widespread lawlessness 
prevailing in our country today. 
‘Thoughtful men everywhere are deep- 
ly troubled about deliberate disobedi- 
ence of the law in America. But 
thoughtful men in America also today 
are deeply troubled and even filled with 
fear lest the two leading English- 
speaking nations of the world, of which 
we are one, may come to war with one 
another. Whatever attempt be made 
by the press to dispel this fear, every 
sensible man who listens to the con- 
versation of the American people 
knows that this is true; and the trem- 
bling enthusiasm with which we 
American people are now getting 
ready to receive a visit from the Prime 
Minister of England grows out of the 
secret and eager hope that somehow 
what seems to be an inevitable clash 
between the two greatest powers of 
the Western world may be avoided by 
conference between the two great ex- 
ecutives; for we have a feeling that if 
these two great peoples misunderstand 
one another there will ensue at length 
a conflagration involving all the civil- 
ized world and which may at this time 
break the very backbone of Western 
civilization. 

But there is a third fear also, if you 
consult thoughtful men in America to- 
day. They are very much disturbed 
about the state of American religion. 
A few years ago we had a conflict be- 
tween the fundamentalists and mod- 
ernists. It appears from the news- 
papers that that conflict has died down, 
but it is only an appearance. Every 
thoughtful man in America knows that 
deep down beneath our traditional re- 
ligious beliefs, which we have inherited 
from a past of two thousand years, 
there is a continuous and progressive 
loss of power over the public mind 
manifest in its relation to religion every 
day. 


We live in a country, therefore, 
which is troubled about the three great 
fundamental things about which no na- 
tion may be troubled and sleep peace- 
fully. National disorder threatened by 
the progressive growth of violation of 
the law. International difficulties 
growing out of misunderstanding be- 
tween the two leading peoples of the 
world both of whom speak the English 
language, both of whom profess the 
same religion and who stand in histori- 
cal relation to one another as mother 
and son. Deep-seated trouble about 
the failure of religion to battle success- 


fully with the modern mind. I sup- 
pose that the thoughtful leaders of this 
nation would do anything in their 
power to discover the tap-root causes 
of these great social diseases sweeping 
down upon us and to be able success- 
fully to attack them and dislodge them 
from the public order. It would be in- 
structive to the American people at 
large to study the causes of these things 
at that point in our social order upon 
which the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People has 
fixed its attention. It is quite possible 
that the Commission of learned law- 
yers and educators may not learn in a 
year as much about the root causes of 
disobedience to law in committee meet- 
ings as they could learn in an hour if 
they knew what the suffering black 
man knows about law violation in 
America; for the most direct and sure 
diagnosis of any social trouble can be 
had not by the disinterested and ob- 
jective reflections of men removed at a 
distance but by giving immediate at- 
tention to those who suffer most deep- 
ly from the wrong which it is hoped to 
get rid of. 


Lawlessness 


There is an opinion in America that 
the great cause of law violation is in 
the multitude of petty criminal acti- 
vities which have in some way been 
able to overcome the honest, able and 
well intentioned officers of the law. 
Every black man knows that that is 
not true. Every black man in Ameri- 
ca knows that the tap root of disobedi- 
ence to law in America lies in the law- 
less interpretation and execution of the 
law by the public agents of the law 
themselves who deliberately and skiil- 
fully twist the meaning of the law and 
the Constitution away from its original 
intent in order to sustain the interests 
of dominant numbers of people. We 
know that we have not suffered most 
from criminals. We have suffered 
most from the ministrations and activi- 
ties of men clothed with the dignity of 
the law but who, in the presence of our 
need for protection, have interpreted 
the law out of its original moral in- 
tent and have done violence to our in- 
terests for the sake of serving the spe- 
cial interests of their own group. There 
exists in America today a page of legal 
decisions participated in by judges of 
courts, from the lowest municipal 
court to that Supreme Court which sits 
at the heart of the nation, in which 
every thoughtful American knows the 
fundamental law of America has been 
skillfully and deliberately twisted out 
of its original meaning. For sixty-five 
years the lawyers and judges and legis- 
lators of America have deliberately per- 
petrated, in the presence of their chil- 
dren and all mankind the misinterpre- 
tation of the intent of the law know-

ingly, keeping within the letter of the 
law, in order to maintain a status quo 
agreed upon in advance, and in violence 
to the ‘fundamental rights of the 
American Negro. This is the gravest 
crime that.can be committed against 
the law, for it deprives the law and 
the law-giver of that last barrier that 
stands between the criminal and suc- 
cess, namely, the conviction of the peo- 
ple that the legislator and the judge 
embody in their presence the original 
moral intent of the fundamental law. 
This has been practiced so long that 
we have trained two generations of 
lawyers to put their emphasis not upon 
powerful, just, wholesome, straight- 
forward and truthful interpretation of 
the law but upon skillful juggling with 
the words of the law so as to make it 
safe to excuse the violation of the in- 
tent of the law. And they have learned 
it well. The same fundamental proc- 
ess which made it hard for the black 
man to get justice in the Circuit Court 
of Greenville, Mississippi, has made 
it hard for the American people to 
convict a mammoth criminal who 
openly violates every instinct of Ameri- 
can law and gets off with a petty sen- 
tence of three months in a police jail; 
and that, too, not for the violation of 
the law, of which every American 
knows he is guilty, but because his law- 
yer made the technical mistake of ad- 
vising him not to testify before a Sen- 
ate committee. We have taught the 
powerful that the law will be subject 
to misinterpretation and the powerful 
have taken advantage of the lesson we 
have taught them. 


War 


The American people would be in- 
formed by giving attention to what a 
man says he suffers. Under the last 
administration of our great, silent, 
economical President, we negotiated a 
treaty with all the European powers 
and thus solemnly agreed that we 


October, 1929 





would no longer use war as a weapon 
of international advantage. Many of 
the great American papers have praised 
this document to the highest, and they 
may well do so, because as a psychologi- 
cal measure it constitutes one of the 
finest addresses made to the conscience 
of the people of the world in modern 
times. But the American people have 
been addressed by the Constitution, 
which is also a fine document, for many 
years. They have been addressed also 
by the Declaration of Independence 
and occasionally believe what it says. 
But they know that in the last analysis, 
what we have to deal with in this 
world is not a battle between skillful 
documents but issues between realities 
in the minds of living people, and the 





“My daughter”, drawn by W. E. Luckett. 


American people, in spite of all they 
say, do not believe and cannot believe 
the Kellogg Treaty is going to keep us 


out of war; and not a single Negro 
with any sense in America could be- 
lieve it if he wanted to. But the 
Negro knows by what he has suffered 
what it is that causes war in the world. 
He knows that war is caused not pri- 
marily by the capability of an eloquent 
statesman to put the right verb or the 
right adjective in a great document; he 
knows it does not depend primarily up- 
on a successful conference between ex- 
ecutives. He knows from what he has 
suffered and the awful feelings that 
have arisen from his suffering, that the 
thing which produces war is the re- 
sentment of peoples against violence 
done to them; and he knows that war 
will never cease until violence to hu- 
man beings ceases in the world. There 
is no kind of paper agreement which 
white men in the Western World can 
execute between one another that will 
make them trust one another, and they 
know it. For there is not a single great 
nation in the Western World which 
does not know that it is a perpetrator 
of violence, filled with perpetrators of 
violence, and perpetrators of violence 
cannot fundamentally trust one an- 
other. 

A most illuminating thing happened 
in the administration of President Wil- 
son. There came to the Attorney- 
Generalship of this country a Chris- 
tian gentleman by the name of Palmer 
who, while we were engaged in a most 
awful war, suddenly got terribly ex- 
cited one night over the thought that 
the Bolsheviks of Russia had organized 
violence among American Negroes; 
and he believed that so strongly that 
he actually took fundamental measures 
to protect the common good against 
the violence of Negroes. There is

NE may easily trace the rise of the 

American Negro inthe drama 
—remembering only that the stage 
records something long accomplished 
and not history in the actual mak- 
ing. Centuries ago the English 
drama in Othello and Oronooko por- 
trayed the sorrows of great black 
men nobly born and fallen on misfor- 
tune. Then with slavery came first 
pity then contempt in Uncle Tom and 
Jim Crow. Finally, with the “min- 
strels’” nadir was reached and the Ne- 
gro was so bizarre and degraded that 
only white men blacked up could pic- 
ture the depths which the Negro occu- 
pied in white men’s imagination. 


Out of this morass of public esteem

the Negro began to raise himself; first, 
by being really droll and funny like 
Billy Kersands; to this Cole and John- 
son and Bert Williams added rare 
cleverness, careful grooming and even 
the beginnings of beauty and romance. 
But the difficulties were tremendous. 
The public would brook no real note 
of pathos in Negroes and disliked even 
seriousness of any sort. Especially and 
curiously, they resented any real love- 
making between Negroes and no Ne- 
gro woman was permitted to play the 
part of heroine. 

The Negro drama lagged with the 
passing of the Great Funmakers—al- 
most died, then revived suddenly as 
squalor, poverty and dark tragedy. 
White playwrights began to see the 
Negro problem as utter frustration,

“All God’s Chillun” and ‘Emperor 
Jones” illustrated this phase but its 
thorough development was distorted by 
a skeptical white audience; they would 
not accept the tragedy of the Negro 
except in the Harlem cabaret, and 
they would not let whites and Negroes 
play together on the stage and thus por- 
tray racial contact. 

The genius and authority of Belasco 
broke the white-black complex in “Lulu 
Belle”, but left the sordid tragedy un- 
touched. “Porgy” softened the tragedy 
with faint nobleness of character. Then 
in the movies came “Hearts in Dixie” 
and “Hallelujah”. Both these por-

West Africa was especially well repre-

few I came in contact with and dis- 
cussed the color question with seemed

quency among colored children in Phil- 
adelphia is increasing. 

@ One of the youngest Masters of 
Arts of Columbia University, 1929, 
was Catherine I. Hewitt of Florence, 
Alabama. She did her college work at 
Fisk University in three years, grad- 
uating in 1928. 

@ G. L. Harrison, who received the 
degree of Master of Arts in Education, 
University of Cincinnati, 1929, is now

@ Ewart Gladstone Guinier of Rox- 
bury, Massachusetts, has within the 
past four months been the recipient of 
many prizes and scholarships at the 
Boston English High School. Guinier 
has been awarded a Price Greenleaf 
Scholarship at Harvard University; 
the Burroughs Newsboys’ Foundation 
of Boston has granted him one of its 
scholarships; the English High School 
has conferred on him the Cumston 
Award, which carries a stipend of over 
$200, the John Bouve Clapp Prize for 
excellence in English and the Washing- 
ton-Franklin medal for excellence in 
United States history. While at the 
high school, Guinier was editor-in- 
chief of the Record and vice-president 
of the Class of 1929. He is now a 
member of the Class of 1933 in Har- 
vard College.

MIDDLE WEST 

@ The University of the City of To- 
ledo had 32 Negro students in the year 
1929. Four of these received the 
Bachelors’ Degree. 

@ Andrew Steward a colored contrac- 
tor has purchased a home in Win- 
netka, a wealthy suburb of Chicago. 
There is opposition to his occupying it. 
@ The colored Shriners met in Chi- 
cago and re-elected C. R. Blake as Im- 
perial Potentate. It was announced 
that a second suit for injunction 
against the Order had been brought 
by the white Masons. 


SOUTH EAST 


@ Of 262,081 colored pupils in the 
North Carolina schools, 1927-28, 
178,727 were over age, or sixty-eight 
and two-tenths per cent. Forty-two 
and one-tenth per cent of the white 
children were over age. 

@ Charleston County, South Caro- 
lina, spent for each white pupil $99.22 
last year for education and for each 
colored pupil, $20.75. White male 
teachers received on an average of 
$2,089 a year and colored male teach- 
ers, $916. White women teachers, 
$1,173, and colored women, $569. 
There were 25 pupils to each white 
teacher and 40 to each colored teacher. 
@ Dr. Thomas W. Turner, head of 
the Department of Biology at Hamp- 
ton Institute, has sabbatical leave for 
one year to study in Europe. 

@ A new hospital for crippled chil- 
dren has been opened in Chattanooga 
costing $250,000. Twelve of the 100 


beds have been set aside for colored 
children and a colored nurse appointed 
to attend them. 

@ Sixty-five per cent of the organized 
workers in North Carolina are Ne- 
croes. Nevertheless, at the State Fed- 
eration of Labor Conference not a sin- 
gle Negro delegate was seated. 


@ Robert L. Pendleton, a printer in 
Washington, D. C., is dead. He was 
Sovereign Grand Commander of the 
33rd Degree Masons. 

@ John C. Wright, Assistant Direc- 
tor of the Academic Department of the 
Tuskegee Institute, has been elected 
President of Bricks Junior College, 
North Carolina, which is under the 
control of the American Missionary 
Association. Mr. Wright is a graduate 
of Oberlin and has taught at Tuske- 
gee, Tallahassee, Florida, and served 
overseas during the war as Y. M. C. 
A. Secretary. Afterward, he was Edu- 
cational Secretary at the Harlem 
Y. M. C. A., and was president of 
Edward Waters College, Jacksonville, 
for two years. 

@ A report from the Superintendent 
of Public Instruction of North Caro- 
lina shows that in the state the cost 
of educating a white pupil is $29.69 a 
year and of a colored pupil $11.84. 
There are 33 pupils to every white 
teacher and 44 to every colored teacher. 
The average salary of teachers and 
principals is $966 for the whites and 
$516 for the Negroes. Despite this 
evident discrimination, it must be re- 
membered that the situation in North 
Carolina is by far the best of any 
state in the South.

John L. Anderson, the preacher. 

@ The Council of Bishops of the A. 
M. E. Church held at Denver, Colo- 
rado in June took further steps on the 
question of the organic union of this 
church with the Zion Church and the 
colored Methodists. The annual con- 
ferences must now vote on the subject 


and a three-fourths majority is neces- 
sary. 

@ The Oakland, California, Coun- 
cil of Church Women had a luncheon 
August 23rd with official representa- 
tives of the Japanese, Chinese, and East 
Indians. A Spanish girl sang and a col- 
ored girl who has graduated from the 
University of California spoke on the 
work of the N. A. A. C. P. Miss 
Delilah L. Beasley arranged the inter- 
racial feature of the luncheon.

@ At Centerville, Tennessee, T. 
Wright was arrested for rape on a 


white woman. The woman and two 
relatives admitted on the stand that 
they had lied when they said that all 
three were present. —The woman herself 
maintained, however, that her othe; 
testimony was true. He was sentenced 
to ten years in the penitentiary. The 
case has been appealed. 

@ Two colored persons, E. O. David 
and Mrs. Frances Reem, were ap- 
pointed election registrars in the 29th 
Ward of Memphis. This is the first 
appointment of the kind since Recon- 
struction.

Three smaller parks are also about to 
be improved. Martin Park consists 
of a half acre. Douglas Park is four 
acres in size and was improved but was 
then ruined by the flood. Loveland 
Park, an acre in size, is near the high 
school. Harmon Park of 60 acres was 
purchased through a gift by the Har- 
mon Foundation. It is equipped as a 
community park. Dixie Park of 242 
acres was bought two years ago and 
has a swimming pool, community house 
and swings. Greenway Park, a strip 
of land North of the Masonic Temple, 
was purchased in 1927 for $15,662. 
WEST INDIES 
q At Kingston, Jamaica, the Univer- 
sal Negro Improvement Association 
met with many thousand delegates. 
Marcus Garvey was re-elected Presi- 
dent. 
@ Wilford Rankin, M.A., Ph.D., has 
returned to British Guiana. Mr. 
Rankin has studied in the United 
States, holding a scholarship at Colum- 
bia, and the universities in England 
and France. He received his degree 
of Doctor of Philosophy at the Uni- 
versity of Aberdeen, Scotland. 
@ In Granada, British West Indies, 
the Governor, Sir F. Seton James, has 
been in a hot controversy with the 
Honorable T. Albert Marryshow. 
Mr. Marryshow is a member of the 
Legislative Council and a colored man 
who is independent and fighting hard 
for the rights of colored West Indians. 


@ The white Haitien officeholders 
had a scheme of spending $6,200 to 
send President Borno on a barnstorm- 
ing expedition to the United States. 
This was to be an effort to avoid 
promised popular elections. It looks 
as though the United States Govern- 
ment was not going to permit this. 


@ A Negro Progress Conference was 
held in British Guiana, August Ist. 
The Reverend Floyd G. Snelson, an 
American, was one of the chief speak- 
ers. Eric Waldron was a visitor. 


NORTH AND EAST AFRICA 


@ The new treaty between Great 
Britain and Egypt which the Labor 
Ministry has proposed provides for the 
evacuation of Egypt by the British 
military forces, except a force to guard 
the Suez Canal; alliance between 
Great Britain and Egypt, and the ad- 
mission of Egypt to the League of Na- 
tions. Egypt is to have control of her 
own courts and the so-called capitula- 
tions are to be ended. 

@ The United Presbyterian School of 
Northern Khartoum is the best school 
in the Sudan for the education of 
native girls. There were this year 


October, 1929 








three graduates of the 8th Grade, 
which is a new record for the Sudan. 
The girls are: the Misses Tobia and 
Miss Yufuf. The teachers are all 
white American women, as the church 
refuses to employ colored Americans. 
There is also an Agricultural School 
five miles east of Khartoum which was 
opened in 1924. Here there were 
three young men as graduates. This 
is the only school of its kind in the 
whole Sudan and is named after the 
missionary, Dr. J. Kelly Giffen. 

@ The methods of some white mis- 
sionaries in Africa is illustrated by a 
case in Uganda. A cow there repre- 
sents the savings of a life time. Twelve 
peasants complain that they are com- 
pelled to take one cow to the English 
Church Missionary Society at a station 
three days’ march away each month, 
and to stay there for a month and fur- 
nish milk. They receive only 2 shil- 
lings for the milk thus supplied and no 
compensation if the cow dies. This 
milk is for private persons and not for 
a hospital. 





The Misses Tobia and Yusuf 


WEST AFRICA AND CONGO 


@ Africa is the coming copper coun- 
try of the world. It already stands 
fourth in the production of copper, 
having produced 124,000 tons in 1928. 
It has reserves at Katanga, Belgian 


Congo, of 86,000,000 tons. - 


@ Forty years ago Bishop Camille 
Van Ronsle went to the Belgian Congo 
as a missionary. At the age of 65 he 
resigned his position and the Roman 
See appointed Bishap Noel de Cleene. 
Today, at the age of 67, he returns 
to the Congo as a simple missionary 
to work under the Belgium Fathers of 
Scheut who have made over 80,000 
Catholic converts. 


@ The governments of Nigeria and 
the Gold Coast, British West Africa, 
will again take part in the Canadian 
National Exposition held in September 
this year. West Africa will occupy a 
thousand square feet in the Dominion 
Government Building. 


@ The School of Pharmacy at Lagos, 
Nigeria, British West Africa, has been 
in existence four years. J. J. Nicol 
is the first African instructor. There 
are over thirty students and nine col- 
ored instructors. 


@ The Ibadan Native Administra- 
tion, Nigeria, British West Africa, 
has built and equipped a hospital at 
Agodi at a cost of over $40,000; it is 
maintained entirely by the natives, and 
has 37 beds and an Out-patient De- 
partment. 

@ Salami Agbaje is an important cit- 
izen of Ibadan, which is a city of 200,- 
000 inhabitants. He owns a palatial 
home on three acres of land and is a 
trader and merchant with 400 em- 
ployees. He has done a great deal to 
clean up the city and encourage social 
development. 


@ The Gold Coast British West Af- 
rica is spending this year nearly a mil- 
lion and a half dollars for education, 
a larger sum than any British colony, 
except the Malay states. 


@ Alcoholic spirits were imported 
into the British African colonies as 
follows: in 1920, 662,640 gallons; in 
1928, 1,974,865 gallons. 


SOUTH AFRICA 


@ The general election in South Af- 
rica has resulted in the return of Hert- 
zog and the National Party for five 
years. They have a small but sufh- 
cient majority over all the other 
parties. The Labor Party has been 
decisively defeated. 

The issue was won on the Native 
Bills’ question and the struggle for 
segregation and economic enslavement 
of the natives will continue. With 
this goes the determination of the 
Union of South Africa to be indepen- 
dent of England. 


@ The British Association for the 
Advancement of Science is meeting in 
Johannesburg, South Africa, this year 
and paying much attention to African 
history, sociology, archaeology and 
geology. 

@ Durban, South Africa, has become 
a center of native exploitation and un- 
rest, just as Johannesburg formerly 
was. The slums where the natives and 
Indians live are wretched beyond de- 
scription and practically nothing is 
done for social uplift. Recently, a race 
riot took place and there were five 
natives and one European killed, hun- 
dreds wounded, and as usual, one hun- 
dred natives arrested. 

@ One of the first duties of the new 
British Labor Government is to fur- 
nish capital for the Portuguese bridge 
across the Zambezi River. This 
bridge must span a channel three- 
fourths of a mile wide, and in addition 
to that, a mile and a quarter of low 
flats. The cost of the bridge is esti- 
mated at $5,000,000.

HE N. A. A. C. P. has loag had 

a Junior Division with a special 
constitution and by-laws. The object 
of this division is “‘to teach its members 
the history and achievements of the 
Negro race, to familiarize them with 
the lives of the distinguished men and 
women that the race has produced, 
and to cultivate in them an apprecia- 
tion of their worth; to develop inter- 
racial co-operation and understanding, 
and to train them in the work of the 
Association.” 

Membership in the Junior Division 
is “open to persons between fourteen 
and twenty-one years of age, who shall 
pay a membership fee of at least fifty 
cents—one half of which shall be sent 
to the National Office and the other 
half retained by the Junior Division. 

“On reaching the age of twenty-one, 
the Junior Division member shall be 
transferred to membership in the 


Branch, where he shall thereafter pay 


The Junior Crisis 


the usual membership of the Branch.” 

Each division has the usual officers 
elected by the Division and also a sort 
of Elder Brother (or Sister) known 
as the Director, appointed by the 
Branch of the N. A. A. C. P. under 
which the Junior Division works. The 
Division attends to all its own busi- 
ness except that it is subject to the gen- 
eral rules of the N. A. A. C. P. and 
must conform ‘to the policies of the 
parent branch. The Juniors are not 
independent, but they are granted as 
great a degree of independence as is 
compatible with their position, and the 
Director is a sort of liaison officer who 
advises them. 

The Juniors are represented at the 
annual conference of the N. A. A. 
C. P. and have a session all to them- 
selves which is usually very interest- 
ing. At the Cleveland Conference, 
1929, the Juniors made certain de- 
mands for recognition which THE 
Crisis is hereby heeding.

IDEALS 


HE great ideal of the United 

States of America is government 
by intelligent public opinion, freely ex- 
pressed by a ballot in the hands of all 
its adult citizens. ‘This ideal is not 
working, first, because the vast major- 
ity of Americans are not intelligent. 
Secondly, because most of them are in 
economic slavery. And thirdly and 
consequently, because we are ruled by 
organized wealth. 


A POET’S WAIL 
HE Charleston, S. C., News and 


Courier has an editorial about 
James Weldon Johnson’s “National 
Negro Anthem”. “It is,” says the Ed- 
itor, ‘a good piece of poetry bemoaning 
Negro slavery good stuff as 
far as such stuff goes, and it is not 
unnatural for Negroes to harp on the 
theme,—but isn’t it nearly time for 
intelligent Negroes in the United 
States to begin thanking the Lord for 
slavery?” And then the Editor ca- 
vorts like this: 

Do Negroes of the intelligence of 
Johnson really think that white men two 
hundred years ago might or should have 
brought their ancestors to the United 
States, settled them in comfortable 
homes, made them free and equal with 
the whites, and after clothing their naked 
bodies, clothed them with power to elect 
members of the colonial assemblies too? 
Are they genuinely regretting that their 
forefathers had the luck to work, as 
slaves, for the Southern planters? Why 
do not these Negro poets take the “Mid- 


Fe. SMart ft

dle Passage”, or any other passage, back 
to Africa and sing anthems in the jungles 
to the witch doctors? If any race on 
earth ought to be grateful to white 
Americans, especially to the Southern 
planters, it is the “race” in the United 
States. 

To which we beg leave to retort: 
Piffle! and also Nonsense! Negroes 
of any intelligence whatsoever are con- 
vinced that if white people had been 
the Christians which they pretended to 
be and had left Africa alone, Africa 
today would be little behind Europe in 
most things that can be called real 
civilization. That American slavery 
was an unmitigated calamity is, of 
course untrue—there is no such animal! 
but it was a horrible thing, terrible in 
its effects upon the white South, which 
today lags behind the whole nation in 
intelligence, health and culture; and 
upon black people whom it dragged 
through the mud of human degrada- 
tion. Many good things have surely 
come out of Negro slavery, just as we 
are told there is an excellent pavement 
in Hell. But this white Southern rot 
of talking about what black men ‘“‘owe” 
to Southern planters ought pretty soon 
to die a natural and well merited 
death. The larger part of the debt 
which we owe to the South consists of 
ignorance, poverty and bastards. 


THE YEAR 1929 


ROM the midyear of 1929, look- 
ing across the world inhabited by 
the darker peoples, what is the out- 


look, what is the hope, and where do 
the dangers lie? 

First of all, we recognize a great 
change in the last fifty years concern- 
ing any outlook for yellow, brown and 
black people. In the latter part of 
the 19th Century, large numbers of 
political philosophers were prophesy- 
ing the decline of the colored races, 
and the establishment of a political 
and economic world dominated by 
white Europe and America, with the 
colored peoples forming subordinate 
groups of disfranchised laborers. 


The theory was that this arrange- 
ment of the world was not a matter 
of -ethics, but of inevitable scientific 
determinism. Since those days of the 
“Survival of the fittest”, much has hap- 
pened, and greatest of all of these hap- 
penings has been the World War. 
The World War has brought humil- 
ity to the white’ world. It does not 
seem so certain today that white peo- 
ple have either the ability or the power 
to dominate and rule over all man- 
kind. 

We are beginning to recognize that 
if humanity is to grow and civilization 
to advance, it must have a broader 
base than Europe. Not only is there 
need of wider political Democracy, but 
also of deeper Democracy in thought, 
in art, and in knowledge of the truth. 
This dramatic change of outlook has 
come from the upheaval among the 
colored peoples, which began before the 
World War, but which the great War 


hastened toward a future climax.

THE DARKER WORLD 
OOKING specifically at the darker 


peoples, we can easily see their new 
development has only begun. The 
problem of Japan has changed since 
the war. Before the World War, ig- 
noring the color line, she essayed union 
with the great white nations, who were 
dominating Asia and Africa. The war 
brought her to a realization that she 
was classed as Asiatic and colored, and 
that her future lay in the development 
of the-colored world and in keeping 
watch and ward against the aggres- 
sions of Europe. ‘That little refusal 
of the League of Nations to take a 
firm stand for racial equality meant 
much to Japan, and began to open her 
eyes. She is still the polite co-worker 
with Europe, but her alliance with 
England will never be renewed. 
There is still deep antagonism between 
Japan and China which Europe, led 
by Great Britain, has done much to 
foment. But as national government 
in China strengthens itself, and as the 
basis of Democracy in Japan widens, 
the chances for understanding will in- 
crease. And when there comes be- 
tween Japan and China that strong 
alliance and unity of interest which is 
inevitable, the whole outlook of the 
world is going to be changed. The 
power and leadership of yellow Asia 
is going to be able to challenge suc- 
cessfully the assumptions of white 
Europe. 


« RUSSIA AND INDIA 


O this great future movement of 

the majority of mankind, there ap- 
proach two allies: Russia, with its 
attempt to organize a government for 
the benefit of the workers, rather than 
for the benefit of the present owners 
of capital; and on the other hand, In- 
dia, with its movement toward political 
autonomy. If white Europe insists on 
seeking to curb Russia, on the one 
hand, and on the other to keep India 
as a field for exploitation and in politi-

cal swaddling clothes, the spirit of eco- 
nomic revolution among all the peoples 
of Asia is going to be tremendously 
increased, and that too despite Jap- 
anese conservatism. 

On the other hand, there are signs 
that Great Britain, led by her trained 
political aristocracy, is going to fore- 
see the inevitable change and just as 
she was the first to substitute economic 
slavery in Africa for the foreign slave 
trade, so today she is among the first 
to recognize new China and may make 
at least some pretense toward political 
freedom in India. 

In a normal world the herculean ef- 
fort of China to reorganize one of the 
world’s oldest civilizations would 
arouse the greatest enthusiasm and 
sympathy. It is greeted today with in- 
credulity and misrepresentation and 
yet it is the greatest event save Russia 
since the World War and spells hope 
for more human beings than the Dec- 
laration of Independence. 

In Western Asia, there are signs of 
change, led by new initiative in Tur- 
key, Persia, and Afghanistan, and a 
determined spirit of independence of 
Europe. 


AFRICA 


N Africa, matters are more compli- 

cated because the enslavement of the 
working classes there, under the Euro- 
peans, reached a depth unheard of 
elsewhere in modern human history, 
involving the murder and transporta- 
tion of one hundred millions of beings 
in the 17th, 18th and 19th Centuries, 
and a resultant dislocation of author- 
ity and spoiling of custom and indus- 
try, among the dismembered peoples. 
Nevertheless, there persisted a faith and 
art and technique which even today 
have not been utterly effaced by the 
economic invasion of the machine age, 
and by capitalistic exploitation. In 
Egypt and on the West Coast, edu- 
cated natives are fighting for political 
voice with some success. The inde-

pendence of Egypt has been partially 
acknowledged. ‘The right to repre- 
sentative government in British West 
Africa has been acknowledged and a 
beginning made, while in North Africa 
some free institutions have been intro- 
duced and preserved. 

The Negroes of West Africa have 
not simply made a fight against monop- 
oly and English-owned machinery to 
gain a strong foothold in the oil and 
cocoa industry, but in the face of lies 
and political pressure, have forced 
England to break her system of abso- 
lute monarchy in the crown colonies 
and admit an elected minority to sit 
and vote in the governor’s council. 

The bitterest fight of Africa cen- 
ters in Kenya and in South Africa, 
where a determined attempt has been 
made by a minority of white people to 
steal the native’s land, keep him voice- 
less politically, and exploit him by eco- 
nomic serfdom. At the same time, 
native demand and liberal European 
public opinion has forced some modern 
education, and the next century is go- 
ing to see a bitter struggle between 
ideals of modern freedom and eco- 
nomic exploitation in Southeast and 
South Africa. The only reason that 
no such strife is yet evident in Belgian 
Congo is because too few natives have 
been given sufficient education to make 
even the beginning of protest against 
the terrible exploitation which still ex- 
pands in that land. 

The I. C. U. of South Africa—a 
Labor Union of Black men fighting 
for sheer existence against the white 
Unions and the Labor Party of South 
Africa,—is the bravest working class 
movement in the world since it is with- 
out a vote, without land, without the 
right to strike or even protest, and yet 
it is challenging the future of the 
Union of South Africa. It is today 
split in two and anti-Negro Hertzog 
has triumphed. But Hertzog is also 
anti-British and therein is a chance for 
black politics.

cept any title of martyr. . What they 
may have lost in material pleasures, 
they have gained, undoubtedly, from 
that holy satisfaction which comes 
from doing the right and one’s best. 
But their attitudes were not acceptable 
to the white Southerners nor to the 
Northerners who sought for a berth 
in Southern social circles. Some looked 
upon the consistent Christianity of Mr. 
Fenninger as an encouragement to “so- 
cial equality,” while others dismissed it 
by calling it a type of insanity. Not 
very long ago two trustees of the school 
are credited on good authority with 
having this exchange of views: 

Trustee No. 1—The trouble with 
Fenninger is that he is too outspoken; 
he has no tact, no restraint. In short 
he is just crazy. 

Trustee No. 2.—Remember that 
John Brown was called crazy, and so 
was Abraham Lincoln, and even Jesus 
Christ. 

The numerous incidents which unite 
to establish the consistent Christian 
attitude of Mr. Fenninger cannot all 
be recounted. Many of them have 
never been allowed to escape the fam- 
ily. As his attitude was a system of 
living and life rather than a spasmodic 
act done for effect here and there, he 
did not see anything fit for the head- 
lines in the things that he did. But 
some things are known. Students and 
followers of the Ministers’ Conference 
know that while higher school officials 
always arranged to have their import- 
ant Negro guests entertained by some 
Negro official, notably the command- 
ant of cadets, Mr. Fenninger has al- 
ways accepted and entertained in his 
own home some of the leading speakers 
of the Conference, regardless of color. 
Once when a higher school official had 
invited his Negro classmate at Yale to 
visit Hampton Institute, he hadn’t the 
strength of courage to go to the wharf 
and meet the boat nor to entertain his 
friend. His Southern friends might 
object to that. He insisted that Mr. 
Fenninger should meet the boat, and 


the chaplain finally did. Then there

was the question as to where the Negro 
visitor should eat. This higher off- 
cial, a fellow-classmate and also a di- 
vine, had invited him, but he could not 
have him at his own table. The school 
inn had already served supper. Where 
was the visitor to dine? The higher 
official was in a muddle. 

“T’ll take care of your guest,” said 
Mr. Fenninger as he turned away from 
the telephone to say to his wife (over- 
heard by a student working in the 
house at the time) : 

“We cannot allow this man to suffer 
humiliation, Natalie. We have already 
eaten but prepare him some supper. We 
shall be here by 6:45.” 

And so the Yale classmate of this 
higher official was met by the chaplain, 
and had his first bit of hospitality at his 
hands. 

Once the head of one of the largest 
foundations which dole out philan- 
thropy to Negro schools was visiting 
at the Fenninger’s. While he sat con- 
versing, a Negro minister descended 
from an upper room of the house. This 
executive, an ordained preacher him- 
self, flushed, but he managed to main- 
tain his composure—for four months. 
At this time he happened to meet Mr. 
Fenninger on a train in North Caro- 
lina, and after some time he remarked 
bluntly: 

“Say, Fenninger, don’t you think 
you are going too far?” 

Chaplain Fenninger understood and 
he made his reply. 


“As a Christian minister in a Negro 
community, what else would you have 
me do and still be a Christian?” 

There was no answer. The train 
sped on. 

For many years a Sunday School 
class has been conducted for the chil- 
dren of Hampton workers. One day 
an elderly lady, the wife of an instruc- 
tor and hailing from Massachusetts, 
remonstrated with Mr. Fenninger: 

“Why do you let your children walk 
to Sunday school with the [colored] 
children of Captain B ? Are you 
not afraid they will fall in love with 
each other?” 

“My good woman,” he answered, 
“I do not harbor any idea of five- and 
six-year-old tots falling in love.” 

And Mr. Fenninger walked on. 

During the student strike of 1927, 
Mr. Fenninger was neutral. He did 
not outwardly ally himself with the 
administration nor with the students. 
Yet the students were sure of one 
thing: Mr. Fenninger would be on the 
side of right. If he had anything to 
say, he would say it honestly, openly. 
When the administration was putting a 
lily-white guard around the homes of 
all white teachers and workers, they 
approached Mr. Fenninger and_in- 
quired: 

“How many guards do you want 
around your house? You have chil- 
dren.” 

Still consistent in his attitude, he re- 
sponded in words to this effect:

“Neither my family nor I have any 
fears. These students are all our 
friends.” 

Now that Mr. Fenninger is about to 
leave of his own accord for a much 
needed rest and a new field, he ought 
to go forward feeling that he has 
friends. ‘The Ministers’ Conference, 
his most worthy accomplishment, in ad- 
dition to his general influence, will feel 
his loss, for here, especially, the con- 
sistent Christian attitude of the man 
has been most outstanding. Every year 
he has invited some of the best minds 
in the world of religion, of both races, 
to address the conference and live side 
by side with its members. Contrary 
to the practice of other officials (sad, 
but true), he has never fallen a vic- 
tim to the practice of quietly draw- 
ing racial lines. Christian, human, 
brotherhood has prevailed. No ar- 
rangements were ever made which 
would in any way effect segregation or 
discrimination. If the Trustees’ House 
was good enough for the rector of 
Holy Trinity, the richest church in 
Philadelphia, it was not too good for 
the pastor of Abyssinian Baptist, New 
York; if his own home was hospitable 
enough for Dr. Julius Bewer, profes- 
sor of Old Testament at Union Theo- 
logical Seminary, it was not too good 
for Dr. P. O’Connell, professor of his- 
tory at Morgan College; if some white 
and some colored men were learned 
enough to be special lecturers at the 
conference, those same men were con- 
sidered gentlemen enough to meet at 
the same dining-table, at the same time; 
if the Negro ministers had something 
to learn from their white visitors, then, 
according to the thinking of Mr. Fen- 
ninger, the white preachers also could 
learn from the new contacts, the new 
point of view, the new spiritual en- 
vironment. 

The white visitors to the conference 
have always testified to the fact that 
the Fenninger-way has opened their 
eyes to new avenues of human relation- 
ship, and has given them unexpected, 
but pleasant, experiences. And the Ne- 
gro ministers realize what the work of 
Mr. Fenninger has meant.

what produces war; for under that 
great administration there was gather-

years in the United States a group of 
men who had been accustomed to see-

lives. And there is a natural instinct 
of men which causes them to feel that 
through someone, God or man, the

violence some time. And Mr. Palmer

imagination because he knew deep 
down in his heart that at this particy- 
lar moment war was probably due. 

America knows that it does not be- 
lieve that war can be eradicated from 
the earth, because America has not 
made up her mind to cease violence 
to the black man; and every sensible 
American knows that these black peo- 
ple are not willing hostages, and there 
are millions of black and yellow and 
brown people in the earth who look at 
what is happening to the black man in 
America just as constantly as a man 
looks at the thermometer to tell what 
the weather is, and they can see so 
plainly the trends that there is no state 
document, no conference between dip- 
lomats, which can remove from them 
that proper hesitation as to whether 
they will beat their swords into plough- 
shares or their ploughshares into 
swords. The tap root of the fear and 
suspicion that produce war the Negro 
knows—Violence in human relations. 

Religion 

As to religion: There are two great 
movements in America today to clarify 
the confusion existing in American re- 
ligion. One of them is an intellectual 
movement of an apologetic -nature 
which has for its proposition the over- 
coming of intellectual opposition of 
philosophy growing out of science and 
of philosophy growing out of tradi- 
tional and inherited religious concep- 
tions. The other movement is a move- 
ment toward the unification of the 
scattered outlines hoping to arrive at 
religious understanding by means of 
more powerful human organizations. 
But the Negro knows that the trouble 
with American religion is not primarily 
that. He knows that—that is, if he 
stops to think. Every thoughful man 
who has studied anything about the 
history of the great dominant religions 
in our country knows that the distinc- 
tive feature of the Christian religion 
was not its doctrine of love but the 
extension of the radius of love to in- 
clude all human beings instead of the 
members of one’s own race. The 
Christian religion became a powerful, 
world-embracing religion because it 
taught belief in a God inclusive of all 
living human beings as his children, 
showing great mercy toward every liv- 
ing creature. 

But in the very beginning of the 
residence of the Christian religion on 
the American soil, the presence of the 
black man caused a retreat of the radi- 
us; and the American people as a mat- 
ter of practical fact ceased to believe 
in the God and Father of Jesus Christ 
because they could not understand 
how black men and slaves could be in- 
cluded in the family of God on a basis 
of equality; and they ceased to ven- 
ture into the realm of human relations 
with black men on the basis of ethical

sincerity; and the instincts and the in- 
sights of American religious believers 
became fundamentally confused; for 
every man of any spiritual insight 
knows that the deepest source of in- 
sight into the meaning of religion in 
the world is neither philosophy nor or- 
ganized prayers but courageous moral 
action in the presence of living human 
beings. 

So that we are engaged in America 
today with the effort to recover by the 
juggling of words the insight and cer- 
tainty which can be obtained only by 
courageous and courteous treatment of 
every living human being around us. 
And the consequence is that we have 
in America today what is perhaps the 
saddest religious spectacle in the world 
—we have it right here in Cleveland— 
an organized Christian church, spend- 
ing millions of dollars in missions, by 
which it hopes to conquer the world 
for Christ; but which is so afraid of 
a handful of black human beings in 
its midst that it has retreated into the 
shell of a racial church and stands to- 
day in every American city as the 
leader of the instinct to go back that 
we have in the organized forces of 
American life. Right here in Cleve- 
land, if I do not mistake, the public 
schools will have on Monday morn- 
ning black people, yellow people, Jews, 
whatever kind of people, not afraid of 
teaching them A B C’s together, but 
this morning in the holy churches of 
our Lord Jesus Christ in the City of 
Cleveland, where above all else on 
God’s earth the thing to be taught 
must be taught by personal communi- 
cation, if you had a half dozen teaching 
white and black together it would be 
a phenomenon in American life. So 
that the very presence of these segre- 
gated churches in a great city is a 
standing invitation to the public school 
system to go back to the fearful thing 
when the bearers of culture will be 
afraid lest they are not powerful 
enough to communicate with people of 
a different color without breaking 
down their morale. There is the root 
of it. 


So that we are in a country which 
is troubled, and the nature of this 
trouble is nowhere more apparent than 
in this matter of the relation of the 
black individual to the American state 
and American organized life, upon 
which the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People has 
focussed its attention. 


Whatever else I have to say will be 
very brief, but I do want to say 
that the distinguishing feature of the 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People, it seems to 
me, is that it has focussed upon these 
social diseases through the most intelli- 


October, 1929 


gent, realistic, powerful and effective 
effort that is now available in the 
American commonwealth. There is 
no political party in America which 
can begin to compare with the Na- 
tional Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People with its persistent, 
powerful voice pleading with the 
American people not to desert the 
foundation stones of American democ- 
racy and be ensnared in the disease of 
lawlessness, in the disease of violence, 
in the disease of ethical cowardice in 
human relations.

one on the desire for education, the 
other on Negro religion. 

“Hearts in Dixie” is a fine film, 
skillfully avoiding the tabooed love in- 
terest and an ending which would 
show the results of educating young 
Negroes. But “Hallelujah” is a 
great drama. It touches the religion 
of a deeply superstitious people who 
took refuge from physical disaster in 
spiritual tradition, hope and phantasy. 
And to this King Vidor dared to add 
not simply the traditional mammy and 
the wild sex lure but a womanly Ne- 
gro woman—Miissy Rose, a slim dark 
and modest girl beautifully in love. 
Thus, the first time, such a character 
has appeared on the American stage. 

“Hallelujah” is beautifully staged 
under severe limitations; white folk 
are carefully omitted, although it 
strains the imagination to see a cotton 
gin or a convict gang without a swag-

gering white boss. On the other hand, 
the scenes of religious ecstasy rise to 
magnificent drama, unexcelled in my 
experience and singularly true to life. 
The shadow of hands, borrowed frank- 
ly from “Porgy” is effectively used and 
the conversion of Chick accomplishes 
sincerity despite the lurking comedy. 

It is the sense of real life without 
the exaggerated farce and horseplay 
which most managers regard as insep- 
arable from Negro character, that 
marks “Hallelujah” as epoch-making. 

It goes without saying that the 
characters do their parts superbly. And 
why not? King Vidor had choice of a 
neglected field overflowing with un- 
developed talent. The fine sensitive 
face and intelligent acting of Daniel 
Haynes was notable; the slim grace of 
Miss McKinney, the restraint of Miss 
Spivey and the playing of Harry Gray 
and Mrs. DeKnight were excellent. 
Even the kids danced as country boys 
would and not as city sophisticates. 

The music was lovely and while I 
would have preferred more spirituals 
instead of the theme-song, yet the world 
is not as crazy about Negro folk songs 
as I am. 

Everybody should see “Halleluiah”. 
They may even be slightly “Jim- 
Crowed” as I was, far forward on the 
side, where some of the scenes were 
distorted, but even then it was as fine 
an evening’s entertainment as I have 
had in many a day.

(Continued from page 347) 


I. C. U., the labor union of South 
Africa, was held last June. W. G. 
Ballinger, the white English Advisor, 
was one of the main speakers. The 
Organizing Secretary was appointed 
to proceed with Mr. Ballinger to 
Geneva. 

@ Clements Kadalie, founder of the 
Commercial Workers’ Union of Africa, 
has been ousted from his position and 
has founded an independent I. C. U. 
He is publishing New Africa in Jo- 
hannesburg as the organ of his Asso- 
ciation. 

@ A South African Institute for 
Racial Relations has been founded in 
South Africa under the Chairmanship 
of Dr. C. T. Loram. It has both col- 
ored and white members and has ap- 
pointed Rheinalt Jones of the Univer- 
sity of Witwatersrand as Scientific Ad- 
visor. 

@ Victor Poto, paramount chief of 
Western Pondoland, visited the South 
African Native College at Fort Hare 
recently. This Chief rules 100,000 
people and was trained in the South 
African Native College. He has 


founded the Farmers’ Association and 
increased farm production. He has 
also established a fund for education, 
modern courts with typewritten deci. 
sion and has built up schools ang 
churches. He came in a Chrysler 75 
sedan and remained as a guest of the 
school a week. 

@ There has been a serious rebellion 
in the Ubangi-Shari District of French 
Equatorial Africa. This is a plague 
spot for the exploitation of Negroes, 
and it is said that the black population 
which was nine millions in 1910 js 
less than three millions today. 

@ The Native Affairs’ Department of 
South Africa has appointed Mr. Lucas 
Molaba as Native agricultural demon- 
strator. He will work among the na- 
tives of the Potgietersrust District. 

@ The Cape African Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation met last June at Aliwal North, 
Cape Colony, South Africa. There 
were 100 delegates and visitors from 
all over the Cape Province. The 
Mayor, G. G. Visser, opened the Con- 
ference and the first Negro woman 
graduate of South Africa replied. The 
President was D. D. T. Jabavu. Mrs. 
Max Yergen took part in the program 
which lasted two days. They made a 
pilgrimage over the river to the Free 
State and as they crossed, the poet, 
Sese Rune Maayi, sang praises to the 
river.

a grown-up today. We kept up the 
annual Children’s Number, and grad- 
ually recovering strength and courage, 
we began in October, 1925, the de- 
lightful “Little Page” contributed 
monthly by Effie Lee Newsome. 

Now we are planning something 
better. As we see it, our past service 
has been partially nullified by some 
confusion in our own minds as to 
whom we were addressing. We have 
talked rather promiscuously to babies, 
children, adolescents and young men 
and women, classed higgledy-piggledly 
as “Children”. Much misunderstand- 
ing has resulted without doubt. So 
we are definitely taking a stand today. 

Henceforth, the babies will get an- 
nual attention in our October ‘Chil- 
dren’s Number”, and in Mr. Pickens’ 
occasional reports of Babies’ Contests. 
On the other hand, there will appear 
at least every other month and, if suc- 
cessful, every month, one or two pages 
called “THE Junior Crisis”. 

These pages will be the property 
of the Junior Division—that is, of 
the youth 14 to 21 years of age, who 
belong or want to belong or ought to 


belong to the N. A. A. C. P.

From such members an Editor-in- 
chief and two assistants will be se- 
lected by competition as follows: all 
members of Junior Divisions are hereby 
invited to send the THE Crisis on or 
before December First, 1929, an essay 
of 300 words on “How the JuNior 
Crisis shall be conducted and what it 
shall aim to do.” 

The writers of the First, Second and 
Third best essays shall be appointed 
respectively Editor-in-Chief and First 
and Second Assistant Editors. We 
shall need an Art Editor too, so that 
instead of essays some may send pic- 
tures or original photographs. Effie 
Lee Newsome has been invited to act 
as Critic of the page and be in general 
charge over the editorial staff. She 
and the Editors of THe Crisis will 
decide on the merits of the essays. 

So now, Juniors, come on and show 
us something. Remember, December 
First! 

Many will ask: “How can a Junior 
Division be formed?” Hf your city has 
a Branch select a group of young peo- 
ple and apply to the President, sug- 
gesting whom you would like as 
Director. A Branch may establish 
several Junior Divisions in the same 
city with different Directors. 

If there is no Branch of the N. A. 
A. C. P. in your city or near, or if 
you do not care to join the local divi- 
sion, you may become a member of 
the Junior Division-at-Large by writ- 
ing to the Director of the Branches,

Postscript 
(Continued from page 350) 


Here, then, we have an outlook to- 
ward a future of struggle; toward 
world-old effort to gain for ordinary 
human beings a place in the Sun, and 
the freedom to live and think for 
themselves. It depends in Asia and 
Africa as in Europe on the intelligent 
use of political power by the mass of 
laboring people. This art has not yet 
been Jearned in America and Europe 
by white workers who still help to 
disfranchise these darker people and 
beat them into submission by arms and 
force furnished by white owners of 
capital. 


WHITE LIBERALS 
MONG the educated and well-to- 


do, there are many who are im- 
patient at this pushing forward of what 
they consider lesser folk, and who would 
wish to confine their attention to such 
problems of the future as have to do 
with the leisure of Europeans and the 
political freedom of Englishmen, and 
the wealth of Americans of Anglo- 


October, 1929 


Saxon descent. But, fortunately, 
there can be no leisure, no freedom, no 
enduring wealth for the white minor- 
ity of mankind, even though today 
they are powerful, so long as the great 
dark majority of human beings are 
slaves. The future of the darker races 
is thus involved with the future of the 
white race, and all of us march, if we 
marcn at all, toward the physical sur- 
vival, the economic equality, and the 
spiritual freedom of all men of every 
race and color. 


THE INNER STRUGGLE 


HE dangers that front the rise of 
the darker people are many: They 
have not only to meet the organized 
and powerful opposition of white na- 
tions, but every human problem of or- 
ganization and development—educa- 
tion, class-distinctions, income, prop- 
erty, prejudice, crime, health—all 
these they must meet as new and inner 
group problems, and they must expect 
not aid and sympathy from the dom- 
inant surrounding civilization, but 
ridicule, disparagement and contempt. 
‘The darker people are poor and ig- 
norant, diseased and unhappy, and 
they are asked not only to conquer all 
this, but in the midst of the battle to 
achieve self-respect together with char- 
ity toward all men. 

Ta the van of this fight of the sub- 
nierged majority of men to stand and 
walk in this world are 12 million 
Americans of Negro descent. They 
are among the oldest group of Ameri- 
cans. They fought to make America 
free in 1776 and 1861 and they have 
borne not only the slavery and con- 
tempt of the rich, but the prejudice 
and ostracism of their white fellow 
workers. They have been disfran- 
chised, kept out of labor unions, legis- 
lated into ignorance and jails, yet they 
are among the best workers in Amer- 
ica, the makers of American music and 
art, and the only Americans who really 
believe in American democracy. They 
may eventually succeed in placing 
America again in the procession of lib- 
eralism instead of in the forefront of 
imperial oppression and reaction. 


The year 1929 is not yet gone. It 
is still with us. And what with the 
four great fall months, it may yet make 
many decisions for Peace and War, 
for Love and Hate, and Uplift and 
Downfall. We gird ourselves today 
for what is, in a sense, the year’s real 
beginning, after the rest or at least the 
change of summer. We ought to come 
back with new resolutions and new 
strength to take up the wide round of 
duty, after having had a little space to 
think it all over and to find ourselves 
in the midst of the turmoil and con- 
tradiction.

are the grandchildren of slaves. There is no dishonor in being slaves. There is dishonor 
in being slave-owners. But let us not think of honour or dishonour in connection with 
the past. Let us realize that the future is with those who would be truthful, pure and 
loving. For, as the old wise men have said, truth ever is, untruth never was. Love alone 
binds and truth and love accrue to the truly humble. 

Mahatmi Gandhi, Sabarmati, India.
