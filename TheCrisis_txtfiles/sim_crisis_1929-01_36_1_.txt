Gentlemen: 


On August 31, 1928, I was painfully hurt. It did not occur to me 
that I was a member of the Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc., until I re- 
ceived a request from my agent in Portsmouth, Va., to send in my sick 
card. The check for my benefits came forthwith, and assurance that 


they would continue until I was able to work again, and they have. 


I did not seek the company after being hurt, but it sought me 400 
miles away to be sure that I was cared for. Is it a friend? Is it true to its 
contracts? I say cheerfully, it is, and I most cheerfully recommend the 


Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc. to all of my race everywhere.

‘WHERE THERE IS NO VISION — 
THE PEOPLE PERISH” 


We have, in attractive pamphlet form, the statements of twelve nationally known 
Americans, in regard to Thrift and Life Insurance. For instance, Dr. DuBois, Editor 
of the Crisis, says, in regard to Life Insurance: 


In modern civilized life there are certain things which every man does. He is born; 
he is educated; he goes to work; he takes out life insurance; he is sick; he dies. Few of these 
things can be avoided, certainly not the first and the last. The degree of a man’s 
civilization is measured by the care which he takes of the other items. To be sure, uneducated 
men have succeeded; some men do not work, and perhaps a few serious men do not carry life 
insurance. But none of these omissions are to be recommended. All of them are essential to 
life. Sickness may be avoided to some extent; death never. Insurance is a method of making 
these the least possible burden upon the man himself, his friends, and his family.” 


There are included other equally informative statements from the following:

West Va. Collegiate Institute 
M. W. Dogan, President, 
Wiley University

methods to their colored prototypes.— 
Without the black folk on the “Ves-

Hoover and the rulers of South Amer- 
ica are exchanging amenities. With 
Haiti, Cuba, Santo Domingo and 
Nicaragua sticking out of his pockets, 
Mr. Hoover is assuring them all that 
the United States loves them terribly. 
They are replying with one voice, lead 
by President Gil: ‘Then let us alone.” 
—No one has yet suggested that King 
George V, if given a chance, would 
have set the world afire. Neither will 
his son.—Don’t forget that it was Gov- 
ernor Roosevelt of New York who 
wrote the illegal constitution of Haiti, 
thrust it down their black throats, then 
laughed about it—Nine hundred thou- 
sand miners are starving in Great Bri-

two thousand of them in Canada.—

The Miracle of the Kings 


Translated from the Spanish of R. Cansinos-Assens 


HE night was very cold and very 
blue. The snow had covered all 
the country-side with whiteness, and 
the far-away stars shining yonder in 
the last frontier of the sky seemed also 
to be of silvery snow, very cold and 
very white. 
All the windows of the house were

shut, and, next to the fire of the big 
hearth, the little girl, a poor little 
country girl, was watching the hem- 
lock logs burn, enthralled, with her 
hands over the fire and her heart filled 
with legends, because it was the night 
of the Epiphany. 

Soon, a sour and unfriendly voice, 


the voice of a cruel step-mother, re- 
sounded through the room: 

“Mary, didn’t I tell you to go to 
the fountain and fetch water? How 
is it you forgot?” 

The little heart of the girl trembled 
with fear every time she heard that 
voice.

The Three Kings, Gaspar, Balthasar and Melchior 


From Multscher’s “Adoration of Kings’. 


January, 1924 


Photographische Gesellschaft, Berlin 





“| had to go for wood this evening, 
Mother, and I forgot.” 
“Then go for the water right now.” 


IGHT now it was very late: little 
brother was sleeping in his pine 

cradle under the white hangings; 
father was smoking, with his hands 
resting on the table and his eyes blink- 
ing with dreams in the midst of the 
smoke of the black tobacco. 

“Right now for water?” 
girl dared to say. 

“Right now, lazy one. You ought 
to have brought it this evening.” 

Standing in the middle of the room, 
the little girl was thinking of the 
elves and the hobgoblins in the woods, 
of the wolves in the snow, and of the 
enchantments of the bewitching night 
outside the houses. Her moist and 
beseeching little eyes looked for pity, 
first in the eyes of her stepmother, and 
then in those of her father, who was 
smoking happily in the comfort of the 
warm house. 

But the father, who loved only his 
second wife, shouted too, “Go out, 
lazy one, go for water.” 


ESIGNED and silent, the little 

“girl went to the kitchen to get 
the heavy pitcher from the pine board. 
Girdling it with her arms with a ten- 
der gesture as if it were a load of 
roses, she placed it on her hip; and 
before going, she said pleadingly to her 
step-mother, “Will you place my little 
shoes on the window for the time the 
Magi pass?” 

“Oh, yes, I will beat you with them 
if you come late. Go away, lazy one.” 

Her eyes brimming with tears, the 
little girl had to lift, unaided, the 
heavy bolt which crossed the two pan- 
els of the old and heavy oak door 
against wolves and thieves. Her 
father continued to smoke impassively, 
near the warmth of the fire, next to 
the beautiful step-mother, who was 
fascinating him with her eyes. 

The breast of the little girl leaving 
the house was filled with sighs and 
with bitterness. Her eyes filled with 
tears, she sought consolation in the 
high stars that were looking down at 
ger maternally and serenely. The 
whole country-side was covered with 
snow; the roofs of the rustic houses 
seemed crowned with big, white tiaras. 
Little lights, silked with tenderness, 
were shining through the misty, 
whitish window-panes. The earth, put 
to sleep by the snow, was as if en- 
chanted under a pure dream of love. 
It was the night of the Magi, and the 
little children went to sleep very early 
in order to let the holy Magi pass in 
silence under their windows, and the 
little girl felt envy and sorrow and a 
great wish to have a good mother like 


8 


the little 


the other children. With the jug on 
her side and her little hands purple 
with cold, she took the road toward 
the fountain. 


HE fountain was in the very heart 

of the woods, beneath the 
branches of a walnut-tree a hundred 
years old. Up to the silent fountain 
the little girl went, her soul filled with 
dread. The water had frozen. On 
the spout was nothing more than a 
hard and white icicle. A great skein 
of snow hung on the metal frame. 

The little girl began to cry. If she 
went home now, her step-mother 
would beat her and call her lazy. 

Shivering with cold, she leaned 
against the trunk of the tree. “Oh, 
holy Virgin, where can I go for 
water?” Through the enchanted 
crystals of her tears, she saw the white 
woods filled with colors, mute and mys- 
tical, in the silence of the snow. 

The trees appeared to, be static saints 
wrapped in the dawn whiteness of 
their robes. jA candid promise reigned 
in the woods; it was the enchanted 
hour when, down to earth, over the 
snow-covered homes, come the angels 
of the Nativity. 

Soon her tears remained suspended 
in the eyes of the little girl, and her 
hands were raised to her little breast 
in a prayer. 

Silently, under the trees of the wood. 
advanced a brilliant cortege. 

The little girl saw tunics, shining 
and golden, and regal silks filled with 
pomp and majesty. There were three 
venerable and beautiful figures, with 
long white beards, just like the saints 
in the stone cathedral and like the 
Magi in thé pictures of her story-book. 


HROUGH the very road where 

the fountain was situated they 
were coming, mounted on_ strange, 
humpy horses. She had never seen 
their like before. Filled with fear 
and respect, she hid herself behind a 
tree to watch them pass. The foot- 
steps of the strange mounts made no 
noise in the snow. 

The royal riders spoke not a word. 
She could see them better as they came 
nearer. They looked like three won- 
derful kings come from distant realms. 
They wore on their heads rich, crim- 
son cloths, and on the cloths golden 
crowns, big and shining. Their tunics 
seemed long, pontifical brocades in a 
big festivity at the cathedral. 

One could readily see in their faces 
that they were not from the lands of 
the North. 

Their noses were aquiline, and their 
cheek-bones stuck out. But there was 
infinite sweetness in their black eyes. 
One of the three kings was a Negro. 


HE little girl had never seen , 
T Negro. And she noticed in ql! 
surprise that his eyes were even riche; 
in tenderness than those of the othe; 
kings. On the backs of the horses 
those strange, gigantic, and hump, 
horses, with their necks adorned with 
strings of beads and golden pieces, were 
piled toys. Little cardboard horses. 
windmills, charming clay figurine 
thumbed in heavenly leisure by the 
saints who once were artisans on earth, 
and bags chock-full of sweets, bon 
bons, and all kinds of delicious, tempt: 
ing, sugary tid-bits, prepared with the 
honey-sweetness of the beatitude oj 
the women saints who had been makers 
of sweetmeats in their convents, 

Behind the kings one could see com. 
ing three more horses, loaded with di- 
vine gifts and priceless treasures for 
children. 

When she saw them so near, the lit. 
tle girl could not any longer doubt. 
They were the Magi because they were 
exactly the same as those painted on 
the triptych of the cathedral. 

The little girl heard them speaking 
very low. The woods became filled 
with a sweet and divine clarity as the 
passed. 

The little girl heard: 

“IT wonder if the village is still far 
off. It is now three days since we left 
heaven through the golden door.” 


66 ND how .cold it is here,” said 

the black king. “Poor people 
who live in this country, oh, if I could 
only give them the sun of Ethiopia. 
The children are waiting for us in 
their dreams. In all likelihood, the 
village is near, and I want to give the 
finest toys to the children of this snow- 
covered land.” 

The little girl was mute with sur- 
prise. Not a single doubt remained 
that they were the three Magi: Gas- 
par, Melchior, and Balthasar. And 
at the same time she felt that a great 
joy in looking at the marvelous vision 
the little girl felt keen bitterness in 
thinking that they would soon pass 
under her window, they would 
not see her little shoes, and they would 
not leave any rich gift from heaven. 

The cortege had stopped as if in 
search of the road leading to the vil- 
lage. The little girl realized that this 
was the moment, and she must not let 
them go by. Determined, she came 
from behind the tree, and making 4 
solemn bow before the kings, she said, 
“Good evening to you, dear sirs.” 


ER voice was the purest and new- 

est silver. The Magi turned on 

her their sweet, paternal, and benign 
eyes; particularly, the eyes of the

CRISIS 








Guadeloupe for THE Crisis prais- 
ing its beauties of nature and its kind, 
easy-going inhabitants with their sweet 
French manners, a terrible catastrophe 
blew out of the sea, laid its luxuriant 
vegetation low, and almost wiped out 
certain of its towns. Pointe-a-Pitre 
suffered the worst and though the con- 
sular building remains standing, it is 
much damaged. ‘The corrugated iron 
roof was taken off, doors blown in, a 
partition felled, and much minor dam- 
age done. Our things, such as furni- 
ture and household effects, are nearly 
all ruined. Our lives are saved, grace 
a Dieu, though there are hundreds of 
dead. 

Let me relate some details of our 
experiences which may interest you, 
even from my inadequate pen. 

We had rented a pretty and solidly 
built summer house or villa, in the 
mountains at Trois-Riviéres for the 
hot months and my husband came up 
for the week-ends, except when the 
arrival of a steamer Sunday prevented. 

On Wednesday, September 12th, a 
terrible wind arose before day and by 
ten o'clock it was blowing a perfect 
gale accompanied by driving storms. 
We (my “bonne” and I and her little 
girl of seven) stood on the veranda 
as long as we could, watching the fury 
of the storm and noticing what trees 
were losing their branches, not real- 
izing that a cyclone was bearing down 
upon us. But soon we were obliged 
to come inside and close all of the 
doors. We have no windows. At this 
moment, a neighbor’s little girl ran 
over saying that her mother had gone to 
market and had not yet returned, what 
was she to do? “Stay here,” I said. 
Later she saw her mother coming, 
struggling against the wind and ran 
out and brought her in. Her mother 
had fallen twice and bruised her leg. 
While we doctored the bruises with 
hot salt water, the father came over 
also and said that a cyclone from 
around Martinique was predicted for 
Guadeloupe that night. 


J UST as I had finished an article on 


T noon when my “bonne” spread 

the table and prepared to serve 
something to eat, the wind suddenly 
shifted from northwest to south, blew 
the bed-room door open as it went and 
drove in a wetting rain. After that, 
there was no more thought of eating. 
We were all busy locking and barring 
doors to the south, inside and outside 
ones, realizing that the cyclone was

The Hurricane

(Wife of the American Consul) 


upon us already. 

My thoughts went anxiously to my 
husband there alone in Pointe-a-Pitre. 

The storm grew more and more 
furious every minute. Other neigh- 
bors came in for refuge and the wo- 
man with the bruised leg was crying 
and praying and calling on all of the 
Saints. I heard repeated again and 
again Saint Marie, St. Joseph, St. 
Christopher, till I grew nervous and 
retired to the north bed-room and lay 
down to still my beating heart and 
wait, not knowing whether this mon- 
ster wind would pass and leave us 
safe or wipe us all out in its course. 
The rain poured in torrents, the wind 
whistled, roofs blew off, trees and 
branches fell on and around the house, 
and the air was full of sounds of de- 
struction. The little girl curled up 
on the bed beside me crying with fear 
and her mother soon joined in. [| 
tried to reassure them, saying that the 
house was too solidly constructed to 
be blown down, but that our roof 
might go. I was not certain though. 

For three solid hours the rain fell 
in torrents and the wind blew an aw- 
ful gale; but the end was not yet. By 
this time, part of our corrugated roof 
had been ripped off, making an_in- 
fernal noise and the water began drip- 
ping down into the dining room from 
above. We lay low and let it drip, 
awaiting either death or an abatement. 
One thing that comforted me a little 
was that I’ve long had the impression, 
or presentiment, that I was not to die 
by violent means, and another thing 
was the thought that Pointe-a-Pitre, 
situated on a sort of bay or channel, 
was more protected than here. 


FTER five o'clock there was a 

slight calm, but the rainy deluge 
continued with hardly a minute’s let 
up. By six, the wind had considerably 
decreased and I could move around 
and see how the others were faring. 
I found them frightened, chilly, and 
uncomfortable, but calmer. Water 
was two or three inches deep in the 
dining room and dripping from the 
ceilings more or less everywhere, even 
on the beds. We turned and pulled 
the things around to avoid the drops 
as much as possible, while the storm 
still raged. 

At length we made the wet and cold 
guests as comfortable as possible, dis- 
tributed a little food and wraps and 
again lay down, but not to sleep. The 
strong wind and heavy showers con- 






tinued until after midnight, when an 
abatement was quite perceptible and 
one could doze off a bit. 

Next morning we looked out on a 
scene of deyastation and ruin unimag- 
inable. Not a tree, nor a shrub in the 
vard was unharmed. All had been 
either uprooted or denuded of leaves 
and branches; pieces of roofing and 
wreckage lay all around and every 
house in the neighborhood was dam- 
aged or demolished. Desiccated leaves 
in abundance were scattered over the 
sides of our house and up under the 
veranda roof, several outside doors 
blown off their hinges and the balus- 
trade of the veranda lacking in places. 
However on looking around we noticed 
so many others houseless or roofless 
that we felt blessed after all. 

I had even thought of telegraphing 
Mr. Hunt first thing in the morning 
but saw that all wires were down and 
all means of communication cut off. 


HE beautiful trees on the hill op- 

posite me that I love so much to 
look at were missing altogether or 
lifting their naked, barren branches to 
the sky, a piteous sight. There was a 
clear view of the sea now still angry 
and raging where I had before only a 
glimpse of banana and mango leaves. 

All day long no news from “the 
Pointe” and then, next morning, the 
most distressing reports of terrible de- 
struction by wind and sea, of houses 
felled and numerous persons drowned. 
You can imagine my state of mind! 
‘Towards noon, however, a young man 
living near the consulate came in to 
say that Mr. Hunt was all right as 
he saw him just as he himself was leav- 
ing on foot to see how his mother had 
fared at G , a little farther on. 
By boat and on foot over fallen trees 
and other debris he had taken a day 
and a half to travel some sixty kilo- 
meters. I shall always love that bo 
both for his filial devotion and for the 
good news he brought me. 

Two days later the route was 
opened up by convict labor as far as 
the Riviére Salée (Salt River), a nar- 
row channel separating the Basse- 
Terre side of the island from Pointe- 
a-Pitre, and the next day I was en 
route for the Pointe, as it is commonly 
called, with a friend and her husband. 
At the Salt River were dozens of auto- 
mobiles and a great crowd soliciting 
boats to be ferried across om te-a- 
Pitre, for the bridge had been blown

N the City of New Orleans slightly 

more than a decade and a half ago, 
Ernest Morrison was born, the first 
child of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Morri- 
son. About six months later, Mr. 
Morrison, a government employee in 
the Southwest, was granted a leave 
to California on account of trouble 
with his eyes. Later the interesting 
little family was united in Los Angeles. 
Despite the trouble with his eyes, Mr. 
Morrison was fascinated by the rapidly 
growing moving picture industry, and 
had no difficulty in seeing clearly the 
possibilities for those who would begin 
at the bottom and work hard. With 
this vision and the determination to 
succeed, this ambitious father coached 
his young hopeful and at the age of 
a year and a half, he began his moving 
picture career as an infant extra for 
the princely compensation of a dollar 
and a half a week. 

This, humble beginning was imme- 
diately crowned with success. A short 
time after his first appearance the 
promising little extra was featured as 
Sunshine Sammy co-star with Baby 
Marie Osborne in a regular photo- 
play. For three years following the 
little boy was featured in two and 
three reel comedies in which Harold 
Lloyd and Snub Pollard played the 
important adult roles. At the age of 
seven years he became the star of the 
“Our Gang” Comedies and was fea- 
tured first in “The Little Piccaninny”. 
His sister, the original Farina, created 
a stellar role in her own right in the 
Gang. Movie fans the world over 
recall the many fine productions in 
which this little star was featured for 
about seven years. It was quite an in- 
teresting trail from the role of an in- 
fant extra at a dollar and a half a 
week to a juvenile star at five hun- 
dred and fifty a week. 


T this, apparently the zenith of 

his career, it seemed that his 
producers wanted to feature one of the 
lesser lights to share the hard earned 
and thoroughly deserved honors’ of 
Sunshine Sammy. This arrangement 
was refused outright by the father and 
as a result his little boy left the screen. 
His actions in this particular case were 
criticised very severely by those who 
knew the facts and perhaps even more 
by those who knew nothing about the 
situation. However, Mr. Morrison 
felt that his son should remain the star 
of the group because by his own ability 
he had contributed more than anybody 
else to establish “Our Gang” in the

hearts of movie fans. 

During the three months following 
his withdrawal from the screen much 
time was spent in rest and some in the 
preparation of a vaudeville act con- 
ceived by Mr. Morrison. In going

Calendar Chat 


UR old friend Janus again! Jan- 

uary always makes one think of 
this Roman god who long ago was 
supposed to guard the commencement 
of each year. On the first day of the 
year people would dress in their finest 
clothing and exchange pleasant greet- 
ings in the market places and on the 
streets. And they would make gifts of 
appetizing honey cakes and dates and 
figs and all sorts of confections. 

“Father of the morning’ was 
another name for Janus. The Roman 
people bowed to him at the dawn of 
day for he was believed to be not only 
the guiding spirit of the new year but 
also of the new day. He is represented 
by a figure with two faces, one sup- 
posed to be gazing toward the begin- 
ning and the other the ending of affairs. 
We mentioned these two faces in a 
previous “Calendar Chat”’. 

The first month of the year was held 
sacred to Janus and named for him by 
Numa far back in the past. So every 
New Year that comes is after all at- 
tended by very old traditions. 


The Old Woman 


SAW an old woman in blueberry color 
Come up with a basket from out of 
the cellar. 
‘Good woman, pray tell me, just what’s 
, in your hamper?” 


“If I were to tell you, you surely would 
scamper,” 

That’s all that she answered, and hurried 
away, 


And I’ve never seen her again since that 
day.

Spider and Amber 


HE walls of amber hoid fast many 

a spider that centuries ago, as resin 
came slowly trickling down a tree, has 
been borne onward with the sluggish 
stream and imprisoned as were other 
insects—and lizards—through all the 
countless years required to make amber 
of resin. How valuable the amber that 
comes set with encaged insects! How 
decorative my demure little lady spider 
sitting like a tiny brown teapot in the 
gold! 

I've gone to our Norway spruce 
hedge at dawn and found spider web 
strands flashing with dew like holiday 
tinsel for fairies. And it really seemed 
not so bad after all, this business of 
being a spider. I believe you remem- 
ber about Arachne. I’ve never known 
whether or not you and I are expected 
to feel sorry for her. 

Minerva being a goddess was sup- 
posed to excel in everything just as 
certain classes of people because they 
are of one variety feel that necessarily 
they handle all matters better than 
others. Busy pretty little Arachne said 


The Guard and the Children. 


that she produced finer needlework 
than the goddess Minerva, and maybe 
she did. But Minerva was so disgusted 
by this declaration from a mere mortal 
that she turned the-little thing into a 
spider and still Arachne is working 
with exquisitely dainty threads though 
Minerva has become a part of the 
vapor of vesterday’s dreams. 


My Palace 
WISH those roundish silver spots 
On butterflies were money. 

I’d save them in my pocketbook 

To buy just such a lovely nook 

As I have very often planned, 

Right in the heart of fairyland, 

And spend some drops of money dew 

For peacocks trimmed with golden blue. 


I’d have my air perfumed with hints 
Of hidden thyme and peppermints. 


And all within my garden walls 
You'd hear the little veery’s calls. 
My castle spires should tower high 
With glassy roofs to show the sky 
In rose and gold and violet 

At dawn, through day and at sunset.

THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 


¥ 








4 NEGRO SEA HERO 


HE motion picture camera men 

were turning the cranks of their 
machines in front of the City Hall 
Building of New York. On the steps 
stood a small group of people while an 
admiring crowd watched from the 
Plaza. Down on this scene looked the 
soaring tower of the Woolworth 
Building. Opposite was the old Fed- 
¢ al Building, in which testimony was 
being taken concerning the sinking of 
te steamship Vestris, off the Virginia 
Coast, with a loss of one hundred and 
eleven lives. 

In the center of the group on the 
City Hall steps, small, neatly dressed, 
black, with a firm chin line, quiet 
demeanor and a smile that showed two 
rows of very white teeth, stood Lionel 
Licorish, Barbadian quartermaster of 
the Vestris, who single handed saved 
twenty. lives, kept a life-boat full of 
people afloat for twenty-four hours 
during a gale, and then modestly ad- 
mitted he had “done his duty”. Next 
to Lionel Licorish, also small, and dap- 
per, and smiling, with a twinkle, stood 
the Mayor of New York City. On 
the other side of Licorish, stood Nathan 
Straus, whose efforts in behalf of good 
milk for babies are known throughout 
the country. Beside the Mayor stood 
Grover Whalen, who has welcomed 
royalty to New York City, and others 
in the group included Charles H. 
Tuttle, United States Attorney in 
charge of the Vestris inquiry, and 
James Weldon Johnson, Secretary of 
the National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People. 

There were many who had come to 
the City Hall for this occasion. They 
included clergymen, editors, among 
them Alderman Fred R. Moore, editor 
of the New York Age; W. H. Davis, 
editor of the Amsterdam News, and 
many others well known in the life 
o& Harlem and of New York City. 
They were present at the highest honor 
the city could bestow on any citizen: 
an official welcome by the Mayor. 


= addresses delivered in the official 
welcoming room of the City Hall, 
the reason for these ceremonies was 
made quite clear. Speaking for the 
N. A. A. C. P., Mr. Johnson said he 
took a pardonable pride in emphasizing 
the fact that of the heroic actions in 
one of the worst sea disasters that had 
ever occurred off the American coast 
the outstanding act of bravery was that 


12 








Lionel Licorish 


of a colored man. It showed, he said, 
that courage knows no limitation of 
race, creed or color. 

UL. S. District Attorney Tuttle, 
who followed Mr. Johnson, spoke of 
his gratification at being able to be 
present and to pay tribute to a man 
who had shown not alone bravery but 
intelligence. Mr. Tuttle described the 
action of Lionel Licorish as “a shaft of 
light stabbing the darkness” of the 
night that hung over the Vestris dis- 
aster. He added, speaking as United 
States Attorney in charge of the fed- 
eral inquiry, that no witness on the 
stand had more favorably impressed the 
commission or had told a more intelli- 
gent straightforward story than this 
same little black quartermaster from 
the Barbadoes. This statement com- 
ing from Mr. Tuttle was the more im- 
pressive, in that a cowardly attempt 
had been made to throw the blame for 
the sinking of. the vessel upon a 
“mutiny” of the black gang, the fire- 
men, who had stuck by their posts and 
by orders until the last moment and 
had left the Vestris only a few minutes 
before she sank into the depths of the 
ocean. 

The N. A. A. C. P., incidentally 
had promptly characterized this attempt 
to slur the black gang as a cowardly 
subterfuge, pointing out to the news- 
papers and people of New York and 
the nation, that it was only the officers 
of the Vestris whose memories of the 
disaster were vague and confused; that 
there had been no semblance of disci- 
pline or centralized authority on the 
ship and no orders issued for the safety 


zs 
De 


of the passengers; and that the men 
who behaved in heroic fashion and later 
told honest, clear and straightforward 
stories before the investigating commis. 
sion were Negroes: Lionel Licorish and 
Joseph Boxhill, a colored fireman. 


HE third speaker to pay tribute to 

Lionel Licorish, was the aged 
Nathan Straus, who said that this was 
his first visit to the City Hall and that 
it took such an act of bravery and an 
opportunity to pay tribute to it such 
as this to bring him there. He said 
emphatically that one of the dreams of 
his youth had beer to save a human 
life, and that there had been no human 
being he was more anxious to meet than 
quartermaster Licorish. 

The last speaker but one at this im- 
pressive occasion was M..,or James 
Walker of New York. The Mayor 
spoke of the city, the greatest in the 
Western Hemisphere, probably the 
greatest in the world. He touched upon 
the various races and nations repre- 
sented in its population. Turning then 
to quartermaster Licorish the Mayor 
said: 

“When you left that ship and 
reached out your hands to save some- 
one else’s life, it is fair and reasonable 
to suppose that no one asked you what 
race you belonged to—no one asked 
you where you were born and no one 
was interested in your color. They 
were mighty glad to have your arms 
around them and they were mighty 
glad to accept the help you brought 
them. 

“That was all right out there in the 
raging waters. That was fine when 
the ship was going down. But I am 
rather inctined to believe that if we did 
a little more while the ship was sail- 
ing smoothly, along the same line, if 
we had the same willingness to accept 
assistance and the same absence of dis- 
crimination, even this would be a 
greater country than it is today.” 

Finally, Lionel Licorish, asked to do 
what was probably the “hardest job in 
a quartermaster’s life”, to reply to an 
address by the Mayor of New York, 
stood quietly and addressed the gather- 
ing. He said he would wish no one to 
go through what he had endured 
through a long night some two weeks 
before. He would not wish to go 
through it again. But it was a great 
thing to have come through it and be 
alive this day. Then, with a flash of 
smile that brought a sympathetic re-

THE PSALM 
By ANNICE CALLAND 


‘During the several years spent in the 
West Indies, I resided for almost a year 
in the city of Saint Marc, Haiti. While 
stopping at the hotel there I met a Ne- 
sro woman of great influence in Haiti 
during the years Guilliame Vilbrun Sam 
was President of Haiti. At the time I 
was in Saint Marc, she was managing 
the hotel there and as we _ became 
acquainted, she told me many interesting 
stories of the West India Negroes, 
The Psalm’ being one of them. I do not 
vouch for the truth of the story and 
neither did she for that matter, but I 
loved her stories and have been trying 
to put them into poems. 

“The dialect used is that of the less 
fortunate English speaking Negroes of 
British governed Islands as I remem- 
ber it.”

His soot black body was six-foot-two; 
His muscles rippled and rolled 
Like the waters of a sleek, jet black

Was his nose convex like a beak. 

His golden voice flowed like sunlight

He drew himself up tall;

His hearers cried out hysterically; 
Their African fervor soared. 
Till—“No damned Jamaican kin save

A black Barbadian roared.

Yo’ lyin’ whelp of a spy?” 
Lance said: “I is come for de God Al-

One thing struck hard on Lance as he 
entered, 
Four rings in the wall of stone, 
Four rings where a man could be spread-

And no friend hear his moan. 


“Dere’s jes’ one way to kill a Jamaican,” 
Their brutal chieftain said. 
“De Psalm! De Psalm!” his comrades

They felt he was good as dead. 


Their forbears living in Africa

To kill let a proper curse be uttered, 
Foes died invariably then.

In ringing words Lance defied his 
enemies: 
“Yo’ kin pray till yo’ lose your breath; 
Burn a thousan’ caandles, sing ten thous- 
an’ Psalms, 


Yo’ kin never pray I to death!” 


The roar of hard hands on drumheads 
thundered 
And broke the midnight calm; 
The Barbadian chief flung his arms in 
the air 
And began the chosen Psalm: 
“Hol’ not Thy peace, O God of our 
praise,” 
His voice cried in the gloom. 
It was the most powerful curse they 
knew, 
More final than Voodoo Doom. 


With howls like wild beasts scenting 

meat 
His followers made reply: 

“For de mouth of de wicked an’ de 
mouth of de deceitful has opened 
agains’ us: 

He has spoken agains’ us with a lyin’ 
tongue.” 


With black bodies bending in unison, 
With outflung arms, all cried:

@ Miss Edith G. Brown recently has 
been appointed as a teacher in the his- 
tory department of the Girls Memor- 
ial High School of Boston, Mass., 
where she has been teaching for the 
past two years under temporary ap- 
pointment. Miss Brown, who re- 
ceived the M. S. degree from Boston 
Teachers College, is the first Negro 
to receive appointment to teach in the 
high schools of Boston. 
@ When the Springfield College 
cross-country team ran against the 
West Point Cadets recently, it was 
minus the services of M. M. Greene, 
colored captain of the Springfield team, 
because of a West Point ruling pro- 
hibiting colored boys from participa- 
tion against the Cadets. 
@ O’Brien’s “Best Short Stories of 
1928” includes the work of three 
members of the Saturday Evening 
Quill Club of Boston, Mass.: “An 
Unimportant Man”, by Dorothy 
West; “Coldblooded” and “Alien’’, by 
Eugene Gordon; and “Black Mad- 
ness” by Gertrude Schalk. 
@ Bequests of $50,000 each were 
made to Hampton Institute, Tuskegee 
lastitute, and Calhoun Normal School, 
according to the terms of the will of 
Mrs. Ida Means Mason, Boston, 
Mass. 


THE MIDDLE STATES 


@ When the Paul Laurence Dunbar’ 


Apartments, Incorporated, were plan- 
ned, a vital question was their man- 
agement. It would have been, per- 
haps, natural, to have appointed a 
white man as manager on the ground 
that few Negroes had the requisite 
experience; but Rockefeller interests 
decided to make a colored man the 
manager and chose Roscoe Conklin 
Bruce. Mr. Bruce is the son of the 
only Negro Senator who served a full 
ferm and his mother was the first col- 
ored school teacher of Cleveland, 
Ohio. He was born in 1879, edu- 
cated at Phillip Exeter and Harvard 
College, where he was noted as a mem- 
ber of the University debating society 
and won the Phi Beta Kappa key. 

@ He began as a teacher, directing 
the academic department of Tuskegee 
for four years; then he became super- 
vising principal of the public schools 
of Washington; and finally for four- 
teen years, assistant superintendent in 
charge of the colored schools of the 
District. Mr. Bruce resigned in 1921 


14 


Rosco C. Bruce 


after a long controversy which THE 
Crisis commented on at the time. He 
became principal of the Brown Creek 
District High School, Kimball, W. 
Va., and finally, in 1927, he became 
Resident Manager of the Paul Laur- 
ence Dunbar Apartments and Director 
of the Dunbar National Bank. Mr. 
Bruce has had a long and useful career 
and has done the unusual thing of 
changing from one profession to an- 
other with success. 

@ The old idea of man and help- 
mate as the economic foundation of 
the marriage relation has been rather 
upset in our day by the change in wom- 
en’s work. Not every educated wom- 
an wants to be a cook and maid even 
for her husband and Mrs. Clara Bur- 
rill Bruce has solved the problem -in 
another way. She was educated in the 
public schools of Washington, taught 
at Tuskegee, and, marrying Mr. Bruce, 
took her. place as housewife and 
mother. Then in 1923 she entered 
the law school of Boston University, 
made a distinguished record, being 


Mrs. Clara B. Bruce 


a

me 


editor-in-chief of the Law Review, 
member of the student council and 
class day orator. Mrs. Bruce main- 
tained the highest scholastic record fo; 
three years, and was awarded the Rob- 
inson Prize and the Woolsack key. 
She was admitted to the bar in 1926 
and then joined her husband as assist. 
ant manager and attorney of the Dun- 
bar Apartments. 

@ Late in October, “The Nazarene 
Players’, under the direction of Rich- 
ard B. Harrison, nationally known 
dramatic reader, presented ‘Diana of 
the Ephesians” in the Little Theatre 
of Nazarene Congregational Church, 
Brooklyn, N. Y. 

@ Ira D. Reid, who has been serving 
as Industrial Secretary of the New 
York branch of the Urban League 
since 1925, has been made Director of 
the Department of Research and In- 
vestigation of the National Urban 
League, succeeding Charles S. John- 
son, who is now a professor at Fisk 
University. 

@ Gus Moore, 21 year old Negro, 
and a former scholastic mile champion, 
won the national cross country cham- 
pionship race at Van Cortlandt Park, 
New York City, recently. Mr. 
Moore was 100 yards in the lead of 
his nearest competitor. His victory is 
the first scored in this classic by an 
American born runner since 1921, and 
his time for the six mile course was 
31 minutes, 18 seconds. 

@ On November 1, Charles Greene, 
a colored man, became a junior clerk 
in the legal department of the New 
York Central Railroad, the first of his 
race to fill such a position, Mr. 
Greene has been with the New York 
Central for ten years, first as attendant 
and then as clerk, while he was at- 
tending Fordham College and Ford- 
ham Law School, New York City. 
@ Mrs. Blanche Brookins, who in 
July, 1927, was put in jail at Jack- 
sonville, Fla., and fined $500 because 
she refused to be transferred to a Jim 
Crow car, has recently been awarded 
$2750 from the Atlantic Coast Line 
Railroad. This case, which was hand- 
led by the N. A. A. C. P., through 
its attorney, Arthur Garfield Hayes, 
emphasizes that passengers in inter- 
state trafic are not subject to Jim- 
Crow regulations of Southern states 
without equal accommodation being 
furnished by the railroad.

to petitions signed by neighbors, the 
City Council passed an ordinance mak- 
ing it unlawful for anyone to keep in- 
fected animals for treatment within

WEST AFRICA 


@ Speaking to the Congo Labou: 
Commission on the question of the 
alleged lack of discipline among the 
natives of the Congo, Colonial Min. 
ister Jasper said that the natives were 
not in a state of latent revolt. The 
Colonial Office at Brussels, is studying 
the question of penalities to be im- 
posed in cases of indiscipline and is 
thinking of reintroducing corporal 
punishment. 

@ The Colonial Office is considering 
proposals for a new constitution for 
Achimota College, the chief feature be- 
ing control by a council representing 
both races: four members to be ap- 








pointed by the Governor; six African 
members, one of them a woman; four 
elected by the staff and the Principal. 
@ The first native Catholic priest of 
Dahomey, Fr. Thomas Moulero, has 
recently been ordained at Ouidah. At

Bishop of Accra, Missionary Equip- 
ment Supply, Church House, S. W. 

@ Refusal of a white club at Bamako, 
French Soudan, to admit a Negro off- 
cer has aroused much discussion in the 
Soudan and in France, and has brought 
about the resignation of every white 


officer in the club. Captain Bebel, a 
native of the French West Indies, was 
proposed for membership in the Soudan 
Club upon his arrival at Bamako. The 
president of the club replied that in a 
special session the members had de- 
cided to refuse admission to Captain 
Bebel “in conformity with its rules”. 


SOUTH AFRICA 


q@ W. B. Madeley, Minister of Posts 
and Telegraphs in the Union of South 
Africa, was asked to resign when he 
met a deputation from the Industrial 
and Commercial Workers’ Union, a 
native organization which is aiming to 
obtain higher wages and better condi- 
tions of labor for native workers. Mr. 
Madeley, a Socialist who was nomi- 
nated by the Labour Party, refused to 
resign and Premier Hertzog tendered 
his own resignation to the officer ad- 
ministering the Government, where- 
upon he was invited by the officer to 
form a new cabinet. Mr. Madeley was 
the only member dropped and his place 
was filled by H. W. Sampson. who rep- 
resents the Nationalist wing of the 
Labour Party. The incident which 
led to Mr. Madeley’s dismissal is gen- 
erally regarded as a pretext on the part 
of the Prime Minister to rid himself 
of a person who has been a thorn in the 
side of the Government for several 
months. 


Zulu Girls, Rhodesia, South Africa 


@ Following on the round-table cop. 
ference held in Cape Town recently 
an inquiry into the question of the 
housing and sanitary conditions of 
Indians in and around Durban has 
been started. The principal witnesses 
are the Mayor and Members of the 
Council, who advocate the housing of 
the poorer class of Indians in a native 
village about a mile and a half outside 
the borough boundaries. The Indian 
community, oppose the proposal on the 
ground that it amounts to compulsory 
segregation. ; 
@ Twelve South African educational 
and cultural leaders will visit the 
United States during the next year un- 
der the auspices of the Carnegie Cor- 
poration of New York, for the pur- 
pose of studying American public 
school systems and other agencies of 
education and culture. 

@ A conference was held in Bloem- 
fontein in October, to consider hold- 
ing an African Exhibition in South 
Africa in 1932. 

q W. P. Johnson, of the Universities’ 
Mission of Central Africa, after fifty- 
two years of work in Africa, died in 
October at Luili, on Lake Nyasa. Mr. 
Johnson became Archdeacon of Nyasa 
in 1896 and Canon of Likoma Cathe- 
dral in 1922. From 1925 until his 
death, he was in charge of the Mis- 
sion Station at Manda.

NEGRO ART IN EUROPE 
OLAND HAYES begins his fifth 


annual tour in America this win- 
ter and will sing in Akron, Ann Arbor, 
Boston, Bridgeport, Buffalo, Charles- 
ton, W. Va., Indianapolis, Lexington, 
Ky., Los Angeles, Louisville, Milwau- 
kee, New Haven, New York, Oak- 
land, Omaha, Portland, Ore., Provi- 
dence, Rochester, Sacramento, Salt 
Lake City, San Francisco, Spokane, 
Springfield, Mass., St. Louis, Toledo, 
Toronto, Vancouver, Washington, 
Waterbury, and Wellesley, Mass. 
This gives interest to an interview with 
Roland Hayes published in the Am- 
sterdam, Holland, Telegraph last Jan- 
uary. We quote part: 


At our first meeting he had already 
said without any pretense and in his 
gentle kindness: “An interview? All 
right, but you shall have to do the talk- 
ing. I haven’t the gift to tell all that 
there is for me to say.” 

And, in the large dark reception room 
of his hotel he sat awaiting his lot, re- 
signed. He is ready to declare that the 
Amsterdam audience is the most artistic 
in the world and Amsterdam the finest 
city he has ever seen, that he knows no 
“ensemble” like the Concert Cebouw 
Orchestra and that he had always longed 
to visit Holland, having been told so 
much about it. 

His slight shoulders carry world re- 
nown. He is prepared to accept the 
unavoidable consequences thereof. And 
he waits with a certain shyness in his 
eyes, an obliging gesture, his voice soft. 
He has a courteous manner, a quiet 
style that envelops him and seems to 
create an atmosphere of fragility. 

Do you know the feeling that comes 
over you when you are sitting opposite 
somebody whose voice is much softer 
than your own, whose gestures have subt- 
ler movements, whose eyes look at the 
world with greater tenderness? At such 
a moment you cannot find your words 
because they all seem awkward and 
harsh—you can hardly take off your 
coat for fear of causing too much noise. 
You think: “Here I am, now I shall 
have to say something.” 

: And we begin with the important ques- 
tion if and where we shall have lunch. 
We laugh quite a lot and walk hurriedly 
trying to ignore the terrible emptiness. 
Suddenly we are sitting. We don’t know 
how to go on, the laugh disappears as 
powder can if it is dissolved. A void, 
I feel him thinking: “Go ahead”, and I 
myself think: “Now begin”, while I 
keep looking at his neat dark suit and 

is fine head and wonderful slim hands. 

€ start stuttering at the same time— 
we carry through. It commences. 


January, 1929 





I ask him about Negro Musical Art, 
Spirituals, blues, and mention great 
names of those I had the privilege of 
hearing and meeting in New York; 
Robeson, Johnson, Ethel Waters, etc. 
We come to the great point, the import- 
ant question: The new Negro. 

“You know one cannot say the New 
Negro is this or that. The New Negro 
is only just forming himself. If one 
were to write about him now, taking into 
account this enormous cultural move- 
ment as an ascertained fact, already one 
would be running ages ahead of time. 
People talk too much—more harm has 
been done by talking than anyone thinks. 

“Surely it is all great and very im- 
portant, only it is not the visible form 


: that is mightiest, that counts most. That 


is not finished and what has been done 
so far seems incomplete. Behold the 
thought, the idea of it—that truly is 
great. See how the Negro begins to 
rise up, trying to create a new world, 
choosing from his own and other peo- 
ple’s culture, kneeding it, forging it to- 
gether so as to come to a life which be 
worthy forever. 

“What has been achieved is a Har- 
lem which one finds in so many places in 
America. Admire it but see the values 
justly. Notice that the will is infinitely 
greater than the result. 

“Get the values rightly’—that is a 
sentence which is repeated often in all 
that he says. The reticence has dropped 
away and the gentle voice takes the vi- 
brating tone of his singing, the words 
come tenderly with hesitation and pauses 
so as to find the right accent,—again to 
give the right values. And to the inter- 
viewer the man changes—he is more than 
the expected pioneer for his race, for his 
art, because he does not speak directly 
of that race and that art, but one feels 
that he looks beyond to the force that 
makes race and art move and live to 
that which is everlasting, that always 
was and always will be. 

It is that which guides him—it has 
carried him through all the pain and 
hardship during his upward struggle in 
the world. It made him undertake the 
long way, beginning as a poor Negro boy 
in Georgia where his parents had been 
slaves,—leaving everything behind for 
the one aim he has in view and always 
seeing that dazzled by the unutterable 
glory of what he feels to be his vocation 
in life. All troubles, all sorrows have 
become kindness and tenderness, which 
shows itself in the gesture with which he 
puts aside all insignificant things, with 
which he describes himself only as an in- 
strument, a mediator, sure and true in 
his pure childlike modesty. 

He has sung for kings, for halls 
crowded with thousands and thousands 
and yet he says: “See the values rightly”. 
His biographer speaks of voices such as 








Jeanne of Domrémy heard. Roland 
Hayes heard voices and followed them,— 
what subtle irony!—for him the heavens 
opened while first hearing a gramophone 
as a little boy at his white employer’s 
house. ‘ 

“People always consider me a singer 
of Spirituals. That is not quite right. 
What moves me in the Spirituals also 
moves me in Schubert—not the fact 
that they were composed by Negroes, 
but that inspiration which fired the Ne- 
groes to create them just as Schubert 
was inspired—not the stove but the ‘fire 
inside of it. I only consider a furnace 
good if it turns into fire when it is 
burning.” 


Hayes visited Russia in February, a 
year ago, at the invitation of the 
Soviet Government. He gave five re- 
citals in Moscow, two in Leningrad, 
and single concerts in Kiev, Khar- 
kov and Rostov. The Pravda said of 
his first concert: 

As we have already written in our 
preliminary note, Roland Hayes’ debut 
in Moscow, organized by Rosphil—now 
the concert bureau of the academic the- 
atres—had to be the greatest event of 
the musical world of today, and truly it 
has proved itself the greatest. We have 
every reason to say that with the appear- 
ance of Hayes the Moscow public re- 
ceived a great number of artistic im- 
pressions which cannot be forgotten, and 
the Soviet vocal art has received an im- 
petus for its further development. We 
had before us a rare and marvellous 
artist of chamber music. 

Out of every song with its deeply 
musical mood was born a feeling of 
wonder reaching such a high point in 
technique that we can speak of it only 
with the highest praise. The voice of 
Hayes does not belong to the strong or 
brilliant type, his voice is rather soft- 
hued for a tenor, perhaps not even vivid 
for his highest notes. He is typically 
the lyric singer, lacking the strongly 
pathetic tones but capable at the same 
time of causing his hearers to experience 
just what he feels. Everything coarse 
or rude and affected is entirely strange 
to his artistical nature. The thoughtful 
and sweet Schubert or the mighty 
Brahms, the indisputably good Italian 
arias, the sad humor of the Negro hymns, 
he gives them all in such a way that 
every moment one forgets about the 
artist as interpreter who comes between 
the audience and the song. Further, 
Hayes’ program was based on such sharp 
contrasts as the Italian airs of the seven- 
teenth century and the Negro spirituals 
of today that the enchantment cast upon 
the public was complete. 

According to our opinion the talent 
of Hayes shows itself the deeper in the

THE BROWSING READER | 


In the Magazines 


“6 OUSCOUS and Sole Mar- 

guery” by Webb Waldron in 
the Living Age for November paints 
Morocco as the winter tourists’s para- 


dise. Fresh from a ducting, smart 
European hoiel, ir. Waldron thrusts 
us info a languorous, medieval setting, 


mysterious with shadowy passageways, 
and flecked with dim, veiled figures; 
into sunny Moorish gardens, lush with 
flower and fruit; into a Morocco of 
brown-legged water venders and half- 
naked children. Mr. Waldron says 
that at this moment, Morrocco is the 
same land that Leo the African saw 
four hundred years ago. 

Foreign Affairs for October carries 
the history of the struggle of “France 
and Italy in North Africa”, by C. A. 
Le Neuveu, from 1830, when France 
first seé out to conquer Algeria, down 
to the present, when there is still con- 
tention and bickering between France 
and Italy in Tunis and Morocco. It 
is a story, told without unseeming 
prejudice, of conquest, strategy, schem- 
ing, and exploitation. 

John Pepper in The Communist for 
October writes on “American Negro 
Problems”. Mr. Pepper says that 
now that a Negro proletariat is ap- 
pearing in the cities of the North and 
East, and that the agrarian South is 
being industrialized, the social condi- 
tion of the Negro race in America is 
changing. The Negro question in the 
United States must be treated with re- 
lation to the general international Ne- 
gro problem; for a strong Negro move- 
ment in America will influence and di- 
rect the Negro movement in all parts 
of the world where Negroes are op- 
pressed by various imperialistic powers. 
Mr. Pepper says that the American 
working class cannot free itself from 
capitalistic exploitation without free- 
ing Negroes from white oppression; 
therefore, the Negro problem emerges 
as an economic, rather than a racial 
problem. 

Charles W. Hackett offers “A Re- 
view of Our Policy in Nicaragua” in 
Current History for November. Mr. 
Hackett says that a survey of the re- 
lations between the United States and 
Nicaragua during the last twenty years 
is a story of inconsistencies and blund- 
ers. The sending of the Stimson Com- 
mission to Nicaragua in 1927 was an 
effort to extricate the United States 
government from the embarrassments

students of the election 


the Donkey. Frank R. Kent in Col- 
lier’s for October 20th asserted that 
both the Republicans and Democrats 
were “Afraid of the Dark’’ brothers. 
They were, he says, worried, and not a 
small part of the worry was caused by 
the uncertainty regarding the Negro 
vote. Both parties consciously disre- 
garded the Negro in presenting their 
respective platforms, and scoffed at the 
idea that there was any real trouble 
among the dark brethren; but, as Mr. 
Kent says, it is the undercurrents in 
politics that really count! 

And in the Nation for October 
17th, W. E. Burghardt Du Bois asked 
“Is Al Smith Afraid of the South?” 
and then proceeded to answer his ques- 
tion in the affirmative. Dr. Du Bois 
painted a picture of “Al” posing as a 
liberal, but, at the same time, assur- 
ing American capital that he was not 
its enemy. His program on liquor and 
religion stirred up so much trouble in 
the Smith camp that it was wise for the 
Democratic candidate to be orthodox 
on the Negro according to Southern 
traditions. Dr. Du Bois said that a 
vote for Smith was a vote for the re- 
actionary South which would not al- 
low Smith, even if he were so inclined, 
to take any liberal steps. 

The author of “Why We Behave 
Like Human Beings” has contributed 
a paper on “Race and Civilization 
Specialists” to Plain Talk for Novem- 
ber. Mr. Dorsey ridicules the use of 
intelligence tests and deals hard blows 
to advocates of race superiority. In 
part he says: “Such racial mixtures as 
we have in America today are in no 





oe 


essential different from race mixture 
which have been going on for thou. 
sands of years in Europe and Asia and 
which, we have no reason to believe. 
ever resulted in inferior races or in 
breaking up civilization.” He add 
that America does not take into ac. 
count the question as to how far un- 
desirable traits in the Negro popula- 
tion are innate and how far they are 
the result of the social surrounding: 
for which America alone is responsible 

The World Today for Septembe: 
offers “The Africa Nobody Knows” by 
Mary L. J. Akeley, who tells how he: 


husband has preserved in the Lukenia 


* Hills in Nairobi an “African Hall,” 


untouched by the hands of civilization. 
Mrs. Akeley writes of rose-hued Afri- 
can sunrises and sunsets, of green and 
leafy acacia trees fringing dusty river 
banks, of vast game herds roaming the 
hills and of a moon hung low in deep 
violet clouds—a glorious, virgin coun 
try, Africa! 

James Weldon Johnson, in discuss. 
ing “Race Prejudice and the Negro 
Artist” in Harper’s for November, says 
that the significance of the artistic ac- 
tivity of the Negro in America is two- 
fold: first, the Negro’s cultural con- 
tributions are bringing something fresh 
and vital to American art—an indigen- 
ous something which is warm and col- 
orful and real; and second, and of deep- 
er meaning, by his artistic efforts, the 
Negro is establishing himself as an in- 
telligent human being capable of citi- 
zenship. 

Without apology and without mak- 
ing special allowances for the Negro 
writer, Mr. Johnson, in the December 
American Mercury, tells of the “Dil- 
emma of the Negro Author”. Besides 
facing every one of the difficulties com- 
mon to all authors, the Aframerican 
faces the problem of a double and divi- 
ded audience—an audience with op- 
posite and often antagonistic points of 
view. Mr. Johnson says that he has 
thought that the Negro author “would 
be on surer ground and truer to him- 
self, if he could say to white America 
‘What I have written, I have written 
I hope you'll be interested and like it. 
If not, I can’t help it.’ But it .is impos- 
sible for a sane American Negro to 
write with total disregard for nine- 
tenths of the people of the United 
States.”’

4 PILGRIMAGE TO _ 8,000 
BLACK STUDENTS 


A. who sits in his chair and 
evolves the Negro problem from 
that which he has always known, is 
wrong from the start, easily led astray, 
and sure to give false information. I 
know Negro schools, for I have taught 
in them for some fifteen years in all, 
and I have visited them from the Dis- 
trict of Columbia to Texas, and from 
Oklahoma to Florida. But one or two 
recent mistakes: a forgetting that this 
school no longer exists, and that name 


stands for a new thing which 1 did 
not know gave me warning. So | 
started on a pilgrimage to the schools 
before my fall work was well arranged. 
I traveled three thousand miles and 
talked and listened in ten states, states 
where four or five million Negroes 
live. I feel now that I am prepared 
to talk with reasonable intelligence 
about Negro education for the next 
twelve months. 


CORBIE 


HE death of Eugene Corbie is a 

sad loss to the Negro race. He was 
a young black man from Trinidad whe 
made a brilliant record in American 
universities. He had a keen mind and 
was full of a youthful ardor for argu- 
ment and investigation which made 
some older people impatient. They can- 
not understand why Youth must see the 
thing through and know it and deems 
counterfeit all experience which is not 
its own. But Corbie had more than 
mere argument. He had faith and 
fearlessness, and if he had lived, he 
would have made his mark in this 
world. He is dead in his young man- 
hood and all the world is poorer for 
his going. 


CHARLOTTE MANYE 
REMEMBER Charlotte as a 


school girl when I was teaching at 
Wilberforce. She was a shy black 
girl, with a lovely voice, a fund of 
quiet humor, and a poise and manner 
that bespoke generations of breeding. 
She was a Basuto from South Africa 
and had come to Europe and the 
United States with a troop singing. 
Bishop Ransom moved to give her an 
education at Wilberforce, and the A. 
M. E. Church educated this girl and 
sent her as a missionary to the Trans- 
vaal. There, in Johannesburg, she has 
worked for twenty-seven years and 
done the finest piece of missionary work 
accomplished by the A. M. E. Church 
anywhere. 

But with all the credit that the 
Church richly deserves for training 
this woman, it is cruelly to blame. In 
a generation, she has not received a 
single leave of absence until this year. 
She came to General Conference this 
year, leaving a sick husband, who died 
in her absence, and a son. She has re- 


21 





ceived but little attention in the 
United States, and yet, she is perhaps 
the foremost native woman in South 
Africa. She has stood before two 
South African Premiers, Botha and 
Hertzog to plead for native women. 
She is at the head of a league of two 
thousand black women. She is Pro- 
bationary Officer in the Juvenile Court. 
She speaks English, Dutch and Basuto, 
and is trying to erect a refuge and 
rest room for girls and children. Quiet, 
refined, upright, and absolutely un- 
selfish, she has received in the last few 
years practically nothing from the 
Church Missionary funds. She goes 
back with nearly empty hands, save for 
gifts of goods and supplies furnished 
by friends; and to cap the climax, the 
Missionary Department of the A. M. 
E. Church is sending her back in the 
steerage all the way to Africa! Twenty- 
two days of travel,—nearly as many 
days as the years which she has given 
to the Church and its cause! She goes 
back grey-haired, stricken, poor but 
serene. 

Nor is this the fault of the Church, 
if we envisage the Church as thousands 
of poor earnest members, represented 
in hundreds of hardworking women’s 
groups raising money for mission work. 
But Somebody standing between the 
members and the missionaries has kept 
back or stolen the money which should 
go to support Charlotte Manye. 


SOCIAL REFORM 


AM coming to suspect that the first 

steps toward real and fundamental 
social reform in the United States and 
in European civilization, will begin 
with a few simple steps: some coun- 
tries and then all civilized countries, 
will begin to insist on complete and 
absolute publicity as to (a) the indi- 
vidual ownership of property; (b) in- 
dividual income; (c) individual pay- 
ment of taxes; (d) the cost and kind 
of goods raised and manufactured and 
their sales and selling price; (e) the 
kind and amount of work which each 
individual performs. 

It has become increasingly clear in 
discussions of social reform that on 
all these fundamental matters we have 
to depend on guess work. And yet, it 
is certain that without a large measure 
of accurate information with regard to 
income, expenditure, manufacture and 
sales, we cannot proceed to real re- 
form. We may guess, and guess rather 
accurately what the facts are. But we 
cannot really know. And we shall 
never know until public opinion comes 
to realize that private income and 
ownership is a fundamental and pri- 
mary matter on which there should be 
accurate public knowledge.

PRINCETON 


ROM year to year we have an- 

nounced that no Negro has ever 
received a degree from Princeton Uni- 
versity, except in the case of the Semi- 
nary, which is a distinct corporation. 
Recently it has been brought to our 
attention that in 1904 and 1906 two 
colored men, Dr. Leonard Z. Johnson, 
and the Reverend George S. Starks, 
received the degree of Master of Arts 
from Princeton University. 

Mr. Johnson writes us: 

“The degree of Master of Arts was 
not conferred ‘for resident work in the 
Seminary’. There was not then—nor 
is now—any organic relation between 
the Seminary and the University. 
Though at the time I was a candidate 
in the graduate department of the 
Seminary for the degree of Bachelor 
of Divinity, I registered separately in 
the Graduate School of the University 
for the Master’s degree, took all my 
courses, tests, and examinations in the 
halls and classes of the University, was 
listed in the University catalogue as a 
graduate student, and am listed in the 
general catalogue of Princeton gradu- 
ates as a Master of Arts. 

““At Commencement, 1904, I was 
in the academic procession and received 
my degree upon the platform of Alex- 
ander Hall at the hands of Woodrow 
Wilson, then president of the Univer- 
sity—his name in his own handwriting 
is on my diploma.” 


LEGAL DEFENSE 

ANY have doubtless read the 

N. A. A. C. P. release of Sep- 
tember 2Ist which itemized our ex- 
penditures for legal defense since 1912. 
From January Ist, 1912, to August 
3lst, 1928, the Association has spent 
$73,814.97 in cash, not computing the 
attorney's fees that have been donated 
to the cause by great lawyers. Cases 
have cost all the way from $9.00 to 
$14,942 in the Arkansas Peonage Case, 
and $37,849 in the Sweet Case. In 
addition to this, branches of the N. A. 
A. C. P. have raised and expended 
large additional funds in co-operation 
with the National Office. At least 
$100,000 and possibly $125,000 has 
thus been spent to defend the Negro in 
the courts during the last sixteen 
years. And this all is but a drop in 
the bucket. We could easily have ex- 
pended a million dollars in these years, 
and still have been unable to take up 
just cases and defend unfortunate 
people. 

As it is, our usual answer to appeals 
for aid must be: What have you done 
to defend yourself? What can your 
friends do? Cannot the local branch 
of the N. A. A. C. P. take up the mat- 
ter? 

This move is absolutely necessary 


to test the sincerity and importance of 
the case and the willingness of those in- 
terested to work hard and make sacyj- 
fice. 

Secondly, we investigate the case and 
look into the circumstances to see what 
kind of a difficulty is laid before ys, 
If it is simply a matter of human mis- 
fortune or wrong, where the color and 
race of the individual who has suf- 
fered has little to do with the matter, 
we must in most cases pass it by. It 
would be a splendid thing if we did 
have funds to help redress wrongs in 
thousands of such cases that come to 
our notice, but we have not and more- 
over, that sort of thing is not our pri- 
mary duty. 

If the difficulty lies mainly because 
of racial prejudices, then the question 
is: Can a proper case be made out from 
the known facts? 


WANTED—A HUSBAND 
ONTRARY to the belief of most 


of our Southern white friends, we 
are not at all anxious for the inter- 
marriage of the races. We have no 
valid reasons, either biological or 
esthetic, to offer in support of this un- 
fortunate prejudice on our part. Never- 
theless, other things being equal, (and 
we admit they seldom are equal) we 
prefer to have most of our colored 
friends marry colored people. But, 
being broad-minded, we feel duty- 
bound to inform our readers that we 
have a letter from “a charming white 
lady” who lives in Yugo-Slavia. She 
states that she wishes “to marry a col- 
oured man; he must be intelligent, 
distinguished, handsome and good sit- 
uated, who are able to offer a hearty 
and careless life to her. Only the 
serious letter will be answered”. 

The name and the address of this 
lonesome white damsel we are keep- 
ing on file and we shall be glad to 
furnish an extra force of clerks if ne- 
cessary to handle the resultant corre- 
spondence. Frankly our object is par- 
tially selfish, for we expect in this way 
to prove or disprove the overwhelm- 
ing desire of American colored men 
to obtain white wives—especially of 
those black gentlemen who are “able 
to offer a hearty and careless life” toa 
love-lorn blonde. Let the band play

Miracle of Kings 
Continued from page 8) 
and kind 


Negro, king were 
above all things. 

“If you wish, dear sirs, | will show 
you the road to the village, for my 
home is right on the outskirts.” 

The black king asked her, with his 
very sweet voice, “And you, little one, 
what are you doing here?” 

“Well, I,” said the little girl, all 
disturbed, “I had to come for water to 
the fountain in the woods. My step- 
mother sent me; but the fountain in 
the woods was frozen and I could not 
fll my pitcher.” 

“What! your step-mother sends you 
tor water in these unearthly hours?” 

“Yes, dear sirs. She is a bad step- 
mother who loves me not at all and 
beats me.” 

The three kings felt pity quickly 
welling up in their hearts, especially the 
Negro king. 

“All right, little girl, come up with 
us.” And the Negro king, sweetest 
Melchior, helped her mount on his 
camel. The little girl was enchanted 
with joy, but her eyes drifted in the 
jirection of the toys. 


sweet 
































IGHING, she thought, “My step- 
mother has surely not placed my 
little shoes on the window.” 

But soon, when the lighted windows 
of the houses came into sight, the daz- 
zling cortege vanished in the azure 
air, and the little girl felt like those 
who awake from a dream, with an 
ineffably sweet freshness on her eye- 
lids, and she said, “It was all a dream,” 
and without much ado, she went to 
lift the jug. But looking down at her 
hands, she found them all covered with 
roses, and she saw at her side the 
pitcher filled with sweet and soft 
water like that which gushes in the 
springs of the South that never freeze 
and are always gurgling. And, as- 
tounded and filled with happiness, she 
saw in the distance the land all dry 
and in bloom, just as if the sweetness 
of the eyes of the Negro king, who saw 
her in her dreams, had put into bloom 
her life amidst a Southern spring: and 
the majesty of her splendid dream 
should still persist in her wonderful 
awakening.

January, 1929 





gar mill on the point had been laid 
low and all of the workmen’s little 
houses on the street and near it were 
in ruins, clothes and bedding were 
spread out everywhere to dry under a 
sky still lowering, and the poor people 
looked miserable and forlorn. At the 
consulate I found Mr. Hunt standing 
at his post doing his duty and helping 
others, though he was drawn and pale. 
He said he’d never forget the day and 
night of terror he’d passed through. 
Nearly all of our furniture was ruined, 
water stood all over in the house, 
clothing and bedding were out drying 
and there was more rain every day. 
But we could only be too thankful 
that our lives were spared and feel 
that more than many others we have 
been blessed in every way. 


S the roof was still off and rain 

threatening, etc., it was finally 
decided that I’d better return to our 
country house for a few days, and that 
decision nearly cost me my life, for, 
on crossing the Riviére Salée with my 
friends we came near being drowned. 
After making way for other boats we 
were borne by the current too near a 
rope which had been placed across the 
channel, and our not too skillful oars- 
men could not avoid it so it caught us 
and nearly overturned the boat, knock- 
ing a boatman and our chauffeur into 
the water. They caught on to the 
side of the boat but did not overturn 
it fortunately. By ducking our heads 
we avoided the cable, though it touched 
my friend and almost knocked her 
overboard. We were now nearing a 
foundation of masonry supporting a 
huge water conduit which crosses the 
channel. We were obliged to leave 
the boat and, thanks to the presence 
of mind and aid of my friend’s hus- 
band and the chauffeur, we were soon 
hoisted up onto the masonry and walk- 
ing for the other side of the river in 
a heavy shower which drenched us to 
the bone. After finding our auto 
among the numerous others, we were 
soon en route for Trois Riviéres and 
Basse Terre and the sun soon came 
out to warm and dry us somewhat. 
Though fearful of grippe or pneu- 
monia to follow, I escaped with a 
slight cold and nervous reaction, as I 
took something hot and went at once 
to bed. In a week’s time, I was again 
at the Pointe trying to gather up the 
scattered ends and nurse my husband 
who was ill with grippe and fever. 
There two other frights awaited me, 
a terrible electrical storm with the 
loudest peals of thunder I’ve ever 
heard, and a cry of fire in the night 
with the tocsin sounding the alarm, 
and one or two slight earthquake 
shocks were added for good measure.

T first the people seemed struck 

dumb and then they took things 
philosophically, or perhaps, I’d better 
say stoically, and went about their 
business gathering up slowly the scat- 
tered fragments. And the sad part 
about it all was that, isolated as we are 
and with all means of communica- 
tion cut Off, the outside world was ig- 
norant of our fate for days and days. 
After six days the American consul 
could send out an S. O. S. call to the 
government for aid and comfort, just 
after Paris had been reached. The 
first boat to arrive left France Septem- 
ber 23rd and landed here October 7th 
with food and hospital supplies at the 
same time that a war vessel came in 
having on board Ambassador Claudel 
as special commissioner of the French 
government. 

Meanwhile the Governor and 
Mayors had been doing what they 
could. At Pointe-a-Pitre, the Mayor 
and assistants acted with considerable 
dispatch in clearing the streets, caring 
for the sick and wounded, distributing 
food tickets, etc. Shelter was a more 
dificult matter, though one doesn’t 
need much in this climate during good 
weather—and frequent rains drenched 
all of the homeless and roofless until 
colds and grippe and pneumonia were 
prevalent. Corrugated iron is lacking 
and one can only wait. More material 
and some expert road builders are en 
route from France, it is said. 

It will be years before the colony 
will assume a modern aspect or even 
its former aspect, and it was already 
fifty years behind modern progress. 
The roads need widening and shorten- 
ing, in order to avoid many dangerous 
and unnecessary curves and windings. 
General and industrial training lag 
sixty years behind the times. Even 
the pictures in the primers portray 
costumes of forty vears ago. Politics, 
too, and petty racial prejudices keep 
the people divided. 

Vegetation pushes so rapidly here 
that Nature is already repairing some 
of her past ravage and the landscape 
looks less desolate and forlorn. The 
mountain heights still show parched 
and yellow, but banana trees are lift- 
ing their heads, the sugar cane right- 
ing itself, and the other trees left 
standing are sprouting out their myriad 
shades of green from maimed and 
broken branches, and here and there a 
flower blooms again. To look at the 
blue sea and spotless sky today and 
feel the warm caress of the wind, one 
would almost be inclined to say this 
is, in truth, a “paradise terreste’, an 
“emerald isle’, but when the wind 
rises and the earth trembles one longs 
for the “wings of a dove to fly far 
far away” from this pays d’epouvante. 


Sunshine Sammy 
(Continued from page \() 


in one of the smaller theaters to an 
audience more or less critical, his party 
journeyed to the Texas city. Imagine 
their surprise when they received 3 
rousing greeting at the station and all 
along the route of the gala parade in. 
cluding fourteen automobiles crowded 
with enthusiastic admirers. The orig. 
inal engagement, which was for three 
days, netted the team $450. The act 
went over in such fine style that the 
engagement was extended to cover a 
period of twelve days at an advanced 
figure. 


This excellent beginning was fol- 
lowed by engagements in New Or. 
leans, Birmingham and Atlanta. In 
the Georgia capitol Sunshine Samm 
was a guest of the Chamber of Com. 
merce and appeared in a Loew’s the. 
ater, the first Negro act in thirty-five 
years. The Atlanta Constitution, an 
outstanding southern daily, was most 
generous in praise of the star. The act 
at this time was bringing seven hun- 
dred and fifty dollars a week. The 
publicity given by the Constitution 
helped to make easy lucrative engage- 
ments in Nashville, Louisville, Chi- 
cago, Detroit and Cleveland. The 
Billboard joined the chorus in singing 
the praises of the now famous vaude- 
ville star and the theatrical world was 
alert enough to get on the band wagon. 


R. A. FEINBERG, well known 

booking agent in New York 
City, was attracted by this extraordin- 
ary publicity and made special efforts 
to secure the booking rights of the new 
star. Consequently after a series of 
telegrams, long distance telephone calls 
and letters, a contract was secured 
with Fay’s Circuit handled through 
Keith’s Agency and the act opened at 
Fay’s Rochester Theater in*May, 1925, 
at a salary of $1250 a week. Then 
followed successful engagements 
throughout the East and Middle West. 
In the fall of 1925 the act was booked 
by the Keith-Albee Orpheum Circuit. 
For the three years ending May, 1928, 
these contracts were in force. In May 
of this year a contract was signed with 
Loew’s Circuit which will include the 
season of 1928-9. On the Orpheum 
and on the Loew’s Circuit despite the 
other nationally known acts carried, 
Sunshine Sammy’s act has always been 
featured as the head-liner on the bill. 
Contracts for this year include engage 


ments for the Vitaphone talking pit: 
tures. 


Thus we follow an interesting ascent 
from a dollar and a half a week to 
twelve hundred and fifty a week and 
more. Obviously this modest, capable

At present writing quartermaster 
Licorish is to receive a fund of $714, 
raised by Mr. Straus and through the 
New York Times. Besides that, he is 
appearing before crowded audiences in 
a number of the largest vaudeville 
houses of New York. So that in most 
gratifying fashion, the bravery and in- 
telligence of this modest man of the 
sea, hailing from Barbadoes is redound- 
ing not alone to his own advantage but 
to that of his race. 

4 PROTEST AT SEGREGATION 
N October 23, the following let- 
ter was sent to the United States 
Secretary of the Interior: 

“My dear Mr. Secretary: I hereby 
tender my resignation as senior stenog- 
rapher in the General Land Office, to 
take effect at the close of service Oc- 
tober 24, 1928, as a protest against the 
crushing conditions to which the col- 
ored employees are subjected in this de- 
partment and in the Government, and 
in order that I may enter upon higher 
and fuller service to my country and 
to my race.” 

The letter was sent by Miss Gret- 
chen McRae, one of the leaders in the 
fight against discrimination practiced 
on colored clerks of the Washington 
government bureaus in offices and cafe- 
terias, as well as in employment and 
Promotion. Miss McRae was out- 
spoken in her criticism of the Jim-Crow 
policy in government departments, dur- 
ing her employment there. She not 
only voiced her own criticism, but en- 
couraged other clerks to do likewise 
and to sign petitions denouncing the 
Practice, The change in attitude 


January, 1929 


which must precede decent fairness to 
all government employees irrespective 
of race or color is slow in coming. But 
Miss McRae’s work surely has helped 
to focus public opinion on the vicious 
segregation practices ; and by that token 
we must hope she has helped to hasten 
the day when these practices will be 
ended.

de earth. 


“’*Cause dat he remembered not to show 
mercy, 

But clothed himself with cursin’ as with 
a gaarment; 

An’ it came into his inwaards paarts lak 
waater, 

An’ lak oil into his bones. 


“Dis is de rewaard of our adversary 
from de Lord, 

Of him dat speak evil agains’ our souls. 

Save us from him dat judge our souls. 

Save us Lord from him. 


“O God of our praise, Amen! 


Amen!” 


Te cursers paused for a moment in 
silence, 
Then howled their curse again 

In dreadful repetition through the night, 
True black Obeah-taught men. 


Until the end came with the morning, 
When some fell on the ground; 
Their voices rolling up, up, up 
Into a breaking sound. 


Black eyes were twitching horribly; 
Black mouths were slavering froth 
Like mad dogs snarling among them- 
selves, 
Each with the other wroth. 


Growing ever weaker Lance prayed and 
struggled 
With the ghostly hands of death, 
When sharp through his brain shot an 
inspiration 


So daring he held his breath. 


Most surely God had given him a 
weapon, 
It made his slow pulse throb.

He stretched as he could and raised on 
his toes 
And smiled at the maddened mob. 


His hooked eagle-beak stuck out dilated; 
His eyes were eyes of fire; 

His mouth a line of indomitable strength; 
He appeared to tower higher. 


A tall, gaunt fisherman’s grave look 
caught 
The flame in Lance’s eyes; 
In the voice of one seeing miracles 
He yelped in fear-hoarse cries: 


“Christ Jesus Almighty, have mercy on 
us, 
De wraath of God is dere 
Staamped full on dat maan, dat Jamai- 
can’s face, 


All hell is broke loose here.” 


The mob and its fiendish black leader 
Were shivering and unnerved, 

Lance was neither crazy nor dead. 
Their shaken allegiance swerved. 


As Lance drew a deep, long quivering 
breath, 
Heedless of biting ropes, 
Heedless of tearing mortal flesh, 
His deathless spirit hopes ;— 


Slowly he uttered in lyrical tones: 


“De Lord is my shepherd; 


I shall not waant. 


“Yea, though I waalk through de valley 
of de shadow of death. 

I will fear no evil; 

For Thou is with I; 

Thy rod an’ Thy staaff dey comforts I. 


“Thou prepares’ a taable for I 
Ir de presence of mine enemies; 
Thou anoints my head with oil: 
My cup runneth over 


“Surely goodness an’ mercy shall follow I 
All de days of my life 
An’ I shall dwell in de house of de Lord 


” 
forever. 


ANCE held the men in awe struck 
silence 
Till their leader screamed his wrath: 
“Death an’ God’s curse to dat Jamai- 
can!” 
And sweeping men from his path 


He sprang at Lance to slash his throat 
When the God-fearing fisherman 
cried: 
“Damn yo’, yo’ devil, stop it! Stop it!” 
And clamped Scraggs’ arms to his side. 


Lance’s golden 
umphant: 
“My Psalm is won! Is won! 
Glory! Glory to God in de highes’! 
Lord Jesus will is done!”

Negro hymns. With his complete mas- 
tery of artistic expression unfolded to us 





such a world of pain united with utte; 
child-like faith in a better future, that 
through those hymns we were brought 
to the active co-experience of the tragedy 
of these people—the tragedy of an ex. 
ploited race. We greet the famous singer 
and the great artist of sounds, who 
brings with him a stream of great ar 
which he has mastered under the cop. 
dition of hard struggle. For the singer, 
who knows the languages of Europe, 
English, Italian, German, and French 
equally well; who gives remarkably wel] 
the musical essence of different national 
schools of music—has made a tre. 
mendous cultural achievement. There js 
much to learn from him for our Soviet 
singers. The accompanist of Hayes is a 
fellow countryman, the author of the 
collected hymns and the adapter, ., . 
Richard Parham is a fine and musical 
accompanist.” 


Of his singing in Berlin, the Signal 
say 


wn 


It is not necessary to appraise Mr, 
Roland Hayes as the world famous Ne- 
gro tenor on the program, for un- 
doubtedly he would have made an ever- 
lasting impression through the medium of 
his art upon an understanding public. 
Only a delicate, sensitive, and a fine 
singer and a musician of eminence could 
have lived so deeply in the inner concep- 
tion of the German songs, a thing which 
foreign singers seldom do. His smooth, 
well built tenor is of overwhelming 
beauty in the pianissimo, although in the 
fortissimo some difficulties betray them- 
selves through pressure of tones, occa- 
sional forcing and the use of the nose 
resonance. ‘Therefore his field is some- 
what limited, but he is a singer of 
finesse for connoisseurs. Another Negro, 
Percy Parham, accompanied him intelli- 
gently, skillfully” 


Turning now from Roland Hayes to 
Walter White, we note that a Rus- 
sian translation of “Flight” has been 
made. It is accompanied by a preface 
written by Carl Jones. He says: 


Many of them who find that their 
open allegiance with Negroes places the 
penalty imposed on those born black in 
America upon them, renounce this ad- 
herence when impelled by economic pres- 
sure to seek employment and when the 
labor of the day is completed return at 
night to the warmer and more enlivening 
embraces of Negro society. Some marry 
into white families and are completely 
submerged. Many who have done this 
find their dissociation from Negroes to 
be too great a price and voluntarily 
return to the dark race. They even 
speak of this as coming back to their 
own people. 

It is not difficult to understand the 
discontent of the Negroes who _ have 
“passed over” into white society and be- 
come successful in business. The warmth 
and color of Negro life, though clouded 
by the bar sinister—color—is proverbial. 
On the other hand the average white 
worker in America seems to be a cap- 
tive of the machine. His working hours 
finds him hopelessly fastened and as he 
often believes unescapably fastened to 


Tne Crisis 


the machine. His leisure hours find him 
unable to relieve himself from the de- 
pression created by the pessimistic atti- 
tude he has taken of life. Their faces 
reflect this pessimism and hopelessness. 
Their moments of relaxation are spent 
watching a baseball game or a boxing 
match. In the South such moments are 
spent in attendance of some revival meet- 
ing or in participation in some such 
Roman holiday as a _ lynching bee 
affords. .. - 

The Negro has given America the 
only folk music of which she can boast. 
He stands as the undisputed creator of 
America’s now famous dances and dance 
music. Life he must have, song and 
laughter he radiates. Herein lies the 
answer to the question why those among 
the “near-whites” who can “pass over” 
prefer to remain at least socially within 
the “Pale”. 

All this Mr. White has caught up and 
woven into a fabric from which he has 
cut the glamorous, scintillating and ex- 
tremely colorful “Flight”. 


HARLEM 
CERTAIN J. W. T. Mason 


writing in the Sunday Express 
of London, Eng., gives some extraor- 
dinary “facts” about Harlem. We 
quote a few: 


The blacks are as isolated in New 
York as if they dwelt in Africa. Their 
principal residential district is in Har- 
lem, on Manhattan Island, with 135th- 
street forming their chief thoroughfare. 
Nearly two hundred thousand Negroes 
now live in the Harlem area, which a 
generation ago was as fashionable a 
white residential section as South Ken- 
sington in London. 

There are no whites in this Negro 
quarter, except curious visitors who go 
there in numbers to see the sights. Ne- 
gro policemen patrol the streets, Negro 
postmen deliver letters, Negro cinemas 
offer amusement, there are several the- 
atres where the performers are all blacks, 
Negro restaurants abound, and Negro 
Newspapers print nothing but Negro 
news. 

Hidden in the recesses of the houses 
are occasional voodoo doctors and Negro 
witches, who profess to cure illnesses and 
be able to concoct love charms. The old 
jungle lure still dwells in many Negro 
breasts. 

Schools offer as complete an education 
to the New York Negroes as to white 
children, but the blacks have not an in- 
herited mental capacity giving promise 
of any large prosperity for them in the 
near future. The small shops in the 
Negro sections, bake shops, meat shops, 
grocery shops, clothing shops and the 
like, are all operated by whites, because 
the Negroes are not competent even to 
engage in the smallest retail trade re- 
quiring book-keeping and a moderate 
Capacity to meet the simple problems of 
small business. Negro purchasers would 
like to give preference to shopkeepers of 
their own race, but they cannot do so 
ecause there are practically none. 

Negro associations for improving their 
conditions are not lacking, but leadership 


January, 19269 


is woefully inept. The Negroes have a 
low sense of financial responsibilities, and 
banks are reluctant to loan them large 
sums for business development. 


Small wonder that Europeans get an 
extraordinary idea of the American 
Negro. 


BRITISH COLONIAL ADMIN- 
ISTRATION 


HE Hon. C. C. Adeniyi-Jones, 

member of the Nigerian Legisla- 
tive Council has been speaking plainly 
in West Africa concerning political 
and administrative problems in Ni- 
geria. 

There can be no doubt that to Sir 
Hugh Clifford must be awarded the 
honor of being the first West African 
Governor to introduce the principle of 
the franchise into British Africa, by in- 
corporating the privilege into the Con- 
stitution of the Legislative Council of 
the Colony in 1923. 

Though the activities of the National 
Congress of West Africa had, since 1920, 
succeeded in creating a favorable atmos- 
phere for the introduction of franchise 
into British West Africa, and everybody 
was on the tiptoe of expectation that the 
Gold Coast Colony would naturally take 
the lead, it was left to Sir Hugh’s ini- 
tiative as Governor of Nigeria to give 
concrete expression to that idealism 
which had tinged the imagination of the 
Congress leaders. 

The Nigerian Constitution, though 
first in the field, has, I regret to say, 
proved the least satisfactory, because of 
its many grave defects when compared 
with those of the sister Colonies. 

In the first place its overwhelming 
official majority, which, originally nine, 
has by recent Letters Patent been in- 
creased to 12, has not only nullified the 
principle of the franchise but has practi- 
cally reduced the unofficial members, 
especially the elected members, to the 
role of mere recording instruments of 
oficial sweet will. 


It will be remembered that the neces- 
sity for the control of the Colony’s ex- 
penditute constituted the “point of at- 
tack” of the criticism levelled against the 
Nigerian Constitution in its incipiency, 
when the cry for a “Geddes axe” on an 
“Inchcape Commission” was raised by 
the elected members. It will also be re- 
membered that that cry was so loud 
that it made itself heard and brought 
from Sir Hugh the categorical reply that 
the control of expenditure would be 
vested in the hands of his unofficial mem- 
bers. Unfortunately the principle behind 
that reply seems to have been existing 
more on paper and in the platitudinous 
phrases with which the idea was clothed 
than in the practical working of the 
scheme; for, de facto, in each Finance 
committee since the present administra- 
tion, unofficial members, when raising a 
protest against any particular item listed 
in the estimates of expenditures, are in- 
variably met with the staid reply either 
that the Secretary of State for the Col- 
onies has already sanctioned the ex- 
penditure, or the experts of the Depart-

ment that is to incur the expenditure had 
gone thoroughly into the matter with the 
head of the Executive before the item 
was booked. And if by any means any 
particular item be ruled out by the activ- 
ities of the unofficial members in the 
Finance Committee, that item invariably 
finds it way back into the Estimates, 
either by an official motion when “Coun- 
cil resumes,” or in a subsequent supple- 
mentary estimate. And, of course, this 
latter means that the expenditure has 
been actually incurred before the item 
is brought to a subsequent meeting of 
Council for “discussion.” 

Indeed, so great has been the despair 
of unofficial members that they have long 
ago considered it a sheer waste of their 
valuable time to be called upon to sit as 
member of a Finance Committee where 
everything has been previously cut and 
dried, the duty expected from them being 
simply to initial or tick off the items as 
they are called out. And it was with a 
view to dispel the dissatisfaction en- 
gendered amongst unofficial members, as 
the result of the suspicion that their 
opinion and views do not count with the 
Government, that Sir Graeme Thomson 
convened a round table conference of 
uofficial members early last year. 


RED CAPS 
HE New York Times says: 

The honesty of the “Red Cap” 
porters in the metropolitan railroad sta- 
tions is constantly being tested and seldom 
found wanting. An hour spent in the Lost 
Property room of any station will prove 
this by the large number of varied ar- 
ticles returned. Among the returned 
goods are wallets loaded with money; 
canes, umbrellas, spectacle cases, port- 
folios, handbags, gloves, wraps, golf 
bags, lunch baskets, books, jewelry and 
bouquets of flowers. 

Scenes of pathos and humor take place 
in the Lost Property room. A man re- 
ports that in rushing across the waiting 
room floor he lost his wife’s picture, and 
he never traveled without it. “It is my 
mascot,” he explains, “and I am super- 
stitious about it.” A drawer in the 
desk is opened and the fading picture of 
a woman, taken evidently thirty years 
ago, is taken out. “A Red Cap found 
it,” is the report. 

Sometimes the Red Caps are the losers. 
One comes into the room loaded down 
with valises and suitcases. “I’ve lost 
my man,” he reports. “I was carrying 
all these for him, stooped to fix the strap 
on a suitcase and when I looked up he 
had gone.” 


MR. GARVEY EXPLAINS 
ARCUS GARVEY has been 


speaking and holding interviews 
in London, Paris, and Geneva. Re- 
ports of some of his speeches have come 
to us from various sources. The Gold 
Coast Independent of British West 
Africa reports one speech which we 
have not seen before, from which we 
quote without comment. 


In addition to the fact that for six 
years 25 per cent, of our employees were 





secret service agents of che United States 
Government, it is peculiar also for you 
to realize that the Counsel-General to 
me and to my Organization, on whose 
advice I acted—I not being an American 
citizen but a British subject, not know- 
ing the American laws—the Counse]- 
General of our Organization and to me 
paid, like myself, from the common 
funds of the Organization, an American 
citizen who was responsible for the legal 
phase of our business—while he was in 
our employ he was also in the employ 
of the Government. When I was ir- 
dicted by the Government they called 
him out from serving us as Counsel- 
General, and, after convicting me, they 
made him Assistant Attorney-General of 
the United States. If anybody should 
have been indicted the Counsel of the 
Organization who gave the advice to the 
Organization, should have been indicted. 
They did not indict him, however; they 
indicted the President who acted on the 
Counsel-General’s advice; and after the 
President was convicted they honored 
the Counsel by making him Assistant 
Attorney-General of the United States, 
Those are the morals of politics in 
America. 

And I am surprised that the English 
Press should influence the English public 
to condemn me without a hearing, trying 
to state that I am a criminal and an 
ex-convict, under those circumstances. 


THE NULLIFIED AMEND. 
MENT 


E quote an editorial in the Chi- 
cago daily Tribune which is of 
wide significance at this time: 


The nullification of the fourteenth 
amendment in congress has given the 
United States a form or representative 
government for which the constitution 
does not provide. It also gives the nation 
a manner of electing a President for 
which the constitution does not provide. 
It is not a question of whether southern 
states have found legal ways of keeping 
Negro citizens from voting and thus 
preserving the white control of govern- 
ment. 

It is recognized that some states may 
have and will have franchise restrictions. 
A person may be an American citizen and 
not a qualified voter in an American 
state. But if such persons are twenty- 
one years of age, are citizens and cannot 
qualify as voters they cannot be counted 
in the population of the state for pur- 
poses of representation either in congress 
or in the electoral college. If they 
cannot vote because they are unwilling 
or unable to pay a poll tax, because they 
cannot read or write or interpret a part 
of the constitution the state which re- 
quires such qualifications for voting is 
to have the number of these nonvoting 
citizens deducted from the total on which 
its representation is based. 

The right to impose a qualifying test 
is recognized but it carries what may be 
called a penalty. It is not in reality 
that. It is an adjustment or compensa- 
tion. The state which has free and un- 
abridged voting rights available to all 
citizens of legal age is intended to have

all its population, exclusive of untaxed 
Indians, counted as the basis of its rep- 
resentation in congress and in the elec- 
tion of President. A state which dis- 
qualifies some of its citizens cancels them 
out, under the constitution. a 

There is much passion and prejudice 
in the issue because the amendment was 
intended primarily to give the Negro 
freedmen the franchise and because the 
attempts of the radical Republicans to 
coerce the south after the civil war pro- 
moted as much bitterness as the war it- 
self. The supporters of suffrage restric- 
tions say that all have been made effec- 
tive legally. If that is to be conceded it 
remains that the legal adjustment in rep- 
resentation has not been made and it has 
not been made because the members of 
congress do not obey the command of the 
constitution. 

The restrictions are not all in southern 
states, but there are the conspicuous is- 
sues. If the southern states have the 
election laws they want and find neces- 
sary the attainment of their object re- 
quires them to give up a certain voting 
strength in the making of federal laws 
and in the election of a President. Arthur 
Henning in his articles dealing with this 
subject points out that Hughes and not 
Wilson would have been elected if the 
electoral college had been properly con- 
stituted. The person who thinks that 
this nullification of the constitution is a 
matter of no importance hasn’t much 
regard for the working of his form of 
government. If it is of so little con- 
sequence there is nothing to prevent other 
holes being shot in it. 

The fourteenth amendment has not 

been repealed. It does not require ma- 
chinery of enforcement. A little work 
by the census bureau would give con- 
gress the figures and thereupon the ad- 
justment of representation to suffrage 
laws becomes automatic. All congress 
need do, and that it is commanded to do, 
is to pass an apportionment bill comply- 
ing with the constitution and recognizing 
the facts. 
_ This question will not quiet itself. It 
is presented to congress. Submit that 
amendment for repeal or obey it. If the 
people no longer want their government 
organized in that fashion and their laws 
passed under such a system of repre- 
sentative government they'll vote it out 
of the constitution. It is not dead wood 
in the body of organic law, although 
congress seems so to regard it. It is a 
most important part of the American 
system of representative democracy and 
of the republican form of government. 





OVER-CROW DING 


IRARD writes in his “Talk of 
the Day” in the Philadelphia 
Enquirer: 
Every twelfth person you see in Phila- 
delphia is a Negro. 
In the past decade colored population 


as increased three times as fast as white 
population. 


Another important fact is that four 
— as many Negroes as white people 
ve upon an acre of ground in this city. 


January, 1929 





This gross over-crowding ot our 170,000 
Negro population comes as near a real 
scandal as anything you can find in this 
otherwise enlightened town. 


Goodness knows how many agencies 
in the past ten years have wrung your 
hearts and your pocketbooks in behalf 
of “Near East sufferers.” I do not know 
what makes the Near East so habitually 
bleed, but bleed it does. 


Millions of money have gone from this 
State to do one thing or another in the 
Near East. I learn from one small 
church in the little town of Emporium 
that its Near East tax is $100 a year. 


So we bleed cash for a cause 5000 
miles away, but I know of no big at- 
tempt made in Philadelphia to cure this 
Negro scandal at our own door. 

Any populated part of a big city seems 
croweded aplenty. 

But the white folks have more elbow 
room, more breathing spaces and more 
square feet per home by great odds than 
have our 170,000 colored people. 

Our white population upon one acre is 
only twenty-eight. Our Negro population 


upon one acre is 111—about four times 
as crowded. 


Now if Negro homes were towering 
apartments, an acre might easily hold 
111 comfortably. Negro homes, on the 
contrary, are nearly all two-story, or at 
most, small three-story dwellings. 


And in that fact it will be found that 
while Negro inhabitants huddle four 
times as thickly upon one acre as do 
white inhabitants, the crowding is really 
far worse than that. 

Thousands of white inhabitants dwell 
in tall apartments and a tall apartment 
multiplies populated acreage with every 
floor. 

What can Philadelphia do to remedy 
this worst of city evils—the overcrowd- 
ing of Negroes in restricted areas? Well, 
we Can go on investing scores of millions 
a year of our own cash in foreign indus- 
tries and neglect, as in the past, to invest 
even one million for the home betterment 
of 170,000 of our own industrial popula- 
tion. 

Yet one might suppose it would profit 
us more to help our own toilers than to 
aid industry in Patagonia. 


THE WORKING DAUGHTERS 


FRIEND writes us concerning 
that well-known passage in the 
Bible: “I Am Black But Comely, O 


—Daughters of Jerusalem”. 


How many times has this famous 
passage from the Song of Songs been 
quoted by colored folk, and how few 
have ever looked into its history or its 
true meaning. Dean Pickens, in one of 
his speeches, has asserted that the “but” 
in the sentence has been put there by 
the race prejudice of the modern Nordic; 
in the original Hebrew, he says, it is 
“black and comely.” ‘This is an amus- 
ing quip, but if intended seriously, it 
has not a leg to stand on. For what- 
ever the original Hebrew may be, the 
“but” was put there before any of the

Nordic races could read or write. [p 
the Latin version. of the Bible made by 
St. Jerome at the end of the fourth 
century A. D., which is known as the 
Vulgate and has been used by the Cath. 
olic Church ever since, the words are 
given as “nigra sum sed formosa”—and 
all of us know enough Latin to know 
that “sed” is “but”. I do not happen 
to have the Septuagint Greek version of 
the Bible at hand, but this translation, 
which was made by the Hellenized Jews 
of Egypt nearly three centuries before 
the birth of Christ, also shows, as ] 
remember, that the phrase was then 
understood to mean “black (or swarthy) 
but beautiful’. Not only that, but 
several times the fairness of complexion 
of the person beloved is insisted on, as a 
distinct virtue, in the Song of Songs. 

But that is not the only difficulty to 
be considered. Was the lady black at 
all, that is, in the sense of being a mem- 
ber of a Negro race? I doubt it. Many 
of the most competent Hebrew scholars 
translate the word, not “black”, but 
“swarthy”. So the late Professor Morris 
Jastrow, Jr., in his book, The Song of 
Songs: A New Translation based ona 
Revised Text (Philadelphia, 1921), 
translates: “Swarthy am, but comely, 
O maidens of Jerusalem, (swarthy) as 
the tents of Kedar, as Solomonic hang- 
ings. Heed not that I am_ swarthy, 
that the sun has scorched me; the keeper 
of the vineyards they made me; but my 
own vineyard I did not keep.” And ina 
note he explains the word, “the keeper 
of the vineyards they made me,” by say- 
ing: “That is the reason why she is 
sunburnt; the reference is to the guard- 
ing of the vineyards during harvest 
time.” In other words, the poor girl of 
the country, who has to stand in the 
sun guarding the vineyards, excuses her 
sunburnt skin to the sheltered “daughters 
of Jerusalem” who have the paleness of 
those who guard themselves against the 
sun. It is another illustration of Veb- 
len’s “theory of the leisure class”: pale 
skins were preferred because it showed 
you did not have to earn a living by 
working in the sun. 


AN OKLAHOMA JUDGE 


HE Black Despatch, Oklahoma 
City, Oklahoma, says: 

With the filing of impreachment 
charges against Judge Franklin E. Ken- 
namer in the Congress of the United 
States, the rotten American political sys- 
tem obtrudes its ugly head. Not satis 
fied with the recent attempt to slice the 
Northern District with the federal scis- 
sors and thereby cutting off Okfuskee 
county, where Judge Kennamer has given 
black folk their freedom for the first 
time since statehood, the denizens of 
hate and prejudice are now executing 
another flank movement, in the charges 


filed Wednesday. 


Judge Kennamer has been the unre- 
lenting, implacable foe of bootlegger ™ 
his district. He has taken a firm af 
courageous stand on the question of the

Negro’s right to vote in Oklahoma. Al- 
though an Alabamian, Judge Kennamer 
has shown that which it is possible to do 
‘a the realm of justice and fairness when 
you place a man from the South beyond 
the range of local sentiment and mob 
passions. In fact, in the Supreme Court 
of the United States, the Negro discov- 
ers that it is the white Southerner, when 
once cloistered beyond petty recalls and 
the yank of the demagogue, who has ren- 
dered the fairest decisions relating to the 
black man’s rights. 

But the mob spirit is after Kennamer. 
Oklahoma does not like this man _ be- 
cause he had the guts to aver, since his 
elevation to the federal bench, that a 
Negro could not get justice in state 
courts, More than 500 Negroes iin 
Okfuskee county now vote for the first 
time since statehood, because of his or- 
der. Oklahoma spent several thousand 
dollars of the taxpayers’ money to have 
this decision reversed, with no avail. 

No wonder it is difficult for a white 
man with a big heart, and a desire to 
administer equity and justice in his labors 
with his constituency, for the mob, the 
denizens of hate, will not wait to meet 
him out on the thoroughfares of life, 
they will go into his castle, into his 
home, to’ destroy his character and good 
name, if they think for one moment that 
he seeks to do the things that are right. 

Every citizen in the Northern federal 
district should write to the Oklahoma 
delegation in Congress; they should 
write to other fair-minded members of 
the national legislature and tell the truth 
about Judge Kennamer, for he is today 
in the hands of Pontius Pilate and the 
gang who would crucify him for right- 
eousness. 


A correspondent adds: 


Since statehood the Negroes of Okfus- 
kee County, in and near Boley, had 
never voted. Upon the elevation of Judge 
Kennamer to the bench, he immediately 
began to slam state officials in jail who 
tefused to allow Negroes their suffrage 
privileges. I personally raised last year 
a fund to assist in the appeal of the 
state of Oklahoma against a decision of 
Kennamer’s, (which we won) and a 
case wherein we had to spend more than 


$3,000. 


Because of this decision, more than 
100 blacks vote in and around Boley. 
The whites in the county have countered 
with a petition to Congress to take them 
out of Kennamer’s district and place 
them in the Eastern district, where they 
will be under Judge Robert L. Williams, 
tormer governor, and the man who called 
the special session of the legislature, 
while he was governor, when the vicious 
registration law of Oklahoma was 
passed. This bill, which would slice 
Okfuskee County out of Kennamer’s 
district, is now before the Senate Judi- 
cary Committee. ; 
very court town in Judge Kenna- 
mer’ district has passed resolutions of 
confidence, and there is not a litigant who 
as appeared before his court whose 


fame is signed to any of the affidavits 
before Congress,”

Nation are of interest to Negroes. 
“Notes From Washington” by Duff 
Gilfond in the November 14th issue, 
relates how Mr. Hoover, after refus- 
ing to see a Negro delegation for two 
weeks, at length agreed to discontinue 
Negro segregation in the Department 
of Commerce; and how Dr. Work, 
after seven conferences with the col- 
ored leaders, agreed to wipe out segre- 
gation in the Pension Office of the De- 
partment of the Interior, where, by 
the way, he had instituted it, but when 
asked to be equally fair about the Gen- 
eral Land Office, replied that he hadn’t 
put it there! 

An editorial in the November 21st 
issue says that Governor Smith’s break- 
ing of the South is an extraordinary 
political event—that Governor Smith 
brought about this historical happening, 
not Herbert Hoover. The South voted 
against the Governor of New York, 
not for Mr. Hoover. 

James M. Reinhardt writes on “Stu- 
dents and Race Feeling” in the Survey 
for November 15th and arrives at some 
interesting conclusions. He tabulates 
the racial attitudes of students in the 
University of North Dakota and at 
Morris Harvey College in West Vir- 
ginia and finds that the prejudices 
against Negroes are stronger among 
the rising generation in North Dakota 
than in West Virginia. Mr. Rein- 
hardt says in conclusion that the feel- 
ing against Negroes in both groups is 
not so strong as it is against some other 
races and nationalities, except where 
recognition of social equality is in- 
evitable. 

Africa for July carries an article on 
“Native Poetry in East Africa” by A. 
Werner. Swahili poetry and folk 
songs have a distinct metrical form, 
probably borrowed from the Arabic, 
but most of the poetry, however, is dif- 
ficult, as if the poet considered obscur- 
ity necessary to his art. 

The Atlantic Monthly for Decem- 
ber carries the first half of “Conjur” 
by Pernet Patterson. It is a story of 
the conflict and jealousy between black 
Runa, who for years had ruled her 
master’s house with uncanny quietude 
born of the power to cast “spells” on 
folks, and yellow Charlie, the new 
butler, smirking and bumptious in 
manner and gloating in his northern 
“eddication”’.

Tue Crisis 





To Crisis Readers: 


; E HOPE you have noticed the recent improvements in THE Crisis: the cover in colors, the 
odd) softly tinted paper, the selection of photographs, and the articles and editorials. 

We assume that you approve of THE Crisis because you are a reader. But we want 
to ask you to help us even further. Perhaps we insist too much on the unique position of THE Crists: 
it is the only radical periodical published in the United States which is self-supporting! Some people 
are not quite convinced that we are self-supporting. But we would be glad to prove this to any skeptics. 
From our income, paid by subscribers, advertisements and agents, we pay the salaries of everybody con- 
nected with THE Crisis, the cost of manufacturing THE Crisis, the rent of the offices, and all incidental 
expenses. This enables us to advocate the principles of the N. A. A. C. P. without being a burden upon 
its treasury. You must know from your own experience how seldom this is the case with any philan- 
thropic organization. 

But we can only continue this position of helpfulness and independence if our support is increased. 
This increase must come from advertising and from subscribers. THE Crisis carried in its NOvEM- 
BER number 62 paid advertisements, from leading schools, businesses and institutions. We want to 
attract more advertising of the highest kind. But we can do this only as our circulation increases. 

We want to ask you to help this increase in circulation in some of the following ways: 


1. Will you not renew your own subscription, unless you have already done so; and perhaps, send 
us an extended subscription for two to five years? 

2. Please consider a subscription to THE Crisis as a Christmas present. Most Christmas presents 
are pleasant, but wasteful reminders with no real intrinsic value. A year’s subscription to THE CRIsIs 
represents 12 recurring presents. Even if your subscription is for someone who is already a subscriber, 
nothing is lost for his subscription is extended for a year beyond his present term of expiration. You 
can give THE Crisis to a friend or to a stranger, to a college student, or to a young worker, to a mem- 
ber of the white, black or yellow race; to anyone who ought to hear its message. 


3. You can include in your Crists renewal of subscription, the price of a book or a number of 
books which should be added to your library. Sze our list. Do you realize how tremendously the 
number of interesting books concerning the Negro has increased in the last five years? 


4. You can send us the price of from one to ten subscriptions and let us distribute THE Crisis 
gratis. We will report to you just what we do with this money. We continually have calls for free 
copies of THE Crisis: for reading rooms, for old peosle, for students of race problems. 


§. Last and not least, you can send us the names and addresses of people to whom we may write, 
soliciting subscriptions: one, five, twenty-five names. Such addresses are very useful to us. 


Please think over the suggestions that we have made and see that if in this Christmas season you 
cannot only give joy to your friends, but do a good and effective stroke for THe Crisis and for the 
uplift of all men. 


That your Christmas be merry and 
your New Year filled with 
happiness is the sincere wish of
