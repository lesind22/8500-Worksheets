UICKER than a flash, at times, joy is 
turned into sorrow. It is also at 
such times that the lack of insurance pro- 
tection proves most embarrassing to the 
injured person or the bereaved family. 


The following testimonial gives the 
bright side to one of these dark pictures. 
It shows conclusively that insurance is 





the silver lining when the dark clouds of 
disaster drop upon us.

Gentlemen: 


I am taking this opportunity to express my thanks for the prompt 
payment of the death claim of my daughter, Catherine Saunders, who, along 
with two other persons, was killed in an automobile accident March 2, 1929 
at Plainfield, New Jersey. Her death was a serious blow to me, but I was 
certainly relieved of much worry by the prompt manner in which you settled 
her claim. 








I am wishing you a wonderful success in New Jersey, like you have 


had in Old Virginia. 





Thanking you again, I am, 
Gratefully yours, 


(signed) Sallie Saunders 


The above testimonial illustrates only one part of the trinity of insurance pro- 
tection which One Small Premium provides when placed with the Southern Aid 
Society of Va., Inc. That one premium entitles the insured to Weekly Benefits dur- 


ing periods of Sickness or Accident, as well as a Death Benefit to his beneficiary.

POSTSCRIPT 


EGROES have just won the gen- 

eral election in England. Oh, 
no! they didn’t vote, but the Labor 
Party which triumphed is co-signer of 
the Brussels declaration of August, 
1928. The Congress entirely condemns 
the principle of racial discrimination in 
Industry.—Henry Ford is promoting 
revolution by building a Ford factory 
and sending $30,000,000 worth of cars 
to the Soviet Government. Or per- 
haps he is merely anticipating revolu- 
tion. — President Hoover evidently 
means Peace when he says Peace. His 
Secretary of State tells us that a battle- 
ship costs $40,000,000. This is about 
equal to the total endowment of Yale 
University—Europe and Germany 
have agreed upon that little bill which 
the German working people must pay 
to the world’s millionaires for the priv- 
ilege of getting killed and licked.— 
In 1918, Europe wanted 125 thou- 
sand million dollars of Germany. In 
1920, she reduced it to 67 thousand 
million; in 1921, it become thirty-three 
thousand million, while today it is 
agreed upon as nine thousand million 
dollars. And the Allies won’t get even 
that—Congress is about to make a 


present of $100,000,000 to the Sugar 





ibe.

Trust to be taken out of the pockets of 
housewives who spend Five Dollars a 
week for groceries.—The special session 
of Congress for the relief of the farmer 
is planning to relieve him by increas- 
ing the cost of his shoes, his shingles, 
his clothes, his sugar, his matches, his 
cocoa, and nearly everything else that 
the starving merchants sell him.—The 
National Law Enforcement Commit- 
tee faces, according to the President, 
the fact that “no nation can for long 
survive the failure of its citizens to 
respect and obey the law which they 
themselves make.” This is a direct at- 
tack upon the dear South, which is be- 
ing re-arranged to cast its vote for the 
Republican Party in 1932.—The re- 
actionary majority in the Supreme 
Court has made two home runs this 
month. First, it handed over to the 
railroads about ten billion dollars of 
your money and mine. And it capped 
this by declaring that a middle-aged 
Hungarian woman cannot become a 
citizen of the United States unless she

is willing to kill somebody for the Star 
Spangled Banner.—The body of Sun 
Yat-Sen, founder of the Chinese Re- 
public, has moved in state among many 
millions to its tomb in the Purple 
Mountain above Nanking; and not 
even Feng, the “Christian” General 
and the traitor, Chiang-kai-shek, in 
their selfish broil, can wake it from its 
long sleep.—May the ghost of Charles 
Young stand by Alonzo Parham and 
Charles Weir, while they suffer hell 
for their race in West Point and An- 
napolis—With a cheerful ’tis—’taint 
and you shall—I sha’nt, the Vatican 
and Miussulini, have signed their’ 
Treaty of love in Rome and expansion 
in Africa.—It is surprising how rich 
we are: “Eighty-nine thousand million 
dollars of realized income,” says Pro- 
fessor Copeland of Cornell. How few 
of us realize this. Probably because 
of it, 15,000 American citizens com- 
mitted suicide last year.—Fifty years 
of electric lighting. Honor to Edison 
and some also to Latimer, the colored 
“Edison Pioneer”.—Berlin can run a 
profitable farm of 125,000 acres for 
the people because she has a Labor 
Party of one million. The Solid South 
saddles us with the Power Trust.

THE Crisis 








To the American Negro 
A Message from Mahatma Gandhi 


Mahandas Karamchand Gandhi, the 
greatest colored man in the world, and 
perhaps the greatest man in the world, 
was born October 2, 1869 in India. 
He finished High School and then stud- 
ied for three years in England at Lon- 
don University, and at the Law School 
of the Inner Temple. Returning, he 
began to practice law in Bombay, but 
not being successful, he went to South 
Africa in 1893, and there his public 
life began. He gave up the law and 
devoted himself to the Indian people 
who were being persecuted along with 
the natives in that land. He served 
with the Red Cross during the Boer 
War, attending friend and foe alike. 
For twenty years he toiled in South 
Africa to remove race prejudice. He 
led his people; he went to jail; he agi- 
tated; and finally triumphed by gain- 
ing for the Indians of South Africa a 
large measure of freedom. At the out- 
break of the Great War, he returned 
to India, and although a Pacifist, aided 
the great war. But when after the war 
there came repression, the massacre of 
Amritsar, and the infamous Rowlatt 
bills, Gandhi was disillusioned. He 
came out for Home Rule and an- 
nounced his great Gospel of conquest 
through peace. Agitation, non-violence, 
refusal to cooperate with the oppressor, 
became his watchword and with it he is 
leading all India to freedom. Here and 
today, he stretches out his hand in fel- 
lowship to his colored friends of the 
W est. 


Let not the 12 million Negroes be 
ashamed of the fact that they are the grand 
children of #re slaves. There is no dishonour 
in being slaves. There is dishonour in being 
slave-owners, But let us not think of honour 
or dishonour in connection with the past, 

Let us realise that the future is with those 

who would be truthful, pure and loving. For, 
as the old wise men have said, truth ever is, 
untruth never was. Love alone binds and 


truth and love accrue only to the truly

HE National Association for the 

advancement of Colored People 
had its origin in 1908 in the pressing 
need for an organization to combat the 
tide of race prejudice that was then 
rising throughout the nation. 

In the years just preceding race riots 
had become frequent in the North and 
there was grave danger that the con- 
ditions of the South were gradually 
spreading through the country. 

My wife and I were in Chicago late 
in 1908 when the riot occurred in 
Springfield, Illinois. We took the first 
train to Springfield and I wrote up the 
riot and discussed the race situation 
in its larger aspects in The Indepen- 
dent, urging the need for a nation-wide 
effort to combat the evil. 

A few weeks later my wife and I, 
just returned from Russia, spoke in 
Cooper Union and touched on the 
American race situation—worse, in 
some respects, than anything in Rus- 
sia under the Czarism. Having read 
my Independent article, Miss Oving- 
ton had come to the lecture and pro- 
posed at once that we undertake or- 
ganization. We both knew certain 
public spirited and influential people 
in New York who could be interested. 
Miss Ovington had the advantage, 
moreover, of personal acquaintance 
with several prominent colored people. 
The first of these whose interest we se- 
cured were Bishop Alexander Walters 
and Rev. W. H. Brooks. Among the 
whites I had broached the idea to 
Charles Edward Russell and Henry 
Moscowitz. _ Miss Lillian Wald and 
Mrs. Florence Kelly were also present 
at the earliest meetings. And in view 
of the influence and uncompromising 
attitude of The New York Evening 
Post we made a special point at the 
outset of laying the whole project be- 
fore Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard 
and of securing his active cooperation. 

The early meetings were nearly all 
held in my apartment, located at 21 
West 38th Street, in the very center 
of the city, and in this way we secured 
the frequent attendance of some very 
busy people. I shall not undertake to 
list all those in attendance at these ear- 
ly meetings. But there were scarcely 
more than a dozen all told and I be- 
lieve I have named those who were 
most active. 

The National Association was not 
founded and could not have been 
founded by any individual. And, in- 
deed, even the small group I have men- 
tioned was able to do little until, at

The Founding of the N. A. A. C. P. 


By WILLIAM ENGLISH WALLING 





There have been several versions 
of the founding of the N. A. A.C. 
P. This much is certain»the maga- 
zine article of Mr. Walling on the 
Springfield riots was the first step. 
Mr. Walling himself is the best 
authority on the steps that fol- 
lowed. 





our first national conference, we made 
arrangements to secure the permanent 
interest of a colored leader of nation- 
wide prominence, Dr. DuBois. 


Until that time our group was 
merely seeking, with moderate success, 
to enlist the colored people of the coun- 
try. We had secured, from the start, 
the favorable attention of the emanci- 
pated and advanced elements among 
the whites. But we all agreed that 
the organization itself had to give an 
example of successful cooperation of 
the races and that it must be founded 
upon the American principles of self- 
government and self-development. 


So I always date the real launching 
of the organization from the day we 
secured Dr. DuBois. And I must add 
that I feel we had a second birth when 
we secured our present Secretary, 


James Weldon Johnson. 


Because of the situation mentioned 
at the beginning of this sketch I had 
suggested naming our organ THE 
Crisis. By this time the worst of the 
“crisis” had passed. There was no 
longer any danger that the present 
South would further spread its new 
and peculiar institution of organized 
race prejudice throughout the North. 
On the contrary, the South was be- 
ginning to develop a certain humani- 
tarianism—though not yet a justice— 
of its own, a humanitarianism still in a 
rudimentary stage but growing—be- 
cause it is based solidly on economic 
common sense. So that the organiza- 
tion could now turn itself more and 
more to the object announced in its 
name, of which I had also been a pro- 
ponent, the “advancement” of colored 
people, the securing of equal rights and 
opportunities in every field and social 
and economic and political justice—in- 
stead of mere protection from lynch- 
ing (inside and outside the courtroom) 
from peonage and from other violent 
crimes. 


As the months passed into years the 
organization soon began to take its 
present form. Within the first few 


years a large part of our present di- 
rectors entered into office and the pres- 
ent character and policy of the organ- 
ization took shape at that time. So 
that the student of our organization 
should centre his attention on this pe- 
riod rather than the first year or two 
when Miss Ovington and I, alternat- 
ing as Chairman and Secretary, sup- 
ported by a handful of others, found it 
necessary to devote a considerable share 
of our time to getting the organization 
on its legs. For no sooner were we 
nationally organized with an office and 
a secretary than the association began 
to get active support, not only from 
all those of the present directors who 
date back to that period but from 
others too numerous to mention in this 
sketch. 

But there is one basic Association 
policy that must be accredited to the 
little founding group. We were de- 
termined that our personnel should be 
chosen on the broadest possible lines. 
Some of us were and are radicals. But 
we gave prominence to the conserva- 
tive editor of the conservative New 
York Evening Post for that very rea- 
son and held ourselves in the back- 
ground. We were determined not to 
become a little sect but leave our doors 
open to all colored people who would 
stand by their race and to all white 
people who would take their stand 
with them. We gladly accepted the 
aid of the conservative, not to say re- 
actionary, Senator Foraker and we 
barred no colored citizen of prominence 
merely because he had critics among 
certain sections of his race—though 
there was just that danger at our first 
national conference when a conserva- 
tive minority wanted us to adopt stand- 
ards so high as they thought—or so 
narrow, as it appeared to us, of the 
majority—that a large part of our 
most valuable leaders of to-day would 
never have been invited or admitted 
into the ruling circles of our organi- 
zation had these ideas prevailed. 

Once this danger had passed, the 
broad-gauge policy was settled upon 
and has been consistently followed un- 
til to-day. 4 

This is the spirit—liberal, demo- 
cratic and representative, not sectarian, 
radical, or dogmatic, devoted but not 
fanatical, that distinguishes our organ- 
ization from so many others and, to- 
gether with the genius and devotion 
of its present staff, accounts for its 
almost uniform success and its bril- 
liant achievements.

R. AND MRS. D. K. STROUD 
of Colorado Springs, Colorado, 
recently celebrated their twenty-fifth 
wedding anniversary quietly at their 
home. On March the thirtieth, nine- 
teen hundred four, in Chandler, Okla- 
homa, Lulu Magee, 22 years of age, 
of Alton, Illinois and Dolphus Stroud, 
thirty-two, of Navarro County, Texas, 
were united in matrimony by the Rev- 
erend J. B. F. Westbrooks, pastor of 
the Sweet Home Baptist Church. For 
four years prior to his marriage, Mr. 
Stroud had been a teacher in the pub- 
lis schools of Lincoln County, Okla- 
homa. For six additional years he con- 
tinued in this capacity, during which 
time four children were born to him 
and Mrs. Stroud. Later, they mi- 
grated to Colorado Springs, Colorado, 
where they have remained for the past 
nineteen years, and where Mr. Stroud 
conducts a trucking business.

The Strouds Celebrate Their Silver 


Wedding 


By MRS. LULU STROUD 


What do we mean when we say 
that American Negroes are ad- 
vancing? What becomes of the 


families who leave the South for 


the freer North? Here is one con- 
crete answer written for THE 
Crisis by a black mother. 





The couple are the parents of eleven 
children, all living, six of whom are 
girls and five boys. Kimbal Stroud, 
the eldest, who is now Mrs. Goffman 
and the mother of two boys, graduated 
from the Colorado Springs High 
School at the age of seventeen. She 
has a good husband, a modern two- 
story home and a motor car. Albert, 
the second child, who graduated from 
high school at the age of nineteen, is 
now operating a trucking business in 
Maywood, Illinois, a suburb of Chi- 


The Stroud Family 


Standing: Jack, Number Nine, Dolphus, Effie 
Sitting: James, Bobbie, the Father, Rosa Mae, 


cago. He owns two powerful trucks. 

Dolphus, the third child, graduated 
from high school with honors at the 
age of seventeen, winning a scholarship 
to Colorado College. In addition to 
being the only Negro man student at- 
tending that institution at the present 
time, he has the highest scholastic aver- 
age of all the men of the sophomore 
class. He has also won some distinc- 
tion in athletics. Some time ago he 
participated in the Cheyenne Moun- 
tain Marathon, sponsored by Spencer 
Penrose, Colorado multi-millionaire, 
and owner of the Broadmoor Hotel. 
Dolphus captured eighth place in that 
event, the first seven places going to 
Zuni and Hopi Indians from Arizona 
and New Mexico. Later, while train- 
ing for the Rocky Mountain Olympic 
tryouts, he established a new record 
for the round trip to the summit of 
Pike’s Peak. While making this rec-

ord, he established the second best ever 
made for the ascent of the mountain 
and broke the descending record of one 
hour and _ twenty-nine minutes by 
forty-one minutes. Last June he cap- 
tured first place in the five thousand 
meter race at the Rocky Mountain 
Olympic tryouts held in Denver. For 
this feat he received a gold medal. 
Then, after being forced to hitch-hike 
his way across the continent to Bos- 
ton, he participated in the final Olym- 
pic trials there, though failing to place. 
In spite of working from six to eight 
hours every day on the side he is mak- 
ing a splendid record in college. 
Effie, the fourth child, graduated 
from the Colorado Springs High 
School with honors at the age of seven- 
teen, winning the Henry Sachs Schol- 
arship to Colorado College. During 
her high school career she won first 
honors in a chemistry essay contest. In 
the all-state contest she won second 
honors, for which she received a set of 
valuable books. She too is a sophomore 
at Colorado College and is the only 
colored girl in that institution. 





Tandy, the fifth child, graduated 
from high school at seventeen with the 
highest honors of any of the Stroud 
children. He too won a scholarship to 
Colorado College; but, since he pre- 
ferred to attend a race institution, he 
is now a freshman at Howard Uni- 
versity, Washington, D. C. While in 
high school, he won every cross-country 
race in which he participated, establish- 
ing a new record for the course. For 
this feat he received a gold medal. He 
won the championship of the South 
Central League in the mile-run and 
was placed third in that event at the 
Boulder relays and State Meet. He 
is the proud possessor of three beautiful 
medals and a sweater, as the result 
of his athletic work. He was also a 
member of the football squad during 
his high school days, even though he 
was the youngest and one of the small- 
est boys in his class. 

Jack, the fifth child, a lad of fifteen, 
is now a sophomore in high school. He 
graduated from grade school with the 
highest scholastic average of his class. 
James, a boy of thirteen, and Lulu, a 





girl of twelve, are both in the junior 
high school. Number Nine, a girl 
of nine years, is in the fifth grade. In 
the last report she secured the highest 
scholastic average in the entire school 
of two hundred and fifty pupils, mak- 
ing a perfect record of eleven A’s in 
eleven subjects. 


Rosa Mae, a girl of seven, is in the 
second grade. She and Number Nine 
in their kindergarten days made the 
highest scores of all the children in the 
town in a city-wide intelligence test. 
Bobbie, a girl of four, is the baby and 
has not yet entered school. 

This is the record that Lulu Magee 
and Dolphus Stroud have established. 
In their twenty-five years of married 
life they have never been separated 
from each other for as much as seven 
continuous days. 

Please give me space in your paper 
for this account, as it might prove help- 
ful to some young couple who are now 
struggling through some of the diff- 
culties which my husband and I have 
conquered.

Negro Authors and White Publishers 


By JAMES WELDON JOHNSON 


EGRO writers, like all writing 

folks, have many things to com- 
plain about. Writers have always felt 
and many of them have plainly said 
that the world did not fully appreciate 
their work. This attitude has seldom 
been justified. The great or good 
writers who have not been acknowl- 


228 


edged as such by the generation in 
which they lived are rare. And where 
such acknowledgement has not been 
accorded by the generations which 
touched an author’s life, posterity has 
hardly ever revoked the unfavorable 
judgment. 
Nevertheless, have 


writers many 


good reasons for complaining ; for their 
lot is a hard one. And it may be that 
Negro writers have some special good 
reasons for complaining; I am not sure 
that at the present time this is so. How- 
ever that may be, there is one complaint 
that some younger Negro writers are 
uttering with greater and greater in-

sistance which I do not think is based 
on the facts and which reacts to the 
injury of the writers uttering it. This 
complaint is: that the leading white 
publishers have set a standard which 
Negro writers must conform to or go 
unpublished; that this standard calls 
only for books depicting the Negro in 
a manner which tends to degrade him 
in the eyes of the world; that only 
books about the so-called lower types 
of Negroes and lower phases of Negro 
life find consideration and acceptance. 

Now, in the first place, there is a 
certain snobbishness in terming the less 
literate and less sophisticated, the more 
simple and more primitive classes of 
Negroes as “lower”. At least as liter- 
ary material, they are higher. They 
have greater dramatic and artistic po- 
tentialities for the writer than the so- 
called higher classes, who so closely 
resemble the bourgeois white classes. 
The vicious and criminal elements— 
and we must admit that even in our 
own race there are such elements—are 
rightly termed “lower”, but even they 
have more accessible dramatic values 
than the ordinary, respectable middle- 
class element. It takes nothing less 
than supreme genius to make middle- 
class society, black or white, interesting 
—to say nothing of making it dramatic. 

But I am jotting down this brief es- 
say with the prime purpose of pointing 
out the dangers, especially to young 
writers, in complaining that publish- 
ers refuse to consider their work be- 
cause it portrays Negro life on too high 
a level. When a writer begins to say 
and then believe that the reason why 
he cannot get published is because his 
work is foo good he is in a bad way. 
This is the way that leads to making 
a fetish of failure. It is a too easy 
explanation of the lack of accomplish- 
ment. It is this “superior work—sor- 








did publishers—low brow public” com- 
plex that gives rise to the numerous 
small coteries of unsuccessful writers, 
white as well as colored; the chief 
function of the members of these co- 
teries being the mutual admiration of 
each other’s unpublished manuscripts. 
This attitude brings its adherents to a 
position of pathetic futility or ludicrous 
superiority. 

Within these seven or eight years of 
literary florescence I doubt that any 
first class publisher has turned down 
first rate work by any Negro writer on 
the ground that it was not on a low 
enough level. Now, suppose we look 
at the actual facts as shown by the 
books published in these recent years 
by leading publishers. Let us first 
take fiction and list the books depicting 
Negro life on the “upper” levels or 
shedding a favorable light on the race 
that have been published:

Now, those depicting Negro life on

The score is eight to six—with 
“Tropic Death’, “Walls of Jericho” 
and “Cane” on the border line. In 
non fiction the “upper level’’ litera- 
ture scores still higher. In that class 
we have:

In the other column, in non fiction, 
we have only: 


The Weary Blues..... Langston Hughes 
Fine Clothes to the Jew, 
Langston Hughes 


And it must be said that although 
Mr. Hughes shows a predilection for 
singing the “lower” and “humbler” 
classes of Negroes, these two volumes 
contain many poems that are highly in- 
spirational. 


In non fiction the score is nineteen 
to two. I do not see how any one who 
looks at these figures can fail to see 
that the complaint against the publish- 
ers is not in consonance with the facts. 
I believe that Negro writers who have 
something worth while to say and the 
power and skill to say it have as fair 
a chance today of being published as 
any other writers. 


New York’s Committee of One Hundred 


INEZ RICHARDSON WILSON 


URING the year of 1924, a 

group of New York women 
known as “The Committee of One 
Hundred” gave a very successful 
benefit for the National Association 
for the Advancements of Colored 
People under the _ leadership of 
Mrs. Helen Curtis. They were 
not at that time known as a _ per- 
manent auxiliary, but on finding their 
group to be particularly interested in 
promoting benefits for the National

Association and unusually enthusiastic, 
they decided to form themselves into a 
permanent organization to be known 
as the Committee of One Hundred 
Women, Auxiliary to the N. A. A. C. 
P. This Committee was organized on 
May 10th, 1924, at a luncheon meet- 
ing. A Constitution was drawn up 
with the assistance of a National Offi- 
cer and standing committees formed. 
These committees, known as Member- 
ship, Entertainment, Publicity, Edu- 


cational, Legal Redress, and an Ad- 
visory Board made a working nucleus 
for the promotion of plans to be pre- 
sented to and voted on by the general 
body. 

The Entertainment and Member- 
ship Committees have been of the 
greatest importance because our efforts 
have been confined particularly to the 
business of raising money for the Na- 
tional Office. During the past two

Captain 


HE writing of history is curious 

business. It is not simply “lies 
agreed upon” that makes the part of 
the American Negro in history un- 
known or forgotten; it is more often 
a little matter of emphasis. One does 
not talk of Estevanico simply because 
most historians fail to mention that this 
black man was the discoverer of the 
Southwest United States. They do not 
deny it; they merely forget it. One 
does not say that the 5th of March, 
commemorating the death of Crispus 
Attucks, was the first national Amer- 
ican holiday. It is true, but, says the 
average historian, what of it? And 
so the part which Negroes, and Amer- 
ican Negroes, played in the freeing of 
Cuba from the domination of Spain 
was a matter quite well-known at the 
time, but today almost forgotten. 

It was not only Maceo and his dark 
fellows in the field that freed Cuba. 
There were Negroes in America that 
helped with arms and men, and fore- 
most among them was Captain James 
W. Floyd of Jacksonville, Florida. 

There were during the Cuban re- 
volt Cuban clubs with colored mem- 
bers in New York, Chicago, in all 
Southern cities, and particularly in the 
cities of Florida, like Tampa, Jackson- 
ville and Key West. They contributed 
10% of their wages for years to the 
Revolutionary Fund. Their leader for 
a long time was José Marti, who, at 
the end of the 10-years’ war, took 
refuge in New York. He was killed 
in 1895. Palma, then teaching a 
school in New York State, succeeded 
Marti as the American representative 
and became active in smuggling arms 
from America to the Revolutionists. 
‘There was much treason, bribery and 
double-crossing in this work, and 
many persons and boats took part, but 
the success of the whole smuggling 
campaign depended largely on Captain 
James W. Floyd. 

An ocean-going tug, called the 
“Dauntless”, was purchased by the 
Cuban Junta from the Brunswick 
Navigation Company for $30,000 in 
1896. It was a new and fine boat, 
measuring 125 feet, and capable of 
making 13 knots an hour. 

James W. Floyd, a colored Jackson- 
ville pilot, with a Master’s license, was 
made mate of the “Dauntless” with the 
understanding that the white Captain, 
who was in the tug when she was pur- 
chased, should be in command until 
he found the place too dangerous. In 
that case, Floyd was to become Cap- 
tain. As a matter of fact, the white 
Captain made only two voyages. After 
that, Floyd became Captain, and from

This is a story of the Cuban 
Revolution, showing that Cuba 
gained her freedom, not simply by 
the leadership and help of her 
Negro citizens, but also by the co- 
operation of an American Negro 
sea Captain. 


Captain Floyd and his Cuban medals. 


that time until war was declared by the 
United States against Spain, the 
“Dauntless” and Captain Floyd were 
the chief means of furnishing the Cu- 
ban revolutionists with arms and am- 
munition. The “Dauntless” made in 
all eleven landings of arms and men in 
Cuba without the loss of a man or 
rifle. 


In the official histories of the Ameri- 
cans on the Spanish War, the name of 
Captain Floyd is not mentioned, but 
Cuba never forgot him, and whenever 
you hear about what the “Dauntless” 
did for Cuban freedom, remember that 
Floyd was its Captain. 


The first voyage of the “Dauntless” 
was to take Fred Funston and a load 
of arms from Florida to Cuba. On 
this voyage Floyd was mate. The 
“Dauntless” was lying at the landing 
below the railroad bridge at Woodbine 
on the Satilla River under a full head 
of steam. A tug gave her an extra 
supply of coal and at sunrise they were 
off for Cuba. The Spanish Govern- 
ment, suspecting an expedition, had 
protested at Washington, but while 
Government agents were watching at 
Charleston and Jacksonville, the 
“Dauntless” left from Woodbine, 
August 14th, and three days later they 
dodged a Spanish gunboat and landed 


Floyd and Cuba Libre 





a Cuban General and his men, to- 
gether with Funston and a load of 
arms ashore 12 miles east of Nuevitas, 
Cuba. Within a week the “Daunt- 
less” landed three such cargoes and 
then headed for Key West and Bruns- 
wick, Ga., with Floyd as captain. 

She was promptly seized by the Cus- 
tom House authorities at Brunswick, 
but freed because no evidence was sub- 
mitted to the court. In fact, the local 
officials were in sympathy with the 
Cuban revolution. 

On October 26th, the ‘Dauntless 
again landed a cargo of men and arms, 
which had been brought down by spe- 
cial train, east of Cienfuegos. The 
Government at Washington was much 
incensed at this breaking of the Neu- 
trality Laws and the revenue cutters 
began to get busy. The “Dauntless” 
was ostensibly sold and used for a 
while as a tow-boat between Jackson- 
ville and the mouth of the St. John’s 
river; but, of course, the Cubans had 
reserved the right to buy her back. 

Early in 1897, the “Dauntless” took 
over a cargo which another boat had 
failed to land. In spite of many mis- 
haps, the cargo was landed on the 
morning of January 3rd near Cape 
Corrientes, where the mulatto Maceo 
was leading the Revolutionists. An- 
other cargo with General Nunez and 
twenty men and arms were landed May 
21st, ten miles east of Nuevitas. In all 
these cases the “Dauntless” innocently 
left Florida without cargo and re- 
turned without cargo, so that it was 
difficult to prove that she had been to 
Cuba. 

Later, two carloads of arms and am- 
munition were secretly shipped down 
to Fort Lauderdale near Miami, put 
on a coaster and transferred to the 
“Dauntless” at sea. They were chased 
by a third-class cruiser named the 
Marblehead. The confidential navi- 
gator on board the coaster disagreed 
with Floyd as to what vessel it was. 
Floyd advised running for the Bahama 
banks, but the officials on the tug wait- 
ed until it was too late. Nevertheless, 
the “Dauntless gave her a chase and 
the Commander informed Washington 
that he had to put on full steam in 
order to overhaul it. Afterward, the 
government took measurements of the 
“Dauntless” in order to discover the 
secret of her speed. 

When the “Dauntless” was cap- 
tured, a Lieutenant boarded her and 
called for the Captain. Floyd stepped 
forward and asserted that he was in 
search of a wreck, and that he had no 
idea the cruiser was pursuing until she 
began to drop shells.

“What are these boxes?’ asked the 
Lieutenant, pointing to the boxes of 
ammunition. 

“Sardines,” said Floyd, innocently. 

The officer returned to the Cruiser 
taking Floyd with him and the Captain 
examined him again. The “Dauntless” 
followed the cruiser to Key West 
where Captain Floyd and all of the 
smugglers were ordered arrested for 
organizing a military expedition 
against a friendly power. They were 
all released after trial and the ‘“‘Daunt- 
less’ went back, finished the transfer- 
ring of arms, and started again for 


Cuba. 


This time she was partly disabled by 
an explosion of her boiler and was 
towed back to the Florida reef by the 
same boat from which she had taken the 
cargo. Afterward, she was towed to 
Key West by the revenue cutter Col- 
fax. The “Dauntless” had a full load 
on board but before arraignment, they 
were towed to Jacksonville for repairs. 
Then the boat, instead of returning di- 
rectly to Key West went outside the 
harbor and up to Brunswick, Georgia. 
By the time it had finished this running 
about no evidence of any kind was 
found on board and the crew was set 
free. After that, the arms were re- 
shipped, and finally landed in Cuba 
October 10th. 


This escapade made the “Dauntless” 





and her Captain notorious, and the 
Spanish Minister declared that but for 
the aid thus given the Cubans the re- 
volt would have been suppressed long 
before. Several warships, including 
the Maine and Marblehead had been 
patroling Southern waters against this 
one little tugboat and it was estimated 
that the Navy had spent a million dol- 
lars to stop the filibustering. 


The “Dauntless” continued dodging 
about and landing cargoes in Cuba and 
orders were telegraphed Captain Sigs- 
bee, who commanded the Maine, to 
keep his eye on this boat. Six weeks 
later, the Maine was blown up in the 
Spanish harbor. On the night of Feb- 
ruary 16th, about twenty-four hours 
after the explosion of the Maine, the 
“Dauntless”, leaving in a thick fog, 
landed a twelve-pound gun and other 
arms inside the harbor at Matanzas. 
On returning, the ‘Dauntless’ was 
seized by the Government but the pro- 
ceeding was perfunctory, as war against 


Spain was declared April 25, 1898. 


In 1927, the Cuban government de- 
termined to reward the foreigners who 
had helped in Cuban freedom, and 
among those who were given medals 
and certificates was Captain James 
Floyd. The orator of the occasion 
said: 

“Cuba has, to a certain extent, paid 
her debt to those brave men who helped 


The Dauntless. 





her when she was crushed under the 
heel of the tyrant and trying hard to 
shake the oppressing weight of despot- 
ism. To these brave and good men, 
we owe much. They, together with 
the emigrados, made possible the inde- 
pendence of Cuba. And Cuba could 
never forget, as it has not forgotten, 
the help tendered her in those terrible 
days of struggle and frightfulness gone 
now never to return again. 

“T said that Cuba owed much to 
these men and to the emigrados. This 
may savour of ingratitude to the great 
and glorious army of liberators, but, of 
course, this could never be thought of. 
Truly the armies of Free Cuba did 
mightily. They were ragged; they 
were hungry; they were tired and sick; 
they hardly had arms and munitions to 
fight their enemies who were in over- 
whelming numbers; almost no medi- 
cines to fight the terrible diseases of the 
jungle—malaria and dysentery; and 
yet, they hung on like lions and fought 
like demons against the well-fed and 
better equipped armies of Spain. But 
those which arms they had, that scant 
supply of ammunition, that infinitesi- 
mal provision of medical stores,was sup- 
plied by the emigrados and carried over 
the seas by men like Captain James W. 
Floyd. And that, friends of Cuba, is 
something we have never forgotten and 
it is not likely we will ever forget.

The Slave 
By F. MARSHALL DAVIS 
(For A Bass Viol) 


ERE was titanic sorrow 
condensed 
in the ebony splendor 
of a black man’s face. 


Here was a form 

on which the mark 

of a parasite civilization 
had been branded 

burning deeply 

exposing a soul 
contaminating it 

with the purple of sadness. 


Should not a soul sing of joy? 
Should not a soul sing of peace? 


“Lord, deliver me 
You helped Daniel 
You helped David 
You helped Moses, too 
Lord, let my people go.” 


Here was sadness 
carved on a black man’s soul. 


Color Blind 
By EUNICE K. BIDDLE 


LACK! 
This skin is black. 

Not from a choice of mine 

But through a quirk, a crazy chance of 
fortune. 

Yet daily they scourge me 

As though I were to blame; 

Lash me with their scorn, 

Mock me with their tongues, 

Scuff me with their feet, 

Those lighter ones, 

Whom fate in kinder mood 

Took time to bleach. 

Nor do they stop to think, 

That underneath this skin 

A heart beats and a soul struggles for 
life, 

Bruised by every smirk, bleeding from 
their words. 

They cannot see—the color blinds them. 


To a Colored Boy

MBER pixy, 

Author of dark mischief— 
My heart goes out to you; 
Other children 

Smile at your antics now; 
Dusky laughter 

Bursts from your impish lips 
Will you turn old 

When you first know the pain 
Dark pigment brings?

Brown Youth 

By MILTON BRIGHTE 

ERHAPS in Africa 

An ancient replica 
Of me, with sinews black 
Stalked down some tangled track 
In search of meat, with ear 
Alert for danger near. 
Down from the jungle skies 
A sun, tinged with strange dyes 
Would drop its awful heat 
Where velvet, taloned feet 
So lately fell. Not I 
All naked ‘neath the sky, 
But savage black and odd 
Would raise his hands to God 
Then dance a wanton dance 
Within some tomtom trance. 
This day I’m far from where 
My fathers drank the air, 
While in mad ecstacy 
They whirled. No verdant tree 
Whose hair is pale by moon, 
Or burning gold at noon 
Excites my limbs to leap 
Or bend, until mild sleep 
Makes me satiate. No 
Thought now could ever go 
Back to my father’s home, 
Where o’er the leafy loam 
Strong bodies walked. When lights 
Of halls, when moons of nights 
Are strongest, when horns blow 
Their jazz, now all will know— 
No dream of Congo marsh 
Where tiger, roaring harsh 
Comes to drink, enters me. 
I do not want to see 
My image, rippling on 
Some pool, naked. At dawn 
I do not want to hear 
A tomtom, knowing fear 
For some ferocious beasts 
Or maddened soul whose breasts 
Tenant wilder hearts. Go 
Back now to long ago— 
To years I do not know, 
There with rhythmic dance slow 
A wild, strong youth you'll see— 
Dead replica of me.

THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 


ué 
20TH YEAR TRIBUTES 
HAT the world thinks of the 
National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People pro- 
foundly matters to the continuance of 
its work. Standing for “the world”, 
are leaders in various professions and 
in cultural life. On the threshold of 
its Twentieth Anniversary Conference, 
in the midst of a campaign to raise 
$200,000 that its work might be car- 
ried forward and extended, the N. A. 
A. C. P. asked leaders in various parts 
of the world to say what they thought 
of its record. 


Will W. Alexander, Atlanta, Di- 
rector of the Commission on Inter- 
racial Cooperation: 

May I offer my congratulations and 
best wishes to the N. A. A. C. P. on 
the approaching Twentieth Anniver- 
sary? 

Some such movement as the N. A. A. 
C. P. was inevitable and necessary. The 
vigilance of the Association in protect- 
ing Negroes from exploitation and in- 
justice has been of great value, not only 
in the specific cases which have been 
handled, but also in serving notice that 
such things will not go unchallenged. 
The Association has rendered a valu- 
able service in its constant emphasis 
upon the national aspects of lynching 
and mob violence. The development of 
a national conscience on this question 
was a necessary part in any program 
for ridding the country of the evil. The 
work of the Association in giving pub- 
licity to certain individual cases of mob 
violence has helped to give right- 
minded people a consciousness of the 
hideousness of the whole procedure. 

The Association, largely under Ne- 
gro leadership, has given great encour- 
agement to Negroes and helped to stim- 
ulate initiative among them in solving 
their own problems. The importance 
of this is obvious. Initiative in dealing 
with one’s own problems is the surest 
way out. 

The Association has helped to train 
and develop important Negro leaders. 
It is doubtful if in any other field these 
men would have found as much free- 
dom for self-expression and develop- 
ment as has been given them by the 
Association. 

In the use of the Spingarn medal, 
the Association has turned the light of 
national understanding and apprecia- 
tion upon Negroes whose good work 


July, 1929 











At the May Meeting of the 
Board of Directors of the N. A. 
A.C. P., the following resolution 
was passed by a rising vote: 

The Board of Directors wishes 
to record its deep sense of loss in 
the death of Paul Kennaday. Mr. 
Kennaday took part in our Second 
Conference in 1910, was elected to 
the Board of Directors in 1911, 
and was one of the incorporators 
of the Association. He has been 
a faithful comrade and co-worker, 
and his deep, intellectual interest 
in the many difficult problems of 
our organization will be sadly 
missed. 

Resolved that a copy of this res- 
olution be sent to Mrs. Kenna- 
day; also that it be published in 
THE Crisis. 





entitled them to a recognition, regard- 
less of race and color. This was a 
much-needed emphasis. It is of the 
highest importance that the nation 
should realize that Negroes can do in 
a first-class way any work which other 
men can do. The awarding of the 
Spingarn Medal has not only empha- 
sized this in the mind of white Amer- 
ica, but has been a means of increasing 
the confidence of Negroes in their own 
ability to do first-class work. 


Charles A. Beard, historian, teacher, 
author “The Rise of American Civili- 
zation”, and other works on history: 

On the occasion of its twentieth an- 
niversary the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People in- 


The 20th Annual Conference of 
the N. A. A. C. P. will meet at 
Cleveland, Ohio, June 26th to July 
2, 1929. The headquarters will be 
at Mount Zion Congregational 
Church, East 55th Street and Cen- 
tral Avenue. 

The day sessions will take place 
at this church and mass: meetings 
will be held at Shiloh Baptist 
Church, St. John A. M. E. Church, 
and the Public Auditorium. 

Among the speakers will be the 
Mayor of the city, Nannie H. Bur- 
roughs, Charles §. Johnson, Mrs. 
Sallie W. Stewart, Judge Ira W. 
Jayne, the Honorable Hamilton 
Fish, Dr. Mordecai W. Johnson, 
Honorable Oscar DePriest, Mr. J. 
E. Spingarn, the officers of the As- 


sociation and others. 





vites the special consideration and sup- 
port of the American public. Many- 
sided in its activities, the Association 
appeals to every type of human sym- 
pathy. Even the conservative citizen 
who thinks that one phase of its work 
is unwise or of doubtful utility can 
certainly find another that corresponds 
to his or her sense of right. Ranging 
in its interests from the prevention of 
lynching and peonage to the encour- 
agement of creative achievements in 
the arts by Negroes, the Association, in 
fact, calls for aid in various lines. By 
way of illustration, it naturally lays 
great stress on the maintenance of the 
civil rights guaranteed to all by law 
and lends assistance to Negroes who 
are without financial resources in de- 
fending themselves. The importance 
of such work is self-evident. If anyone 
has any doubts on this score let him 
read R. H. Smith’s Justice and the 
Poor (Carnegie Foundation for the 
Advancement of Teaching) and dis- 
cover how difficult it is for the poor 
in purse to employ competent lawyers. 


Countee Cullen, poet, editor ‘“Car- 
oling Dusk”, author “Color”, and 
“Copper Sun”: 

I can conceive of no organization 
that is playing a more constructive and 
important role in Negro life than the 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People. From one 
end of the land to the other it has 
since its inception waged an unremit- 
ting battle in defense of the colored 
step children of America. A steady if 
sometimes disheartening march has 
broken down barrier after barrier, so- 
cial iniquity upon social iniquity, and 
has actually in numberless cases forced 
a more accurate interpretation of the 
American Constitution. To support 
this organization should be a matter 
of pride for every Negro, rather than 
one of compulsion or tedious persua- 
sion. 


Sinclair Lewis, novelist, author 
“Main Street”, “Babbitt”, ‘“Dods- 
worth”, and other novels: 

This is not so much an appraisal of 
the work of the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored Peo- 
ple as a rather sorrowful acknowledge- 
ment that, in the considerable stress 
of novel-writing, I have been unable 
to give myself to this work. 

For, while I know but little of the 
details of its actual work, I know a

| |THE BROWSING READER | 


% 


HAVE just read 
Claude McKay’s 


three novels: 
“Banjo”, (Harp- 
er’s), Nella Larsen’s ‘Passing’, 
(Knopf), and Wallace Thurman’s 
“The Blacker the Berry” (Macauley). 


The first two novels are second ad- 
ventures in fiction; the one by a poet; 
the other by a new writer. The third, 
has been the basis of a rather success- 
ful popular musical show. 


BANJO 

LAUDE McKAY’S “Banjo” is a 

better book than ‘“‘Home to Har- 
lem”. It is full of experience, vivid, 
and, of course, colorful as all McKay’s 
work must be. It is described as “‘a 
story without a plot’, but it is hardly 
even that. It is in no sense a novel, 
either in the nature of its story or in 
the development of character. It is, 
on the one hand, the description of a 
series of episodes on the docks of Mar- 
seilles; and on the other hand a sort 
of international philosophy of the Ne- 
gro race. It is this latter aspect which 
seems to me to make it of most value. 


The first aspect of the book is neg- 
ligible. It is really a continuation of 
experiences like Jake’s in “Home to 
Harlem”. Here are a lot of people 
whose chief business in life seems to be 
sexual intercourse, getting drunk, and 
fighting. Their comments on this kind 
of life are picturesque, but there is 
nothing intriguing and there is a great 
deal of repetition. The characters, 
while minutely described, do not stand 
out. Even, the Arab woman, Latnah 
is vague and unfinished, while Banjo 
himself lacks even the interest of Jake. 
Ray, alone, (a character taken over 
from the foimer novel), seems like 
flesh and blood, and probably is largely 
a counterpart of the author. 

The race philosophy, on the other 
hand, is of great interest. McKay has 
become an international Negro. He 
is a direct descendant from Africa. He 
knows the West Indies; he knows 
Harlem; he knows Europe; and he 
philosophizes about the whole thing. 
He speaks of Ray’s urge to write: 

“He was always writing panhandling 
letters to his friends, and naturally he 
began to feel himself lacking in the free 
splendid spirit of his American days. 
More and more the urge. to write was 
holding him with an enslaving grip and 
he was beginning to feel that any means 
of achieving self-expression was justi- 


fiable.” 
234 





He defends plain talk about Negros: 


“I think about my race as much as 
you. I hate to see it kicked around and 
spat on by the whites, because it is a 
good earth-loving race. I'll fight with it 
if there’s a fight on, but if I am writing a 
story—well, it’s like all of us in this 
place here, black and brown and white, 
and I telling a story for the love of it.” 


With the characteristic reaction of 
the West Indian who does not thor- 
oughly know his America, he is bitter 
about “society” Negroes in America 
and contrasts them with the society he 
saw in the West Indies: 

“In my home we had an upper class of 
Negroes, but it had big money and prop- 
erty and power. It wasn’t just a moving- 
picture imitation. School-teachers and 
clerks didn’t make any ridiculous pre- 
tenses of belonging to it. I could write 
about the society of Negroes you mean, 
if I wrote a farce 


“Tf you think it’s fine for the society 
Negroes to fool themselves on the cheap- 
est of imitations, I don’t. I am fed up 
with class. The white world is stinking 
rotten and going to hell onit . . . 

“The best Negroes are not the society 
Negroes. I am not writing for them, nor 
the pork-chop-abstaining Negroes, nor 
the Puritan Friends of Color, nor the 
Negrophobes nor the Negrophiles. I am 
writing for people who can stand a real 
story no matter where it comes from.” 


Turning from such bitter criticism 
of his own race, he slashes at the 
whites : 

“You don’t know why the white man 
put all his dirty jokes on to the race? 
It’s because the white man is dirty in his 
heart and got to have dirt. But he covers 
it up in his race to show himself superior 
and put it on to us. The Yankees used 
to make jokes out of the Germans. Then 
when the Germans got strong enough to 
stop that, they got it out of the Irish and 
Jews. When the Irish and Jews got too 
rich and powerful in politics, they turn 
to Italians and Negroes.” 


And finally comes this evaluation 
and comparison: 


“All the things you say about the Ne- 
gro’s progress is true. You see race 
prejudice over there drives the Negroes 
together to develop their own group life. 
American Negroes have their own 
schools, churches, newspapers, theatres, 
cabarets, restaurants, hotels. They work 
for the whites, but they have their own 
social group life, an intense, throbbing, 
vital thing in the midst of the army of 
whites milling around them. There is 
nothing like it in the West Indies nor in 
Africa, because there you don’t have a 
hundred-million strong white pressure 


De 


that just carries the Negro group along 
with it. Here in Europe you have more 
social liberties than Negroes have in 
America, but you have no warm group 
life. You need colored women for that. 
Women that can understand us as human 
beings and not as wild over-sexed sav- 
ages.” 

As a book of racial philosophy, 
“Banjo” is most inspiring. And for 
this very reason perhaps ‘““The Home 
to Harlem” aspect,—the dirt of the 
docks and the maudlin indulgence, 
fades away as the book evolves, and 
Banjo himself becomes almost a for- 
gotten person when he returns from 
working in coal to take up his role as 
hero. 


PASSING ‘ 
ELLA LARSEN’S “Passing’’ is 


one of the finest novels of the 
year. If it did not treat a forbidden 
subject—the inter-marriage of a stodgy 
middle-class white man to a _ very 
beautiful and = selfish octoroon—it 
would have an excellent chance to be 
hailed, selected and recommended. As 
it is, it will probably be given the “si- 
lence”, with only the commendation 
of word of mouth. But what of that? 
It is a good close-knit story, moving 
along surely but with enough leisure to 
set out seven delicately limned char- 
acters. Above all, the thing is done 
with studied and singularly success- 
ful art. Nella Larsen is learning how 
to write and acquiring style, and she 
is doing it very simply and clearly. 
Three colored novelists have lately 
essayed this intriguing and ticklish sub- 
ject of a person’s right to conceal the 
fact that he had a grandparent of Ne- 
gro descent. It is all a petty, silly mat- 
ter of no real importance which an- 
other generation will comprehend with 
great difficulty. But today, and in the 
minds of most white Americans, it is 
a matter of tremendous moral import. 
One may deceive as to killing, stealing 
and adultery, but you must tell your 
friend that you’re “colored”, or suffer 
a very material hell fire in this world, 
if not in the next. The reason of all 
this, is of course that so many white 
people in America either know or fear 
that they have Negro blood. My 
friend, who is in the Record Depart- 
ment of Massachusetts, found a lady’s 
ancestry the other day. Her colored 
grandfather was a soldier in the Revo-

O all folk the problem of summer, 

rest and change, of vacation and 
recreation, is a difficult one., There is 
the matter of cost and time, and ab- 
sence from regular work, and all kinds 
of kindred problems. 


To the American Negro there comes, 
of course, the additional problem of 
race discrimination in amusement, and 
it comes most awkwardly because when 
one is searching for rest and renewal 
of strength, this is about the last time 
that one wants to settle social prob- 
lems, or indeed to come in contact with 
them. For this reason, American Ne- 
groes for a long time were timid about 
their vacation plans; but of necessity 
they have had more and more to face 
the problem. This is a sort of tenta- 
tive survey of the way in which they 
do it. 

The mass of them, like the mass of 
white folk, stay home in summer as in 
winter for economic reasons. Only, in 
the case of the Negroes, the proportion 
is larger because they are a poorer peo- 
ple. In the South, they are either ex- 
cluded from public parks, or from parts 
of them, like the playgrounds, pools, 
boats, etc. In some cases, separate 
parks have been laid out for Negroes. 
But usually such parks are so bare and 
ugly that they attract few people. 

In some Southern cities, and in most 
Northern cities, the parks are open, 
and the colored people use them to some 
extent for picnics and outings. The 
commercial amusement parks usually 
discriminate a great deal, although col- 
ored people frequent places like Coney 
Island all over the country. 

Curiously enough, Negroes have 
special difficulty about bathing in the 
sea. The reason is obvious, just as there 
is less discrimination in the movies be- 
cause the movies are dark and dark 
skins invisible, so there is more dis- 
crimination in bathing, because more 
dark skin is inevitably visible. 

There is an increasing tendency to 
travel. Several score of Negroes go 
abroad every year, mostly during the 
summer. In latter years, these trips 
have been conducted in several cases in 
groups. Usually, Negroes go singly 
and by couples. They meet some dis- 
crimination. The steamship companies 
try to keep down the proportion of Ne- 
groes so as not to invite opposition. If 
there are more than one or two colored 
folk, they may find themselves segre- 
gated in the dining room. But this dis- 
crimination is not usually very pro- 
nounced, and sometimes is quite un- 
noticeable. In all trips to the West 
Indies there is pronounced discrimina-

tion. On the boats of the United Fruit 
Company it is impossible for an ac- 
knowledged Negro to get a real first- 
class cabin. 


Once abroad, and the black tourist is 
freer. He may find some difficulties in 
the cheaper hotels of London and Paris, 
but for the most part, he can get the 
accommodation that he wishes to pay 
for. In the West Indies, there is more 
discrimination. The newer hotels ca- 
tering to American trade, exclude him 
absolutely. To the other hotels, he is 
usually admitted. 


In the United States, the automo- 
bile has, of course, transformed travel 
for the Negro. The motorcar enables 
him to avoid the wretched “Jim-crow” 
railway cars and widens the circle of 
possibilities for his outing. These pos- 
sibilities, however, are still limited. In 
certain parts of New England, New 
York State, the upper Middle West 
and the Northwest, a colored man 
could tour with his family and find 
accommodation without too great diffi- 
culty. He can use the automobile 
parks; he can put up at many of the 
less pretentious hotels, and, on-~ the 
whole, and unless the numbers are 
large, his difficulties will not be enough 
to spoil the trip. This is even more true 
in Canada, where discrimination would 
be the exception. 


In the lower latitudes of the United 
States, discrimination appears in various 
forms and is met by hotels and boarding 
houses which cater particularly to col- 
ored people. At Oak Bluffs, Martha’s 
Vineyard, there is a hotel and many 
boarding houses which draw a consider- 
able number of the better class of Ne- 
groes. Newport has its colored board- 
ing houses and there are a few in the 
Berkshire Hills. Along the beaches of 
Massachusetts and Connecticut it is 
possible to find good accommodations 
here and there, althought this is not 
always true. In the Adirondacks and 
the Catskills, the ordinary hotels do not 
always discriminate and there are, par- 
ticularly in the Catskills, a few colored 
boarding houses. 

Jersey is always a hot bed of race dis- 
crimination, as it is of other backward 
tendencies. In Spring Lake, Asbury 
Park, Atlantic City and Cape May, 
there are excellent first-class colored 
hotels, clean and not very expensive. 
This has been a development of the 
last five years. 

In all these places, there is difficulty 
about bathing. In Asbury Park, for a 
long time the colored people were con- 
fined in one rather disreputable end of 
the beach, and while this is theoretically 


abolished, still in all Jersey resorts eco- 
nomic retaliation faces the colored peo- 
ple: if they insist upon bathing with 
the white people, the hotels and em- 
ployers regularly threaten to discharge 
their colored help. 


The situation in’ this respect is pe- 
culiarly acute in Atlantic City. For a 
while, ten years ago, it was impossible 
for a Negro to put his foot in the 
ocean; then there came a colored ho- 
tel, Wall’s, where excellent bathing 
accommodations could be had. When 
this was bought out, owing to natural 
expansion, the Negroes began to bathe 
where they wished. Today, they bathe 
mainly at certain points near Indiana 
Avenue; but the city is very much 
exercised over this and wants to put up 
a special Negro bath house. But where 
should this bath house be? Nobody 
can decide; especially the real estate 
interests cannot make up their minds. 


Maryland gets its outings on Chesa- 
peake Bay, chiefly by boat rides and 
boarding houses in the hills. The Dis- 
trict us: Columbia has a beautiful cot- 
tage city at Arundel. Virginia has one 
hotel at Buckroe Beach near Hamp- 
ton. From Virginia South to Florida, 
there is practically no place for colored 
people to find summer amusement, ex- 
cept the hotel at Ashville in North 
Carolina. The mass of the city folks 
in the Carolinas, Georgia and Ala- 
bama, may go out to the country here 
and there, but the lawlessness of the 
country whites, and their dislike of see- 
ing a Negro dressed up, makes that 
often an unpleasant pastime. 

On the Gulf Coast, there is Gulf- 
side, Mississippi, a summer resort es- 
tablished by Bishop Jones of the M. E. 
Church. New Orleans Negroes are 
practically shut out from the sea and 
parks and the same seems to be true in 
Texas. The more well-to-do Negroes 
of this part of the country come North 
in their automobiles during the sum- 
mer, going to the colored hotels on the 
Jersey Coast, or touring the far North, 
or visiting the boarding houses in Har- 
pers Ferry and in the Virginia and 
West Virginia mountains. 

Kentucky and Tennessee, Arkansas, 
Oklahoma and Missouri have no par- 
ticular summer resorts for colored peo- 
ple save as they visit each other, or go 
to farms, or tour outside their districts. 
In winter and spring, Arkansas has two 
excellent hotels and bath houses at Hot 
Springs. The Middle West has its 
greatest single resort at Idlewild, a 
Michigan resort that has been de- 
veloped around a lake, with hotels, cot-

@ It is said that the Socialist Party 
of Belgium is investing money in 
Congo concessions in somewhat the 
same way as the Locomotive Engineers 
in America experimented in capital- 
ism. 

@ During the year 1928, boats from 
the Belgian Congo landed at Antwerp, 
120,112 tons of Congo produce worth 
534,404,000 francs. In 1924, only 
64,000 tons were imported, and in 
1927, 106,000 tons. The chief Congo 
products brought to Antwerp were, 
according to value, palm nuts, cot- 
ton, copal gum, palm oil, ivory, rub- 
ber, sesame seeds. In addition to this, 
there are the mineral products, which 
amount to nearly as many tons, and 
there are the products shipped to other 
places beside Antwerp. 


AMERICA 
@ The Literary Digest says: 

The black belt now extends around the 
world. Art, letters, music, and culture 
of the twentieth century are all pro- 
foundly influenced by the Negro, the 
American Negro in particular, according 
to Joseph Chapiro, who announces his 
discovery in the Berliner Tageblatt. His 
influence is increasingly felt on the artis- 
tic plane no less than in the political 
sphere. The American Negro, exclaims 
the German observer, has an influence 


that is “cosmical as well as comical 
And he is becoming conscious of his 
emerging power. 


@ Roland Hayes has completed his 
Fifth tour of America, and had the 
distinction, shared with Fritz Kreisler 
alone, of appearing three times in Car- 
negie Hall. He will return for his 
sixth tour next November. The Bos- 
ton Globe says: 


“No mere voice, no matter how phen- 
omenal, would ever draw and hold audi- 
ences Roland Hayes has won. The mar- 
velous thing about him is the almost 
unique combination of emotional inten- 
sity and fastidious taste which disting- 
uishes his singing. He is at once the 
most genuinely aristocratic artist now 
before American public, and the most 
genuinely emotional singer. What he 
does always comes from the heart, and 
goes to the heart. 


@ The Federated Colored Catholics 
of the United States comprise about

@ Thirty-three cities were studied 
with an aggregate population of 920,-

terprises numbered 2,817, employing 
17,697 persons. Of the enterprises, 
19% were grocery stores, 14% barber 
shops, 11-3/10% cleaning places and 
tailoring establishments, 11% _ restau- 
rants, while 6% each were drugstores 
and auto mechanics. Forty-four and 
six-tenths percent of these shops do an 
annual volume of business of $5,000 or 
above. Twenty-six percent do an an- 
nual business of $10,000 or over.

@ The Allied Arts Players of Boston, 


under the direction of Maude Cuney 
Hare, have presented three plays: ‘““The 
No ’Count Boy’, by Paul Green, “The 
Boor”, by Tchekoff, “The Festival of 
the Resurrection of Adonis’, by Theo- 
critus. 


@ The Boston Herald says: 

Three plays were given at the Fine 
Arts Theatre last night by the Allied 
Arts Players. The direction, action, 
costuming, and settings of these plays 
were excellent, considering that they 
were entirely the work of an amateur 
organization. But because the Allied 
Arts Players are amateurs in the truest 
sense of the word, they have much in- 





deed to bring to their productions— 
freshness, spontaneity, a taste for the best 
plays, and a sure sense of characteriza- 
tion that seldom fails even the most in- 
experienced player. For these reasons 
their program last night was very worth 
while, and a large audience showed, by 
much applause, how much their efforts 
were appreciated. 

@ The state Education Department 
of the State of New York, has ruled 
that the word ‘Negro’ must be 
spelled with a capital letter. 

@ John A. O’Brien, an undertaker 
of Boston, Massachusetts, has pre- 
sented a memorial window to the Epis- 
copal Church of which the Reverend 
LeRoy Ferguson is rector. The win- 
dow is in memory of his mother, who 


died in the West Indies last year at 
the age of 98. 


@ Mrs. N. R. Waters of Wyoming 
failed to receive a first prize in Music 
at a Boston competition for a curious 
reason: 

According to the rules laid down by 
the federation members in the South and 
West, where race prejudice against Col- 
ored people is strong, a Colored singer, 
even if allowed to win in preliminaries 
in New England, would not be allowed 
to compete in finals, consequently it is 
thought best not to award first place 
to a colored person, whether he or she 
deserves it or not.

@ At the Dunbar Theatre in Phila- 
delphia, Miss Nannie H. Burroughs 
staged a pageant “When Truth Gets

School for Women and Girls. It 
aroused enthusiasm in the audience. 

@ James Sanders, a Negro chauffeur, 
near Philadelphia ran into the car of 
E. T. Stotesbury and Mrs. George 
Willing, two prominent and rich Phil-

would be railroaded to jail, and indeed, 
Stotesbury’s white chauffeur was not 
even arrested. Nevertheless, the jury 
acquitted the colored man of all inten- 
tional harm, without leaving the box.

@ The Cleveland Clinic fire produced 
a Negro hero in the person of Walter 
B. Jackson, a garage attendant, who 
worked next door. Jackson held a 
ladder on his shoulders when it was 
found too short to reach an_ upper- 
story window of the Clinic, and twelve 
persons were rescued thereby. Every 
newspaper lauded him. John Love, in 
the Cleveland Plain Dealer, says: 

When I read that Walter B. Jackson 
had held a short ladder on his shoulders 
to rescue people escaping from the Clinic 
fire, and that he and one other had saved 
twelve persons, I was reminded of an- 
other colored man, Lionel Licorish, who 
saved twenty in the sinking of the Ves- 
tris. 

In the first Florida tornado there was 
a colored boy who stood on a bridge near 
Lake Okeechobee and was reported to 
have taken seventeen children out of the 
water as they were washed past him, 
saving most or all of them. 

These three saw trouble, rushed in, 
forgot about themselves and made not 
ordinary rescues but rescues on a grand 
scale.

@ Lincoln Congregational Temple 
on the corner of 11th and “R” Street, 
Washington, D. C., was purchased by 
the American Missionary Society in 
1868. On this site, a building familiar 
to many of the older visitors of Wash- 
ington was erected. It was known 
as the Lincoln mission. Here in 1880, 
the Lincoln Memorial Church was 
started and among its pastors were the 
Reverend George W. Moore, Rever- 
end Eugene Johnson, and Reverend A. 
P. Miller. In 1901, the church was 
united to Park Temple under the Rev- 
erend Sterling N. Brown. The Rev- 
erend Emory B. Smith came to the 
charge in 1915, and finally in 1923, 
the Reverend R. W. Brooks. Under 
Mr. Brooks has recently been erected 
the new church shown in our illustra- 
tion. The building was completed 
February, 1929, at a cost of $120,000, 
with furniture. It seats 1,200 people 
and has a Men’s Club, Ladies’ Parlor, 
kitchen and roof garden.

Dr. R. Nathaniel Dett, there has been 
recently developed at Hampton a re- 
markable Institute Choir. The Choir 
first gained notoriety at the Music Fes- 
tival in the Library of Congress, Wash-

comed the native chiefs and delegates. 
The Bishop of Bloenfontein, Dr. W. 
J. Carey, officially opened the Con- 
gress, and urged an appeal to General 
Hertzog “‘to heal, not to hurt the soul 
of the native people.” He declared 
that on account of lack of education, 
not 1 “ of the natives were fit for the 
franchise. A native woman, Mrs: 
Classen, answered the Bishop, and de- 
clared that “the appalling ignorance 
of our people to which his Lordship re- 
ferred, was to a large extent encour- 
aged and abetted by the state.” She 
said also that syphilis and drunkenness 
were brought by the Europeans to the 
Bantu.

THE AMERICAN FEDERA- 
TION OF LABOR AND 
THE NEGRO 


HE speech of J. P. Frey at the 
National Inter-racial Conference 
last December on “Attempts to Organ- 
ize Negro Workers” has given rise to 
some controversy. Walter White in 
the Nation characterizes this speech 
as “the nadir in casuistic defense of ex- 
clusion of Negroes from labor unions.” 
To this characterization Frey ob- 
jects, but admits “I failed to accom- 
plish one purpose I had in mind—the 
presentation of a careful program.” 

But this was not the real essence of 
Frey’s failure. His whole thesis was: 
Negroes suffer from injustice in the 
labor union world, but they do not 
suffer much more than Jews, Poles and 
even Americans. Moreover, they are 
partially to blame because they do not 
advise their workers to enter the trade 
unions even where they can. 

This latter point Frey sought to em- 
phasize in every way. He cited Booker 
T. Washington, and his advice to the 
iron workers of Newport News; he 
cited the resolution of the Negro Press 
Association; and he even went so far 
as to declare: 

“T have asked representatives of the 
Negro race, some of the best known, 
to make some public statement or write 
me a letter in which they would say 
it was their belief that wherever pos- 
sible members of their race should join 
the trade union of their craft, so that 
I could use that statement or letter 
to help me in the efforts I have made 
to organize Negroes. So far no such 
statement or letter has been received.” 

This whole thesis is untrue and un- 
fair. The record of the American 
Federation of Labor toward the Negro 
is indefensible. An early declaration 
ot the A. F. of L. said: 

“The working people must unite and 
organize, irrespective of creed, color, 
sex, nationality or politics.” With 
some objection, this declaration was re- 
affirmed in 1897, but it was not em- 
bodied in the Constitution. Neverthe- 
less, bodies confining membership to 
whites were barred from affiliation 
with the A. F. of L. Later, in 1902, 
the legality of excluding Negroes from 
local unions, and from city central la- 


July, 1929 


bor bodies was recognized by a resolu- 
tion which permitted separate charters 
to colored unions. Later, without of- 
ficial announcement, national unions, 
like the Railway Trainmen, and the 
Railway ‘Telegraphers, which  spe- 
cifically exclude Negroes, were allowed 
to join the A. F. of L.; and finally, 
the Stationary Engineers, already a 
member of the A. F. of L. were al- 
lowed to change their charter and spe- 
cifically exclude black men. 

In addition to this, it is well-known 
that even in the case of organizations 
which do not openly and by name ex- 
clude persons of Negro descent, the 
local unions repeatedly do this as a 
matter of regular policy without re- 


buke from the A. F. of L. 


The National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People has 
long recognized the danger of this sit- 
uation and at its 15th Annual Con- 
ference held in Philadelphia, in July, 
1924, the following Resolution was 
addressed to the A. F. of L.: 

“For many years the American Ne- 
gro has been demanding admittance to 
the ranks of union labor. 

“For many years your organizations 
have made public profession of your 
interest in Negro labor, of your de- 
sire to have it unionized, and of your 
hatred of the black ‘scab’. 

“Notwithstanding this apparent sur- 
face agreement, Negro labor in the 
main is outside the ranks of organized 
labor, and the reason is first, that white 
union labor does not want black la- 
bor, and secondly, black labor has 
ceased to beg admittance to union 
ranks because of its increasing value 
and efficiency outside the unions. 

“We thus face a crisis in interracial 
labor conditions: the continued and de- 
termined race prejudice of white labor, 
together with the limitation of immi- 
gration, is giving black labor tremen- 
dous advantage. The Negro is enter- 
ing the ranks of semi-skilled and skilled 
labor and he is entering mainly as a 
‘scab’. He broke the great steel 
strike. He will soon be in a position 
to break any strike when he can gain 
economic advantage for himself. 

“On the other hand, intelligent Ne- 
groes know full well that a blow at 
organized labor is a blow at all labor; 


that black labor today profits by the 
blood and sweat of labor leaders in the 
past who have fought oppression and 
monopoly by organization. If there is 
built up in America a great black bloc 
of non-union laborers who have a right 
to hate unions, all laborers, black and 
white, eventually must suffer. 

“Ts it not time, then, that black and 
white labor get together? Is it not 
time for white unions to stop bluffing 
and for black laborers to stop cutting 
off their noses to spite their faces? 

“We, therefore, propose that there 
be formed by the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored Peo- 
ple, the American Federation of La- 
bor, the Railway Brotherhoods and any 
other bodies agreed upon, an_ Inter- 
racial Labor Commission. 

“We propose that this Commission 
undertake: 

1. To find out the exact attitude and 
practice of national labor bodies 
and local unions toward Negroes 
and of Negro labor toward unions. 
To organize systematic propaganda 
against racial discrimination on the 
basis of these facts at the labor 
meetings, in local assemblies and in 
local unions. 

“The National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People stands 
ready to take part in such a movement 
and hereby invites the co-operation of 
all organized labor. The Association 
hereby solemnly warns American la- 
borers that unless some such step as this 
is taken and taken soon the position 
gained by organized labor in this coun- 
try is threatened with irreparable loss.” 

Beside perfunctory acknowledgment 
of receipt, no action has ever been 
taken on this resolution by the Ameri- 
can Federation of Labor. This is a 
sufficient answer to Frey’s awkward 
and insincere defense of the color line 


in the A. F. of L.

GOVERNMENT BY GRAFT 
HROUGHOUT this country in 


nation, state and city, government 
by which individuals get immunity or 
privilege by paying sums of money to 
officials is a widespread and openly 
recognized method of administration. 


241 
















Not only has there been the open scan- 
dal of the oil cases, but the tremendous 
graft of the war period has not begun 
to be revealed simply because no one 
had the heart to contemplate it. The 
thing goes on in everyday life! Graft 
to the policeman who threatens to ar- 
rest the automobile speeder; graft to 
the alderman, who secures a permit for 
the newsstand; graft to the city coun- 
cil who awards a contract to favored 
persons; graft to the members of the 
Legislature who grant valuable char- 
ters; graft to judges, municipal, state 
and federal, who grant immunity from 
punishment, not simply in bankruptcy 
cases, but in others. We do not like 
to confess this. We maintain firmly 
that there is no direct bribery in politi- 
cal life in America, and yet our politi- 
cal campaigns call for millions upon 
millions of money. 


Against this system, it is idle to 
think that the black man will be im- 
mune. He is human and American. 
He cannot be expected to rise far 
above his surroundings. Recently, a 
councilman in Cleveland, Ohio, has 
been sentenced to jail for petty graft. 
There seems to be no doubt that he 
was guilty but he was doing exactly 
what the majority of his fellow coun- 
cilman still do; he was following out 
the system which he took over at his 
party’s dictation. 

Notwithstanding all this, we have 
got to evolve in the United States 
honest Negro politicians, voters and of- 
fice holders, who stand against the 
trend of their white neighbors. THE 
Crisis had hoped that the new colored 
woman voter was going to lead in this 
respect. We have been disappointed. 
The petty graft among colored wo- 
men political leaders has been more 
shameful because less excuseable than 
among the men. We must, therefore, 
look to our Youth, male and female, 
and ask that some young colored peo- 
ple gird themselves to go into political 
life, not for the sake of illicit gain, but 
for the sake of doing a job for Democ- 
racy. 

What finer field opens to us? Not 
healing, nor justice, teaching, preach- 
ing, writing, singing nor painting, of- 
fers a career fraught with more tre- 
mendous results. Democracy today 
throughout the world is at bay. It has 
been attacked in the house of its 
friends. It is being sneered at and de- 
cried by the best leadership in Amer- 
ica, France and England. 

The darker races are the ones and 
apparently the only ones to lead the 
world out of this morass. The foun- 
dation logic of Democracy is as strong 
today as it ever was. Why can we not 
have a young man of Harlem to run 
for office on a practical program and a 


242 





promise, on his word of honor, to obey 
the commandment: “Thou shalt not 
steal?” Why can we not have a young 
woman in Chicago who would go to 
the Board of Alderman and even to 
Congress on a platform which refuses 
to make alliance with gambling, prosti- 
tution and bootlegging, and which lays 
down one clear political plank? “Thou 
Shalt Not Bear False Witness Against 
Thy Neighbor’? Is this too much to 
ask for? Is it too wild a dream? 


Of course, one ought to hope in such 
a movement to secure the alliance, sym- 
pathy and backing of white liberals 
but too many of them are the first to 
draw the Color Line. 


ROLAND HAYES WAITS 


HE music critic of the New York 
World got quite fussed up be- 
cause Roland Hayes, before singing, 
waited for his audience to get still. I, 
who sat and listened, found this pause 
most striking and symptomatic. Ameri- 
cans are terribly ill bred when it comes 
to music. Let a young lady be asked 
to play the piano for the assembled 
company, and at her first note, every- 
body begins to talk. The only way in 
which a cabaret soloist can sing suc- 
cessfully is to out-screech his yelling au- 
dience. And even a trained audience, 
like that vast mass at Carnegie Hall 
last Sunday, apparently has to do just 
so much whispering and twisting and 
squirming, not to mention slipping in 
from one to ten minutes late, before 
it can settle down to listen to a beau- 
tiful voice. So Roland Hayes waited. 
It was really extraordinary. Two 
thousand people—a little village—flut- 
tered, coughed, moved, and then slowly 
and gradually, like a great cloud broken 
by waving streamlets of sound, here 
and there, settled down; and then at 
last there was silence. Then there was 
Song. 
I hope that Roland Hayes will con- 
tinue to teach Americans manners. 


MORE COMMENTS 


Hartford, Connecticut. 

As a white subscriber to your valued 
periodical would say that I am sur- 
prised that there should have been any 
criticism of the article “Dark Lover” 
by Rheba Cain. Any person who is 
interested in the work you are doing 
must perforce believe in racial equal- 
ity, which involves the right to freely 
intermarry. If the darker races are 
mentally and physically equal to the 
white, what logical objection can there 
be to intermarriage? 


I also desire to commend your 
thoughful review of a most informa- 
tive book, Nearing’s “Black America.” 





This book should be placed in every 
library in the country. I believe the 
Negro race will come to see that bour- 
geois democracy offers them little, but 
that a proletarian dictatorship like that 
of Russia is the only means to freedom 
from economic and social bondage. 


South Carolina. 
I’m returning to you the May issue 
of THE Crisis. I find that sentiment 
here is too strong against it. Being 
one who caters to the white people for 
patronage, I find that it would be 
against me to handle it longer. 


Newark, New Jersey. 
I have just read your article on 
“The Students at Lincoln” in the cur- 
rent edition of THE Crisis. 


I want to thank you personally for 
your comments, and I am sure that ev- 
ery Lincoln Alumnus will feel under 
some obligation to you for stating the 
case at Lincoln in the manner you did. 
What happened there cannot merit 
more than a semblance of an apology 
for Lincoln, that being the fact that 
it was purely a student action, with- 
out either the suggestion, guidance or 
knowledge of the Faculty, as far as I 
am able to learn. 


It is our hope, therefore, that people 
who justly condemn this student folly 
will not at the same time, let anything 
enter into their criticism which would 
be condemnatory of the Faculty at 
Lincoln, or the policy of its present 
Trustee Board. 

It is, I agree, a very difficult matter 
to write about without some reference 
to the Faculty. It must be further 
conceded, I think, that your interpre- 
tation of what they have not done, is, 
in reality, one of the aspects of the 
case. But there is another side which, 
it seems to me, to be nearer the truth. 
It strikes me that there isn’t a single 
living Lincoln graduate who would 
not affirm that there is not to be found 
any where in the world today a group 
of white men who are more thoroughly 
convinced of both the accomplishments 
as well as the present and future po- 
tentialities of the Negro. Indeed, this 
fact, in a very large measure at least, 
accounts for the lack of any expressed 
agitation on the part of the Alumni 
for the very thing which you now say 
ought to be, and doubtless will be: a 
mixed Faculty. Well do I- remember 
the Rendalls who inspired us to a be- 
lief in ourselves. Well too, do I re- 
member Professor George Johnson, 
the present dean of the college, who, 
very often in his classes in philosophy, 
would digress and talk to us for almost 
a full period on the Negro and the 
necessity of our development of a race

NEGRO JOURNALISM 


YOUNG writer sends us the 
following letter: 

“It has always been my ambition to 
be a journalist. That I might qualify, 
I went to Lincoln University, which I 
finished last June and have studied 
much on the side. I am not easily dis- 
heartened at anything I attempt to do, 
but there are some features of this 
journalistic game that I must contend 
with that I hate. No wonder that my 
father disowned me for not taking 
medicine instead. A Negro journalist 
who is in a sense different from a pure 
journalist must contend with certain 
standards that try his convictions. For 
instance, | attempted to write for the 
Illustrated Feature Section of the 
Pittsburgh Courier and was in turn 
rebuked for being literary instead of 
‘writing down’ to a standard main- 
tained by the New York American. I 
was also told that every sentence must 
be a paragraph. 

“A little over a year ago, I sub- 
mitted a short story to you which you 
at that time accepted, but so far it has 
not appeared in print. In the light of 
these facts must I conclude, as the 
masses are prone to believe, that you 
can not depend on your own race peo- 
ple for help in your endeavor? It is 
also true that white correspondents of 
mine have given me more encourage- 
ment than colored, and sometimes I 
feel like keeping my color a secret and 
write as a white person, ignoring what 
should be written about Negroes. 
Probably when I tell you I am twenty- 
three you may assume as others do that 
I am just a foolish lad pursuing a will- 
of-wisp. 

“Being iconoclastic in my way of 
thinking, I realize what opposition will 
be mine among a conservative people. I 
read with amusement the criticisms 
heaped upon Eugene Gordon because 
he exposed the superficiality to which 
members of my race are prone. And 
if I criticize any feature because I love 
truth more than anything else, it means 
I cannot be a successful Negro jour- 
nalist and I will have to resort to 
other things that I might live. I am 
hoping that in the future there will be 
outlets for literary expression in Negro 
periodicals as there are opportunities 
in white periodicals. With regret that 
I have consumed much of your busy 
time, I am 

Apologetically yours,” 

This letter illustrates a widely prev- 
alent point of view. A young colored 
person wishes to write. He sends his 
articles to a colored periodical. They 
are not published. He immediately 
assumes: (1) that he can write; (2), 


244 


that the public is willing to read what- 
ever a writer sincerely thinks; (3), 
that colored Editors are unfair and en- 
vious; (4), that if the writer were 
white or wrote for white periodicals, 
he would find none of these _hin- 
drances. 


The real facts are quite different. It 
is trite to say that the wish to write 
and the ability to write are not syn- 
onymous terms; and again an article 
which greatly pleases its writer may 
not please the reader; and the reason 
for this may be that the article is not 
well written or not clearly written or 
that the reader does not like its con- 
clusions. It is hard for the young 
writer to realize the great guiding dis- 
covery of modern journalism: that it is 
what the public demands and not what 
the prophet preaches that in the end 
determines publication, circulation and 
success. 

This is as true of white Editors as 
of colored. If the public taste has 
been debauched and lowered, fed upon 
crime and sensation, and _ personal 
tittle-tattle, the Editor who has ideals 
and who represents a cause, follows a 
dificult and dangerous path. And if 
he persists in publishing articles just 
because he and their writers think the 
articles are good, he is liable to find 
that his newspaper or magazine has 
ceased publication. During the 18 
years in which THe Crisis has been 
published the number of new Negro 
magazines which have been born, flour- 
ished and died, have averaged one a 
year—eighteen in all. The Editor, 
therefore, grows cautious. It is diffi- 
cult for him to know just what his 
public appreciates and his printer’s bill 
limits inexorably the number of ex- 
periments that he can make. 

The young writer. on the other 
hand, is not satisfied with writing that 
merely pleases; he wants to assert his 
opinion, his interpretation of the world; 
he wants to slash, criticise and reform 
a rotten world, and he assumes that 
what he wants to say is just what the 
world is waiting to hear. But in 
truth this is exactly what the vast ma- 
jority of men will not listen to. They 
will not support the papers that print 
frank criticism. Whenever THE 
Crisis dares to print a word of criti- 
cism or belief of school, church or 
man, the bitterness, resentment and evi- 
dent deep hurt of those touched is as- 
tonishing. It is not a question of truth 
but of daring to tell it. Most readers 
resent criticism; they want praise and 
bombast and crime and gossip and blah. 
They want the Saturday Evening Post 
and the New York Journal and the 
tabloids and they get them. 

What then shall the Editor, white 
and colored, who wants to print the 
truth and speed just criticism, do? 


First of all, he cannot print all the 
writings of the young just because they 
are sincere. Most of the opinions and 
judgments of most young folk in most 
ages of the world are not worth the 
paper they are written on. But some 
are and this grain of wheat in all the 
chaff, the honest Editor seeks to save. 
But if he saves it and bankrupts his 
periodical, what has he gained but 
new readers for the Penny Dreadfuls? 


The young writer who fails of pub- 
lication becomes naturally discouraged 
and bitter. He thinks that he is not 
appreciated; that his race is going to 
Hell, and that all Editors are fools. 
Colored Editors, it is true, have their 
full share of stupidity, envy and other 
all too human traits; but at any rate, 
they are at least sensible enough to 
want to publish what their public will 
read; and some of them even want to 
go further and publish what the pub- 
lic ought to read and don’t. The 
young writer decides, however, with 
our correspondent, to deprive the Ne- 
gro race of the benefit of his talents 
and to turn to the white world. What 
will he find there? Exactly the same 
conditions, except more so. Of course, 
the number of editors is larger, and 
the reading public wider, more varied, 
and of higher average intelligence. For 
this very reason the competition is 
keener and the chances for new young 
writers correspondingly smaller. The 
chance of a young white writer saying 
what he wishes to say is indeed much 
smaller than in the case of a Negro. 
On the other hand, success, if it comes, 
is necessarily much greater and more 
extravagantly rewarded. This makes 
the temptation to sell one’s soul for 
cash more irresistible for whites than 
for blacks. 

The Editor’s job then is not simply 
that of determining whether or not a 
writer has ability and honesty, or 
whether or not his article deserves pub- 
lication. No such simple problem con- 
fronts an Editor. Granted that the 
article shows merit, the Editor’s real 
problem is: Will the public read it? 
The Editor has, of course, some lead- 
ership here. He can train his readers 
to some extent. He can set certain 
standards. But few people, lamenta- 
bly few, realize how little an Editor 
with the best will can do in this line. 
The taste of his reading public has 
been set by forces far beyond him, and 
he is compelled to a certain extent to 
follow the lines which the current pub-

One thing, however, and one tre- 
mendous thing the young colored writ-

when he turns to a white public he 
surrenders partially or entirely the chief 
reason for his writing, which is the

New York’s Committee 
(Continued from page 229) 


years our Education Committee has 
done effective work in helping to de- 
velop a consciousness for the N. A. A. 
C. P. in New York City. Last year 
that Committee sponsored two after- 
noon teas at which the National Off- 
cers and many friends of the Associa- 
tion of both races, were present. First 
they presented Mr. and Mrs. Clarence 
Darrow and at least five hundred per- 
sons attended. Then later, they pre- 
sented Mrs. Nella Larsen Imes, as a 
new writer and author of her first 
novel “Quicksand.” 

The money for these meetings is 
given by the women of the Committee, 
each member being taxed a certain 
amount and no admission is charged. 

On May 15th of this year, they gave 
a reception for Mr. Walter White, the 
Assistant Secretary of the N. A. A. 
C. P. We wished to pay tribute to 
Mr. White, who represents the newer 
group of writers, because of his recent 
publication “Rope and Faggott,” and 
also to create an interest in his books 
which were on sale that evening, along 
with the spring publications of other 
Negro writers. These publications 
were arranged on _ attractive book 
tables and as copies were sold, they 
were autographed by the authors, who 
were present. 


We are deeply incerested in the pro- 
ductions of the New Negro—the 
younger writers and artists and hope 
to encourage and develop a finer appre- 
ciation of their work by presenting 
them to the public in an intimate and 
friendly manner. We hope from year 
to year to present other persons of both 
races who have made worthy contribu- 
tions to art, literature, music, the sci- 
ences and particularly those whose sub- 
jects deal directly and honestly with 
the Negro. 

We have tried very earnestly to in- 
terest New Yorkers in the general pro- 
gram of the National Association and 
to bring about a better understanding 
among the various groups of both races. 

Since May 1924, our Committee has 
raised for the National Association 
$16,290.92; that includes the $2,048, 
netted on our Spring Dance, which 
was given on March 25th of this year. 
This was our most successful benefit.

Mr. Aaron Douglas, one of the most 
brilliant artists of the younger group. 
The design for our front page was re- 
produced on the cover of the Crisis 
for April. Our entertainment was 
planned and presented by Mr. Bill 
Robinson, famous tap dancer, known 
as ‘Bojangles’ and some of New 
York’s most distinguished persons were 
present to enjoy the program which 
featured stars from “Blackbirds” and 
our smartest night clubs. The admis- 
sion was raised to two dollars for this 
occasion since it was to be a special 
feature of the Twentieth Anniversary 
Campaign in New York City. 

Between seasons cake sales, rum- 
mage sales and card parties have been 
sponsored by members to help defray 
certain expenses and each year Mrs. 
Marion Beasley makes candy to be 
sold at the dances. It is packed in 
attractively hand painted boxes and 
this year at our Spring Dance, Mrs. 
Beasley cleared $85.00 on the sale of 
her candy. We encourage our mem- 
bers to promote these individual efforts 
in order that the proceeds may be used 
to underwrite our large affairs, which 
we hope to give at least twice a year. 

I think the secret of our success is 
that we have never failed to live up to 
our promises to the public. We have 
never failed to present what we have 
advertised in advance. Details are care- 
fully and thoughtfully worked out for 
the comfort of our guests, sometimes at 
a loss for us, but always our public 
must be happy and well pleased. 

For the past two years during my 
administration as Chairman I have 
tried to develop a closer association be- 
tween the National Office and our 
Committee. It seemed to me that with 
a more intimate relationship the wo- 
men would become more deeply con- 
cerned in the program of the National 
Association, be more aware of their 
needs and thereby wish to assume a 
very definite and serious responsibility 
through the medium of their commit- 
tee. 

We have not always known success 
in our various undertakings. At times 
we have been desperately unhappy over 
a lack of response and enthusiasm from 
our members and the public. But al- 
ways there were a few of us who held 
on, feeling that we could not leave the 
National Office without a supporting 
Committee in New York. I think 
there are those among us’ who have 
caught the great spirit of the Associa- 
tion’s work, some who are deeply 
aware of its tremendous value. If we 
can pass that appreciativeness of its 
worth on to those to whom we wish to 
appeal, I believe that our Women’s 
Committee will have proven itself to 
be of real service to the National Of- 
fice.

Captain Floyd 
(Continued from page 231) 


‘We have decorated Captain James 
W. Floyd of the tug ‘Dauntless’, be- 
cause he, like the name of the craft he 
commanded, was fearless and daring; 
because in spite of the Federal Navy, 
in spite of the Spanish Men of War, 
in spite of adverse conditions and under 
any kind of weather, he conducted one 
after another, several expeditions to 
Cuba and supplied our men with those 
things they needed most—food, arms, 
clothing and munitions. Gentlemen, 
Captain J. W. Floyd of the ‘Dauntless’ 
is as much of a Cuban patriot as those 
who, with the arms he took in his tug, 
fought the Spaniards in our country.” 


N. A. A. C. P. Battle Front

good deal of certain of the people who 
have directed it. I take the letterhead 
of their stationery and I remember 
sume of the people who are mentioned 
thereon as officers or directors, or 
whatever you may call it, of the As- 
sociation. There is the Reverend John 
Haynes Holmes—perhaps the first man 
in all of New York City to conduct a 
great church in which the purpose is 
not the Fear of God but the Love of 
Man. There is Oswald Garrison Vil- 
lard, who has made successful the one 
iree liberal weekly in America. There 
is J. E. Spingarn—if this were Ger- 
many I should give him his proper 
title of Major Dr. Prof. Spingarn— 
who is the first man who introduced 
into America the study of literature not 
as a segregated New England phe- 
nomenon but as a world factor. There 
is James Weldon Johnson, who, along 
with Carl Sandburg, has given to 
America the realization that we have 
here a native beauty and a native music 
comparable to the best in Europe. 
There is Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois, who 
is almost the only man I have ever met 
in twenty countries whose sense of 
humor is equal to his scholarship. 
There is Walter White, whom I have 
put last in this list because he is one 
of the best friends that I have. That 
I have praised Mr. White’s novels is 
less important than the fact of my ad- 
miration for him as a charming—and 
rather curiously heroic—human being. 

So this is all that I have to say 
about the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People—that 
I know of no organization in the world 
for whose leaders I have so much ad- 
miration.

ment of Colored People my sincerest 
felicitations upon the occasion of the 
Twentieth Anniversary of the Society. 

The Association is looking back 
upon two decades of excellent service 
done in a most deserving cause. None 
of the many groups that constitute the 
conglomerate picture of our population 
has had a harder road to travel than 
the colored people. To none of them 
ought we to feel a deeper responsibil- 
ity and a keener desire to relieve their 
fate than to our colored fellow citizens. 

The Association has rendered yeo- 
man service in aiding our colored peo- 
ple when in distress and in blazing the 
way for a better recognition of their 
rights. I hope that in the next dec- 
ades the Association will continue its 
beneficent work with the same success 
as it has achieved in the past.

lutionary War, and through him she 
might join the D. A. R. But she asked 
“confidentially”, could that matter of 
“his—er—color be left out?” 

Walter White in ‘Flight’ records 
the facts of an excursion of a New 
Orleans girl from the colored race to 
the white race and back again. Jessie 
Fauset in “Plum Bun” considers the 
spiritual experiences and rewards of 
such an excursion, but the story: of the 
excursion fades into unimportance be- 
side that historical document of the 
description of a colored Philadelphia 
family. That characterization ought 
to live in literature. 

Nella Larsen attempts quite a dif- 
ferent thing. She explains just what 
“passing” is: the psychology of the 
thing; the reaction of it on friend and 
enemy. It is a difficult task, but she at- 
tacks the problem fearlessly and with 
consummate art. The great problem is 
under what circumstances would a per- 
son take a step like this and how would 
they feel about it? And how would 
their fellows feel? 

So here is the story: Irene, who is 
faintly colored, is faint with shopping. 
She goes to a hotel roof for rest and 
peace and tea. That’s all. Far from 
being ashamed of herself, she is proud 
of her dark husband and lovely boys. 
Moreover, she is deceiving no one. If 
they wish to recognize her as Spanish, 
then that is their good fortune or mis- 
fortune. She is resting and getting cool 
and drinking tea. Then suddenly she 
faces an entirely different kind of prob- 
lem. She sees Clare and Clare recog- 
nizes her and pounces on her. Clare 
is brilliantly beautiful. She is colored 
in a different way. She has been rather 
brutally kicked into the white world, 
and has married a white man, almost 
in self-defense. She has a daughter,

but she is lonesome and eyes her play- 
mate Irene with fierce joy. Here is the 
plot. Its development is the reaction 
of the race-conscious Puritan, Irene; 
the lonesome hedonist, Clare; and then 
the formation of the rapidly developing 
triangle with the cynical keen rebel, 
Irene’s husband. 

If the American Negro renaissance 
gives us many more books like this, 
with its sincerity, its simplicity and 
charm, we can soon with equanimity 
drop the word “Negro”. Meantime, 
your job is clear. Buy the book. 


The Blacker the Berry 


IT is a little difficult to judge fairly 
Wallace Thurman’s “The Blacker the 
Berry”. Its theme is one of the most 
moving and tragic of our day. The first 
chapter states it clearly: 

“Emma Lou had been born in a semi- 
white world, totally surrounded by an 
all-white one, and those few dark ele- 
ments that had forced their way in had 
either been shooed away or else greeted 
with derisive laughter. It was the cus- 
tom always of those with whom she 
came into most frequent contact to ridi- 
cule or revile any black person or object.” 

Here is the plight of a soul who 
suffers not alone from the color line, 
as we usually conceive it, but from the 
additional evil prejudice, which the 
dominant ideals of a white world create 
within the Negro world itself. The 
author has one passage which will make 
every colored reader thrill: 

““Emma Lou Morgan.’ 

“The principal had called her name 
again, more sharply than before and his 
smile was less benevolent. The girl who 
sat to the left of her nudged her. There 
was nothing else for her to do but to get 
out of that anchoring chair and march 
forward to receive her diploma. But why 
did the people in the audience have to 
stare so? Didn’t they all know that 
Emma Lou Morgan was Boise High 
School’s only nigger student? Didn't 
they all know—but what was the use. 
She had to go get that diploma, so sum- 
moning her most insouciant manner, she 
advanced to the platform center, brought 
every muscle of her lithe limbs into play, 
haughtily extended her shiny black arm 
to receive the proffered diploma, bowed a 
chilly thanks, then holding her arms 
stiffly at her sides, insolently returned to 
her seat in that forboding white line.” 

This is the theme, but excellent as 
is the thought and statement, the 
author does not rise to its full develop- 
ment. The experience of this black 
girl at the University is well done, but 
when she gets to Harlem she fades into 
the background and becomes a string 
upon which to hang an almost trite 
description of black Harlem. 

The story of Emma Lou calls for 
genius to develop it. It needs deep psy- 
chological knowledge and pulsing sym- 
pathy. And above all, the author must

believe in black folk, and in the beauty 
of black as a color of human skin. I 
may be wrong, but it does not seem to 
me that this is true of Wallace Thur- 
man. He seems to me himself to deride 
blackness; he speaks of Emma’s color 
as a “‘splotch” on the “pale purity” of 
her white fellow students and as mock- 
ing that purity ‘with her dark outland- 
ish difference”. He says, “It would be 
painted red—Negroes always bedeck 
themselves and their belongings in 
ridiculously unbecoming clothes and 
ornaments.” 

It seems to me that this inner self- 
despising of the very thing that he is 
defending, makes the author’s defense 
less complete and less sincere, and keeps 
the story from developing as it should. 
Indeed, there seems to be no real de- 
velopment in Emma’s character; her 
sex life never becomes nasty and com- 
mercial, and yet nothing in her seems 
to develop beyond sex. 

Despite all this, the ending is not 
bad, and there is a gleam of something 
finer and deeper than the main part of 
the novel has furnished. One judges 
such a book, as I have said, with diffi- 
culty and perhaps with some prejudice 
because of the unpleasant work in the 
past to which the author has set his 
hand. Yet this book may be promise 
and pledge of something better, for it 
certainly frankly faces a problem which 
most colored people especially have 
shrunk from, and almost hated to face.

Problem of Summer 
(Continued from page 235) 
tages, private and public, and a club 
house. Summer resorts are growing up 
nearby, as at Westwoodland Park, and 
there is a colored cottage colony at 
Benton Harbor. In Minnesota, Wis- 
consin and Michigan, there are in some 
cases private country cottages. In the 
far West, Denver and Colorado 
Springs have hotels, boarding houses 
and camps for colored folk, but nearly 

all white resorts are closed to them. 

In the Northwest, there are a few 
hotels at Portland, Tacoma and 
Seattle; and in California at Oakland 
and San Francisco, where Negroes may 
also often use the regular hotels; in 
Southern California, there are hotels 
at Los Angeles and San Diego. 

To this general survey may be added 
the large number of colored persons 
who visit the large cities like New 
York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Bos- 
ton in summer time. Here they find 
hotel and boarding house accommoda- 
tions and the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. 
C. A. Summer school students by the 
thousands find vacation and work at 
Hampton, Tuskegee, Nashville and At- 
lanta, and also Northern Colleges.
