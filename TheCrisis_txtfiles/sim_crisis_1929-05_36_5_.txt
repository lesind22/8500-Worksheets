HE Southern Aid Society of Virginia, Inc. developed a 

$200.00 Industrial Debit in the Newark, N. J. area during 
the winter months, also an agency staff of six representa- 
tives, without employing or in any way interfering with 
the representatives of other companies. 


These accomplishments demonstrate again the attractive 
and protective value of this company’s Superior Policy Con- 
tract, and the practice of clean methods and fair play in 
building agency stafts.

CAN $500.00 OR MORE Fit INTO YOUR PLANS 
FOR YOUR BOY OR GIRLTEN YEARS FROM NOW? 


That is what our Insured Savings Plan for children does: supplies in cash ten years from 
now $500.00 or more to get your boy or girl started off to college, to meet some of the ex- 
penses of a start in business or a profession, or for the marriage of your girl. 


Study the table carefully. If your boy or girl is five years old now, and you make monthly 
deposits with our Insured Savings Plan of $4.50 per month, the end of each year is as follows: 


End Balance Cash Value Total Payable 

of in in cash at

TWemtm 2.6 sek 373.00 192.00 565.00 


When one hundred and twenty monthly deposits of $4.50 each are completed, there is a balance in the account of 
$373.00; there is $192.00 cash value in the life insurance policy, making $565.00 available in cash, whereas your 
deposits in all amount to only $540.00. In addition, you have had the insurance benefits for each year indicated 
in the column headed “Payable at Death,” had your child not lived to complete the ten years. 


There are other equally valuable features, such as the maturity of the policy as an Endowment, the inclusion of a 
provision to make the Balance on Deposit immediately available and all future premiums waived in event of per- 
manent and total disability of the parent. The amount can be $1,000.00, if you make twice the deposit. 


Our Insured Savings Plan can be the basis for a practical education in thrift, if you assist your boy or girl to 
make the monthly deposits themselves as they grow older. 


We say our plan is unique because no other Company offers it so far as we know. It applies to children from birth 
to age fifteen. More details with particular reference to your own plans will be sent if you fill in the coupon below 
and mail it today. There is no obligation for you and an instructive booklet goes with our letter. Write TODAY.

The record for 1928, which the figures above summarize, fit- 
tingly capped thirty years of progress. The substantial worth of 
the group service rendered by the National Benefit during those 
three decades need not be emphasized by us. It is an integral part 
of the forward march of the Race. It is a tradition which con- 
tinues. It has, however, been given emphasis by the award, to 
the founder of the company, of the 1928 Gold Medal and 
Honorarium of the Harmon Foundation, for the most distin- 
guished contribution to Negro business on a national scale. 


This high honor is one of which no man, and no institution, 
could be other than deeply proud. Coming from a source so dis- 
interested, so lofty of purpose, it has all the distinction of an 
accolade. But its real significance goes deeper than this. It lies 
in the concrete, practical benefits to the Race, of which it is but 
the outward symbol. It will be found permanently in the degree 
of real freedom which these benefits are surely increasing for the 
children of the Race as year follows year.

POSTSCRIPT. By W. E. B. Du Bois 





HE Italian Fascist Party has put 

up one ticket of their own and 
elected it by an unbelievably large ma- 
jority, to their own enthusiastic satis- 
faction. — Chiang-Kai-Shek deserted 
industrial democracy in China and at- 
tempted to lead the Burgeoisie toward 
Nationalism. He is stumbling if not 
falling between two stools: Militar- 
ism, backed by Japan, and Commun- 
ism, backed by Canton.—South Africa 
is going to vote on the fear of black 
folk and no one is satisfied with the 
election manifesto: neither those who 
are afraid, nor those who profess not 
to be.—Oklahoma has kicked out a 
Governor and is about to clean up the 
Supreme Court; while Louisiana is 
starting after her official drunkard. 
Thus, white supremacy truimphs.— 
Charles Henry Brent, long Bishop in 
the Philippines and fighter of British 
opium, is dead.—England, with the 
help of the ghost of Cecil Rhodes, is 
trying to deprive West Indian Negroes 
of Rhode Scholarships at Oxford.— 
General Motors has bought the Ger- 
man Auto Industry and will here- 
after conduct that part of the govern- 
ment.—The General Electric Com- 
pany has bought a large part of the

British Electric Industry and now is 
disputing as to whether this domina- 
tion of England by America shall be 
open or concealed.—The world goes 
merrily on. We have a new two bil- 
lion dollar bank in New York, which 
owns Haiti and South America. We 
have a billion dollar bank in Chicago 
that owns the Middle West. We 
have fifty Americans who own the 
earth. Sometime the voters will shed 
enough of their stupidity to vest in 
real popular government the imperial 
power that now rests in these private 
hands.—Meantime, what on _ earth 
shall our millionaires do with their 
millions? They can buy fake Rom- 
neys, smuggle whiskey, and fight the 
labor unions. But even these things 
pall_—The time for the complete col- 
lapse of the Russian Soviet Govern- 
ment has again been indefinitely post- 
poned.—If a Judge is a thief in the 
United States, all he has to do to es- 
cape prosecution is to stand on his 
dignity and resign.—What the United 


Tue Crisis will publish during 
the next few months a new short 
story by Charles W. Chesnutt; the 
story of what Captain James W. 
Floyd did for the freedom of 
Cuba; a play by Marita O. Bon- 
ner; an essay by C. F. Andrews of 
India; and an informing article on 
Negro physicians. 


——— 


States Government and the various 
states ought to do is to give up all their 
activities except those having to do 
with prohibition. They could then 
kill bootleggers on sight, sink the Brit- 
ish, Navy, and allow all Congressman 
to bring in their liquor for grand- 
father personally without annoyance.— 
There are few Negro scientists. This 
may be due to our small brain capacity 
or possibly to the fact that when a 
University like Harvard gives $58,000 
to 41 professors for scientific research, 
none of the professors would dare to 
have had a black Great-Grandfather. 
And besides, who ever heard of a col- 
ored Harvard professor or a colored 
Princeton student?—In Europe, a 
small group of men representing the 
bankers of the world are determining 
how much several million workers in 
Germany, France, England, Africa, 
and parts North, East, West and 
South, shall eat next year; what they 
shall wear; and how they shall live? 
It is a big responsibility, this Ger- 
many Reparations business.—They 
have buried a man in France and laid 
him beside Napoleon. He helped the 
nations murder millions. We know 
how to appreciate greatness.

VERY summer we were shipped 

back to the farm, that is, what was 
left of our grandfather’s place after 
the Civil War. 

What fun it was on the farm, after 
the city winter! Especially with Bob. 
Bob was a husky colored lad, slightly 
older and taller than we. Every day 
he came to milk the cows and do odd 
jobs around the place. My brother and 
[ followed him around adoringly, 
while he did his chores, helping where 
he would let us. 

As the milk streamed into pails, Bob 
would joke and sing, and we three 
were happy. Chores done, we were off 
for some glorious hours of play. Bob 
could always think of such corking 
things to do. Dashing from haystack 
to haystack playing tag, or throwing 
corncobs at the cows, to taunt them 
into chasing us. The best game of all 
was “sliding”. There were clay banks 
near the barn. After a rain, they 
were slick and shiney. The game 
was first to climb on all fours, up; 
then you’d earned a slide down. How 
we worked on those banks, to keep 
them smooth and slippery. For hours 
we toted milkpails of water from the 
horse trough. 

I remember Aunt Margaret’s horror 
at the continued yellow on my 
brother’s trousers and my once-white 
bloomers. 

Then one summer, when I was ten 
years old, my aunt called my brother 
and me to her and said in a serious 
voice, 

“You and Buster are getting to be 
big children now. Too big to play 
with Bob any longer.” 

“But why, Aunt Margaret?” 

‘““Well—” she was a kindly soul, but 
not an eyelid quivered as she said this— 
“vou know white people do not mix 
socially with Negroes. It was all right 
while you were little, but not any 
longer. Bob is a servant, you know. 
Speak nicely to him when you see him. 
But you are not to play together again. 
1 have spoken to him about this. He 
understands that if any of you disobey, 
he will have to be dismissed”’. 

“But—Aunt Margaret our 
voices trailed off. Deep misery and 
confusion engulfed us. 

Bob and we never played together 
again. Once we asked him. 

“Oh, please Bob”. The look on his 
face awed me. His suffering had 
depths unknown to us. He turned his 
head. I wanted to wail, to throw my 
arms around him... or to go out and 
fight. Instead, my brother and I crept

Beyond the Color Line 


By DOROTHY P. GARY 


This is the story of the exper- 
iences of a Southern white girl ex- 


ploring for friends beyond the color 
line. It is a true narrative by a 


young college instructor. 





away. Hidden in the barnloft we 
wept with a great, unnamed misery. 

It was not only that we had lost our 
chum. Something big, something ugly 
had descended upon us. Something 
which awoke in me a vast incoherent 
questioning. And rebellion. 

This was my first lesson in “the race 
problem”. 





ELLE was the most beautiful crea- 

ture I had ever seen. I would go 

into the kitchen of our Southern home, 

where she was at work, climb into a 

chair, plump my elbows on her work 

table and fasten my child’s eyes on her 
warm brown face. 

Her soft voice rose and fell as she 
moved leisurely from stove to cabinet. 
Best of all, I liked to watch her smooth 
arms and hands kneading the dough. 
Belle was a mulatto, combining in her 
makeup the best elements of both races. 
A study in soft browns shading into 
rose at the cheeks and mouth, and into 
gleaming black at the hair and eyes. 
Nose and mouth were finely chiseled. 

One day I brought my books out 
into the kitchen for study. 

“What you got thar, honey chile?” 
Her voice sounded husky. 

Jes’ lessons, Belle”. A sixth grade 
geography it was, spread out before 
me. 

“Les hear you read some out loud 
to me”. Then, “I wisht I could read 
that thar book. Lemme try.” For an 
hour we spelled out the sentences to- 
gether. 

Suddenly Belle stopped. Her face 
hardened. “Oh, you’re lucky, little’un, 
to go to school”’. 

“But diden you go, Belle?” 

“Naw.” 

“But why diden you, Belle? Doan 
colored children have to go to school, 
too?” 

“Huh!” Bitterness seemed to choke 
the words back down her throat. 

Next day in school I asked the 
teacher, ‘““Why doan colored children 
have to go to school like white children 
do? And why diden someone learn 
folks, like Belle our cook, to read ’n 
write?” But the most I got was a 
correction for my poor grammar. 






Sometimes when I would go into 
the kitchen Belle would be sitting with: 
her face hidden in her arms, crying. 

“What’s the matter, Belle? Oh, 
what's the matter?” But she never 
would tell. 

Once she said, “Better thank de’ 
Lord, chile, you wasen born colored”. 

Belle had two small children to sup- 
port on her three dollars a week wage. 
Children whose white father they 
never knew. (This fact I overheard 
my elders discussing). Belle used to 
take our old clothes that were given 
her, and make them over for her little 
ones. But this was slow work since it 
had to be done after the twelve hours 
she worked in our kitchen. 

Then one day Belle left our kitchen, 
never to come back. No one would 
tell me why, but then in the backyard 
one day I overheard the cook next- 
door saying, 

“Yes’m, Belle’s done took up a life 
of shame. You know the white mens 
woulden leave her alone. Offered her 
lots of money. She sure was one pretty 
*oman”’. 

Very likely the three dollars was not 
enough. 





T was while a student at Columbia 
that I came to know Ethel, a gaunt 
dark girl who cleaned the rooms and 
dim hallways of the dormitory in which 
we lived. Three of us students were 
in the midst of a lively debate when 
unexpectedly the issue turned on Vic- 
tor Hugo’s “Les Miserables”. Janet 
admitted that she had never read any 
of Hugo’s works. Ethel straightening 
up from her work, said quietly,

To our amazement we found Ethel 
had graduated from George Washing- 
ton University with honors. Highly 
trained at her chosen work as secre- 
tary, she was unable to get a job, be- 
cause of her color; doomed to clean 
floors because she was black. 

Ethel brought Hugo to Janet. To 
me, she brought a closer grip on this 
monster race prejudice. 

She was the first colored person 
whom I had known who was willing 
to explain to one ofthe wronging race, 
the Black Man’s Burden. This gentle 
girl would fire with a wrath that 
seared and rent us both. Fact followed 
ugly fact until I fairly ached with the 
shame of being white. 

But Ethel had no solution, and 
neither had I. Just two individuals

the National Inter-racial Con- 
ference at Washington, D. C., 
December 19, 1928. It is pub- 
lished here entire, with only 
verbal changes. 


HAT we know about the civil 

and political rights of Negroes 
in the United States; what significance 
this knowledge has for social organi- 
zations whose purpose it is to improve 
conditions; and what further study by 
universities and research organizations 
is called for, is the subject of this 
paper. 

Our general knowledge may thus be 
summarized: There is a system of 
color caste in the United States based 
on legal and customary race distinc- 
tions and discriminations, having to do 
with separation in travel, in schools, 
in public accommodations, in residence 
and in family relations. There is dis- 
crimination in the kind and amount of 
public school education and in civil 
rights of various sorts and in courts, 
jails and fines. There is disfranchise- 
ment of voters by means of various 
tests, including restrictions as to regis- 
tration, and as to voting in primaries; 
and including the right of summary ad- 
ministrative decisions; and finally there 
is lynching and mob violence. 

Over against this there are the war 
amendments of the Constitution and 
various civil right laws of the states 
and the decisions of the courts in these 
matters. 

The results of these discriminations 
have been pretty carefully studied in 
the case of education and lynching, 
but have received little systematic 
study in the matter of voting and civil 
rights. 

[ doubt if it would be worth while 
to examine and expatiate on the gen- 
eral and pretty well-known facts of 
Negro citizenship and caste. I, there- 
fore, pass to the matter of the signifi- 
cance of this general knowledge for 
social organizations whose purpose is 
to improve conditions. 


AFRAID OF FACTS 


ERE we are confronted not simply 

by lack of exact data but by a clear 
disposition not to investigate or even 
to discuss. I know of no organization 
that has ever proposed to study Negro 
suffrage.

The Honorable Oscar De Priest, 





wenty-Second Negro Congressman. 


THE 









Crisis 





ISIS 


I distinctly remember when this re- 
coiling from the facts covered other 
fields. ‘There was a time when social 
studies, having to do primarily with the 
health, physique and growth of the 
Negro population, were of pressing im- 
portance because of the widespread as- 
sumption that the Negro was not 
adapted to the American climate or to 
conditions of life under freedom and 
that he was bound sooner or later to 
die out. 

It was necessary, therefore, to test 
by such scientific measurements as were 
available these assumptions. Yet for 
a long time universities and social or- 
ganizations refused to touch the matter 
and philanthropists refused funds and 
encouragement when Atlanta Uni- 
versity attempted its wretchedly re- 
stricted pioneer work. ‘Times changed. 
Today, tests and measurements have 
gone so far that there is no further 
question of the survival of the Negro 
race in America and the physical studies 
connected with him are no different 
and demand no different technique or 
organization from the general physical 
studies carried on in the nation. The 
real question narrows down to matters 
of sanitation, hospitals and income. 
What has Negro suffrage to do with 
these ? 


GAIN, between the years 1890 
and 1910, the right of the Ameri- 
can Negro to modern education had to 
be established and proven. It was as- 
sumed that the ability of the Negro to 
assimilate a college education was at 
least questionable; and it was dogmati- 
cally stated ‘that the economic future of 
the Negro in America was such that all 
that he needed was industrial training 
to make him a contented laborer and 
servant; that this class of people did 
not need political power and could not 
use it; but that on the contrary their 
disfranchisement would free the South 
so that it could divide its vote on 
pressing political matters; and that the 
South could be depended upon to guard 
the rights of this working caste. 

The fight was bitter.and long drawn 
out. Those of us who insisted that in 
modern industrial life no laboring class 
could maintain itself without educa- 
tional leadership and political power 
were assailed, put out of court, accused 
of jealousy, and of an overwhelming 
desire to promote miscegenation. 

Today finds the educational part 
of our contention answered by facts. 
We have twelve thousand college stu- 
dents, where we had less than one thou- 
sand in 1900, and we are graduating 
today annually 1500 Bachelors of Art, 
when in 1900 we sent out less than 
150. It is admitted now without seri- 
ous question that the American Negro 
can use modern education for his group

development, in economic and spiritual 
life. 

There is, however, still the feeling 
that the present problems of Negro 
education are problems of charity, good 
will, self-sacrifice and double taxation 
and not problems which depend pri- 
marily for their final solution upon 
political power. 

So, too, in the matter of housing, 
recreation and crime, we seem to 
assume that a knowledge of the facts 
of discrimination and of the needs of 
the colored public are sufficient, with 
faith, hope and charity, to bring ulti- 
mate betterment; and that in present- 
ing demands to the government of city, 
state and nation, we have only to prove 
that Negro poverty, disease and crime 
hurt white citizens in order to induce 
the lawmakers elected by white citi- 
zens to do justice to black citizens. 


POLITICAL POWER 


N the matter of occupation and in- 

come the need of political power in 
any laboring class is conceded by every 
social student ; for the American Negro 
or his friends to dream that he can 
sustain himself as a peasant proprietor, 
an artisan or day laborer, and secure 
recognition from his organized voting 
white fellow worker and a decent wage 
from his employer, without a vote, 
is extraordinary. It is a conceded im- 
possibility in every modern land. 

We can point with. some pride to 
what has been accomplished in the 
courts in breaking down caste and es- 
tablishing Negro citizenship, and in the 
abolition of mob law and _ lynching. 
But we are still uncertain in estimating 
the cause and effects of such actions. 

I have heard a number of plausible 
and attractive explanations of the de- 
cline of lynching from 226 in 1896 to 
11 in 1928. Some attribute it to 
prayer, and others to inter-racial reso- 
lutions; but I see it differently. I see 
lynching increase and decrease indiffer- 
ently, until in 1919 a nationwide agi- 
tation was begun by the N. A. A. C. 
P., backed by statistics, advertisements 
and meetings. The curve of mob mur- 
der fell lazily. Then suddenly in a sin- 
gle year it dropped 75%. I study the 
occurrences of that year, 1922. And 
that study leads me to believe that the 
effective check to lynching was the 
organized political power of Northern 
Negroes that put the Dyer Anti- 
Lynching Bill through the House of 
Representatives January 26, 1922, by 
a vote of 230 to 119. 


THE FILIBUSTER 


HE bill was forced through a sen- 
ate committee and reported to the 
Senate with a majority pledged to its 
passage. The only way that the South 


accomplished its defeat was by refusing 
to allow the government of the United 
States to function. Knowing that such 
high-handed measures were going a bit 
too far, the South promised to stop 
lynching and it has pretty nearly kept 
its word. And yet consider the cost: 
there has not been in Poland or in 
Haiti, in Russia or in the Balkans, a 
more open, impudent, and shameless 
holding up of Democracy than the 
senators of the Bourbon South, holding 
office on the disfranchised Negro vote, 
accomplished in November, 1922. 

The success which we have had be- 
fore the courts in abolishing the heredi- 
tary right to vote which the “Grand- 
father” clauses bestowed on white 
Southerners; the fight against segrega- 
tion in residence and its spread in 
schools ; the fight against the white pri- 
mary and numerous Civil Rights cases 
have not simply been brought to suc- 
cessful issue because of our present 
small but increasing political power, 
but are without significance unless they 
point to fuller political power. 

I do not for a moment argue that 
political power will immediately abol- 
ish color caste, make ignorant men in- 
telligent or bad men good. We have 
caste and discrimination in the North 
with the vote and social progress in 
some parts of the South without it. 
But there is this vast difference: in 
states like New York where we are 
beginning to learn the meaning and 
use of the ballot we are building a firm 
and unshakable basis of permanent 
freedom. While every advance in the 
South unprotected by political power is 
based on chance and changing person- 
alities and may at any time be vetoed 
by a hostile voting group. I maintain 
that political power is the beginning of 
all permanent reform and the only 
hope for maintaining gains. 


THE NEGRO VOTE 
HERE is today a surprisingly 
large number of intelligent and 

sincere people, both white and black, 
who really believe that the Negro 
problem in the United States can ulti- 
mately be solved without our being 
compelled. to face and settle the ques- 
tion of the Negro vote. 

Nearly all of our social studies ap- 
parently come to this conclusion, cither 
openly or by assumption, and do not 
say, as they ought to say, and as every- 
one knows in the long run they must 
say, that granted impulse by philan- 
thropy, help by enlightened public 
opinion, and the aid of time, no per- 
manent improvement in the economic 
and social condition of Negroes is go- 
ing to be made so long as they are de- 
prived of political power to support 
and defend it. 


Nowhere else in the world is there 


155 












































any suggestion that a modern laboring 
class can permanently better _ itself 
without political power. It may be a 
question, it certainly is a question, as 
to just how labor is going to use this 
power ultimately so as to raise its eco- 
nomic and social status. But there is 
no question, but that such power must 
be had and today the world over it is 
being used. 

With all the research that has gone 
on formerly, and especially in the last 
few years with regard to the American 
Negro, with singular equanimity, noth- 
ing has been said or done with regard 
to the Negro vote. I am, therefore, 
stressing in this paper the significance 
and the danger of this omission and 
I am seeking to say that of all the 
questions that are before us today that 
of political power on the part of the 
American Negro occupies, to my mind, 
the key position, and is the question 
which peculiarly tests the good faith 
of the American people, the honesty 
of philanthropy in America toward 
the Negro, and the sincerity of the 
National Inter-racial Conference. 


4 DEBATE 


LISTENED yesterday with mount- 

ing astonishment to a discussion of 
school betterment in the South. I am 
convinced that in no other civilized 
country in the world could such a dis- 
cussion have taken place. The crucial 
problem was that of raising local funds 
for schools and of having the National 
Government supplement those funds in 
the poorer states: and the essential 
point in the whole matter was surely 
the selection of local officials who 
would spend the money as the local 
voting population wished; would raise 
funds by local taxation fairly placed 
on local wealth and would expend Na- 
tional monies equitably. In any other 
land the first point of the debate would 
have been the question of the selection 
of such proper officials and of the 
democratic control of their actions. 


That question in the debate to which 
I listened was never raised. It was 
assumed that, although there were to 
be separate schools for Negroes, Ne- 
groes were to have no voice.in the se- 
lection of local officials, no control of 
their own taxation, no vote on expendi- 
ture; and that despite this through 
philanthropy and good will you were 
going to get and maintain a decent and 
adequate school system for them. 


If the present rulers of Russia had 
heard this debate they would have gone 
into gales of laughter; and if any gov- 
ernment had attempted to carry on a 
debate on these lines in the English 
Parliament, the German Reichstag or 
the French Chamber of Deputies, the 


government would have been thrown 


156 


out forthwith. Every Englishman, 
Frenchman and German would have 
said, without qualification, that educa- 
tion today can not be carried on as a 
matter of philanthropy and good will: 
that it is the duty of the State and 
that back of the State must stand 
some effective democratic control. 


DEMOCRACY 


OST nations would have made 

this control the ballot in the hands 
of all adult citizens and even Italy and 
Russia and Turkey would affirm that 
this is the ideal toward which they 
consistently and steadily march. 

It is of extraordinary significance 
that in an intelligent and open-hearted 
assembly, such a clear and obvious 
point was either not thought of or 
worse yet, the members did not have 
the courage to make it. 


In the question of the lack of pub- 
lic funds for growing expense in educa- 
tion one cannot assume that Americans 
do not know what the public thought 
of the world in the most progressive 
countries is doing, in insisting that 
wealth bear a greater burden of taxa- 
tion and that poverty be exempt. The 
United States is the one great country 
of the world where wealth is escaping 
taxation and where the burden of pub- 
lic contributions that falls upon the 
farmer, the small householder, the la- 
borer and particularly the black laborer 
is crushing in its incidence; and yet 
how little is said of drafting by uni- 
versal suffrage sufficient wealth for the 
public good to pay every reasonable ex- 
pense and of putting the people, black 
and white, back of such draft. 

I hold this truth to be self evident, 
that a disfranchised working-class in 
modern industrial civilization is worse 
than helpless. It is a menace, not 
simply to itself, but to every other 
group in the community. It will be 
diseased; it will be criminal; it will 
be ignorant; it will be the plaything of 
mobs, and it will be insulted by caste 
restrictions. 


So far we are upon old ground. This 
argument has been urged many times 
in the past. It has failed to impress 
the people of the United States simply 
because so many folk do not care about 
the future of American Negroes. They 
once almost hoped that the problem 
would be settled by the Negroes dying 
out or migrating, or bowing in dumb 
submission to any kind of treatment 
that the people of the United States de- 
cided to give them. 

But, today, the matter is changed, 
and it is changed because those Ameri- 
cans who have any ability to see and 
think are beginning slowly to realize 
that when Democracy fails for one 





group in the United States, it tails for 
the nation; and when it fails for the 
United States it fails for the world. A 
disfranchised group compels the dis- 
franchisement of other groups. ‘The 
white primary system in the South is 
simply a system which compels the 
white man to disfranchise himself in 
order to take the vote away from the 
Negro. 


The present extraordinary political 
psychology of the Negro in the South; 
namely that the voluntary disfranchise- 
ment of intelligent and thrifty black 
men is helping to solve the Negro prob- 
lem, is simply putting into the hands of 
scoundrels and grafters white and 
black the meagre remains of those po- 
litical rights which 200,000 black civil 


war soldiers fought to gain. 


THE BOURBON SOUTH 


LL this has led to extraordinary 

results. In the past we have de- 
plored disfranchisement in the South 
because of its effect on the Negro. But 
it is not simply that the Negro remains 
a slave as long as he is disfranchised, but 
that Southern white laborers are drag- 
ged inevitably down to the Negro’s 
position, and that the decent white 
South is not only deprived of decent 
government, but of all real voice in 
both local and national government. It 
is as true today as it ever was that the 
nation cannot exist half slave and half 
free. 

Today, in the South, politicians have 
every incentive to cut down the num- 
ber of voters, black and white. The 
Republican organization, in nine cases 
out of ten, becomes simply the tail to 
the Democratic kite. Party govern- 
ment disappears. Political power is 
vested in the hands of a clique of pro- 
fessional politicians, white and black, 
and there is nothing that has been done 
in dirty politics by Tammany in New 
York, by Thompson in Chicago, or 
Vare in Philadelphia, that you cannot 
find duplicated by the _ political 
oligarchies which rule the Southern 
South. 


Political ignorance in the South has 
grown by leaps and bounds. The mass 
of people in the South today have no 
knowledge as to how they are governed 
‘or by whom. Elections have nothing 
to do with broad policies and sogial de- 
velopment but are matters of the selec- 
tion of friends to lucrative offices and 
punishment of personal enemies. Local 
administration is a purposely disguised 
system of intrigue which not even an 
expert could unravel. 


Today, a small group of Western 
Congressmen, to the dismay of East 
and South, are ‘investigating the sale of

RISIS 


HE calm gods must often pity 

the dark beauty and passion of 
human life. They see evil, of no ac- 
count to them, a constant though hid- 
den presence to man. Our morning 
wishes are frustrate before dusk; as- 
piration, courage, love, sacrifice, all 
appear at last as broken melody. 

The antique sculpture of Laoko6én 
suggests the universal tragedy of man, 
tortured by serpentine desires and ener- 
gies, with his nemesis folded in his 
very soul. Continually snatched away 
by some desire for happiness, we only 
lay ourselves open to the pain of in- 
toxication and passion. “Our life is 
not so much threatened as our percep- 
tion,” writes Emerson. We are chil- 
dren of the fire, fascinated by every 
spark. What calm temper is not 
tossed aside “for a fantasy and trick 
of fame”, what high purpose does not 
prove ironically obtuse and abrupt, 
what vision do we at last prefer to our 
dream of passion and_ inconstant 
beauty ? 

Yet there is one purpose sufficiently 
constant. An inextricable mingling of 
false and true in the whole of our 
lives is surely the very essence of our 
being. The most honest of us is a 
walking figment, an elaborate gesture. 
Life will not accept us otherwise. Hop- 
ing to attain the true, we inadvertently 
sacrifice truth; we can find no way to 
fashion a nobler reality without em- 
ploying countless shams and attitudes. 
The love of truth, like a clarion, may 
stir even your sheerest demagogue, 
your emptiest crier of “service”. For 
the moment, caught by the recital of 
some noble action, his imagination 
sways him, and he dares at least to 
speak for truth. To-morrow, we 
know, he will betray us. Nor is such 
meanness unfamiliar to our own na- 
tures. We have a blood kinship to 
honest Iago, “more fell than anguish, 
hunger, or the sea!” We have be- 
trayed our friends, clothed advantage 
with loving gestures. We who have 
deserted our friends in their need 
know the constancy of that pity and 
sympathy the humanitarians invent. 

Thus consciousness loses its reality ; 
our two worlds of counterfeit and 
truth are hopelessly grown into every 
relationship. No man knows us. We 
do not know ourselves, nor do we care 
to look too closely. Perhaps all life’s 
beauties would fade upon examination. 
Here are the despicable and the noble, 
the foul and the fair, and the rela- 


May, 1929 


Savage or Serene 


By ALLISON DAVIS 


Here is a beautiful philosophy 
daringly clear, calmly cynical 
and yet with a final clinging to 


hope and high ideals. It is an 
essay worth study and deep 
thought. 





tionship is not to be traced. Which 
of us, father and daughter, high- 
souled friends, poet-lover and deep- 
eyed girl, which purest of us can af- 
ford not to hide the greater part of our 
life from our beloved? 


EAR and fragile. “like sweet 

thoughts in a dream’, is the illu- 
sion of love. The mystery and adven- 
ture of life open in infinite vista 
through the strangeness of this one 
woman’s being, through fate and time, 
for thee! And our faith, beautiful in 
this moment, this year, is a poignant 
memory thereafter. 

For, love, to be free of passion’s 
nemesis, must be bound, and in that 
binding find its freedom. There is 
love for the beauty of high action, 
which is indeed “pure and clear and not 
clogged with the pollutions of mortal- 
ity and all the colors of human life.” 
Yet passion is a craving not to be 
quieted by reason nor human will. 
There are those in search of peace, 
who think only to glimpse beauty; 
straightway they are insnared by the 
golden net of passion. ‘There are poets 
who, instead of a high imagination imi- 
tating the calm temper of the soul, re- 
veal only their taints of blood. Ah, 
poets and lovers, hoping to win vision 
from sham and grossness! 

Love is a brief, falling melody. The 
bitter chords of courage must be 
played to the very end. We are most 
convinced when men have shed their 
blood. With what shining courage, 
yea, challenges to the gods, have men 
died, even in our day, for loyalties 
built on prejudice and tangled hatreds! 
Perhaps courage for them was desper- 
ation, the will to try the last when the 
dark tower reared before them, un- 
aware. We love Don Quixote, but we 
know that his obstinate insistence upon 
valor, in a world of knaves and inn- 
keepers, is ridiculous. 


IFE is savage only for those who 
are unable to sense the end and 
destiny of its crude power. We may 
glimpse the inmost fates in the pattern 
of men’s actions, although they remain 


inscrutable to passion or reason. The 
gods offer us a high mystery, in which 
patience, compass, endurance, are as 
mysterious as our petulancy and wan- 
tonness. Guided by a finer image of 
our fate, incited by a nobler illusion, 
we come at length upon the highway. 
There is humility, the chastening con- 
sciousness of universal tragedy. And 
there, at last, is a high imagination re- 
conciling us to the calm gods. 

There is courage and beauty which 
is self-denial. Son and daughter find 
such courage in their parents. Here 
it anywhere, they conceive, are spirits 
who have sacrificed to a purer beauty 
their dearest passions. Yet there will 
appear, alongside, envy and jealousy,— 
for sacrifice is more often lauded than 
achieved. For mother and father, be- 
sides the mystery of these new souls 
moving within and beyond their con- 
trol, doubtless there is regret for aspira- 
tion and passion, sacrificed unwittingly. 
And, well hidden, there is remorse for 
the nemesis of their own lives renewing 
itself inevitably. Youth, too, is care- 
less of renunciation and trust, and im- 
patient of any love which demands 
sacrifice. In a moment, your son will 
give over the adventure of your life to 
chance and passion. 


T last death rounds out the im- 

moral appearance of life. Here 
is evil which the valiancy of our spirit 
cannot o’ercrow. ‘We shall be fables 
presently.” What matter if from the 
chaos there emerge the fitful strivings 
of mothers, friends, heroes? Hailed 
away from even a noble battle, they 
leave us only silence, “labial gossip of 
night”. 

Under the chastening view of death, 
the struggles and aims and fruits of 
our lives must appear fatally perverse. 
But we are no more mindful of her 
ceaseless whispering than is the figure 
in the old morality. Life is not to be 
reconciled with death; we are men, not 
shades. Yet in a moment, the change, 
—good and evil are one,—‘‘the rest is 
silence”. Our individuality, our con- 
sciousness of volition revolt against 
this pagan fact, irrational and unmoral, 
convincing us that the quality of life 
is as savage as its doom: 


“Time, a maniac scattering dust, 
And Life, a Fury flinging flame, 


And men the flies of latter spring,

THE N.A.A.C-P. BATTLE FRONT 











THE N. A. 4. C. P. IN THE 
SOUTH 

HE land of cotton and the Na- 

tional Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People are some- 
times thought of as separated by a wide 
gulf. Thoughtless people suppose and 
speak of the N. A. A. C. P. as a 
Northern institution. Its National 
Office is “safely” located in New York 
City, at 69 Fifth Avenue. Its main 
financial strength is derived from 
northern and western states. And so 
the careless story gains currency that 
the N. A. A. C. P. is northern, of the 
North, and that it is not to be expected 
to penetrate the South spiritually or 
physically. 

But is this the fact? I have just been 
looking over the proofs of the Asso- 
ciation’s Annual Report for the year 
1928, which will go to press shortly 
and which ought to be printed by the 
time this is published. That report 
casts an interesting light on the as- 
sumption that the N. A. A. C. P. is 
a northern institution. 

Particularly interesting and _signifi- 
cant is the report of Robert W. Bag- 
nall’s Department of Branches. That 
report shows, among other things that 
meetings of the N. A. A. C. P. were 
held during the year in 33 states and 
the District of Columbia, this list of 
states including many of the far South. 
For example, meetings were held in 
Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, 
Mississippi, Missouri, Maryland, Ar- 
kansas, not to speak of North Carolina 
and West Virginia. In addition, says 
Mr. Bagnall’s report, “Messrs. Bag- 
nall, Du Bois, Johnson and Miss Ov- 
ington made extensive tours in the 
South during the year.’’ Addresses 
were delivered at Tuskegee and ‘Talla- 
dega, in Atlanta University, New Or- 
leans University, Xavier College, New 
Orleans, and other southern institutions 
of learning. 

So that through its travelling emis- 
saries, the Secretary, the Field Secre- 
tary, the Director of Branches, the Edi- 
tor of the Crisis and the Chairman of 
the Board, the N. A. A. C. P. main- 
tained close touch with the part of the 
South which will most affect the fu- 
ture of race relations, the youth. 

But the visits of its national officers, 
to hold meetings in Southern cities of 
the far South, to address schools and 
colleges there, are not the only contact 
the N. A. A. C. P. has maintained. 
Examine the roster of its court vic- 
tories which have made history for the 


158 


Negro in America, which have estab- 
lished fundamental rights for all 
classes of citizens, and it appears plainly 
that the N. A. A. C. P. has reached 
directly into the heart of the South. 


Take the most effective attack which 
has yet been delivered on the white pri- 
mary system in Southern states, by 
which the disfranchisement of colored 
people is bolstered. That system was 
given a deadly blow through the Texas 
white primary case carried before the 
United States Supreme Court and won 
there. How did it originate? Through 
a colored man, of El] Paso, Texas, 
backed up by the local N. A. A. C. P. 
and later by the weight of the National 
body and its eminent legal committee. 

Another case: Arkansas peonage. 
When the news went out to the nation 
in 1919, that Negro tenant farmers had 
organized to “massacre” the whites in 
Phillips County, Arkansas, and this was 
made the excuse for shooting down doz- 
ens of Negroes in cold blood, who went 
into that territory and got the facts? 
Walter White, Assistant Secretary of 
the Association. Who carried the cases 
of these Arkansas colored tenant farm- 
ers before the Supreme Courts of the 
State of Arkansas and of the United 
States ? 

I suppose Kentucky will be conceded 
to be a Southern state. It was there 
the famous Louisville Segregation case 
originated, which has forever made un- 
constitutional the passing of ordinances 
by state or city in this country, setting 
aside residential districts on the basis 
of race and color—a decision by the 
way which does not protect the Negro 
alone but other minority groups as well. 
At this very moment, in another south- 
ern city, Richmond, Virginia, a case is 
being fought, with the advice and help 
of the Association, seeking to reafirm 
this very principle. 

As for lynching, before the N. A. A. 
C. P. stepped into the front line some 
twenty years ago, it was an almost un- 
contradicted slander that the Negro 
was a rapist and that lynchings oc- 
curred chiefly to avenge “the usual 
crime”. There was but one way to 
meet this slander. With facts. Those 
facts had to be obtained in the heart of 
the South. They were obtained there, 
often at risk of the lives of the investi- 
gators who volunteered to go in fur- 
therance of the work which the N. A. 
A. C. P. was doing. That slander is 
as nearly dead as any widespread and 
insistently reiterated slander can be. 
The work of the Association killed it. 


Of the five important victories be- 
fore the United States Supreme Court, 
establishing fundamental principles of 
the Negro’s civil rights in the United 
States, exactly five, or 100 per cent, 
originated south of Mason and Dixon. 

Now it would be possible to go on 
indefinitely with individual instances of 
what the N. A. A. C. P. has done in 
the South. But that is not altogether 
the point. It is not alone what the 
N. A. A. C. P. has done but what it 
has stimulated others to do that be- 
comes important. 

It did dramatize the question of the 
Negro and his relationship to the coun- 
try and particularly the white South, in 
a way that was new. It did provide a 
pressure of public sentiment, which 
caused the passage by the House of 
Representatives of the Dyer Anti- 
Lynching Bill. And that measure has 
remained an ever-present threat, one 
which was given a prominent place in 
all political discussions during the last 
campaign in the South; and which had 
to do with the sudden drop in lynching 
figures to eleven in 1928, the lowest 
figure reached in the forty years that 
statistics have been kept. 

Moreover, the N. A. A. C. P. has 
furnished example and leadership to 
other forces operating in the South: the 
Federal Council of Churches of Christ ; 
the Commission on Interracial Co- 
operation. And with innumerable in- 
dividuals, writers, editors and others, 
the Association has maintained a steady 
stream of correspondence. Colored 
members of its staff have lectured be- 
fore classes of white students in white 
Southern universities; books, radio ad- 
dresses, magazine and newspaper ar- 
ticles have reached audiences of mil- 
lions, in the South as well as in other 
sections. 

It seems only fair to say then, that 
if conditions are rapidly changing in 
the South; if there is beginning to be 
hope of new and better and more en- 
lightened relations petween Negro and 
white in the southern states, that de- 
velopment will owe something, will owe 
indeed much, to the steady, twenty- 
year long, unremitting work of the 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People. 

So when anyone tells you it is a 
northern body ; that its office is on Fifth 
Avenue; that it represents the north- 
ern Negroes chiefly, there are a few 
facts to be considered as a refutation 
of such a statement.

“For he. knows, though the great black 
frost may blight 

The hope of May in a single night, 

That the spring, though it shrinks back 
under the bark, 

But bides its time, somewhere in the 
dark.” 

—Richard Hovey 


AY on the way, that was what I 
found on a late February visit 
to the woods. This little world. of 
trees was divided by a run that had 
just been set to stirring by a warmer 
day. Indeed the fields leading to the 
woods were almost freed from snow. 
But the floor of the woods was white 
in most places. 

A south facing slope to the run was 
saddle brown with fallen oak and elm 
leaves. The opposite hill held its 
wrapping of white. On the way down 
this hillside I found a thick packing of 
brown leaves peeping from snow at the 
roots of a tree. A strip of green 
showed just under the withered leaves. 
What was there? Hepaticas, looking 
wonderfully contented under a_ roof 
of the elm tree root and the leaf 
thatching. A perfect nest of hepatica 
or blootroot leaves was hiding there. 
Lively and young and green the leaves 
were waiting for their white and laven- 
der tinted blossoms.

Te candle in the soft night air 


Tosses its blue and golden hair. 
The candle when the night is through 
Wears just a crooked long black queue.

And then a little pennyroyal 
That must have fallen from the purse 
And taken root there in the soil. 


The Spider and the Fairy 


This African folk tale was written 
by Pauline E. Dinkins just as it was 
told to her by a native in West Africa. 

NCE upon a time it was “hungry 


time”. Everybody was looking 
for food. Rabbit went into the woods 


one day and saw a palm tree by the 
river. He ran up the tree and while 
he was cutting nuts one fell into the 
water. He went into the water to find 
it and there he saw a beautiful town 
governed by a beautiful fairy. 


The fairy asked Rabbit why he came

into the town.. He answered: 

“My palm nut fell into the water 
and I came to look for it.” 

The fairy said, “Your palm nut 
spoiled part of my house and I want 
you to fix it.” 

Immediately Rabbit went for sticks 
and thatch and made the fairy’s house 
just as beautiful as it had been. The 
fairy told Rabbit to go into her pantry 
and get one grain of rice and cook it, 
so he might have a bit of food. When 
it was cooked the grain of rice filled a 
big pot. The fairy gave him meat and 
oil. He ate until he was full and 
threw some of the rice away. 





The fairy gave Rabbit much rice 
and other things to take home with 
him. When Rabbit reached home late 
at night he found his children very 
hungry. So he cooked food for them 
at once. é 

Now Spider lived near Rabbit and 
Spider’s dog wanted to visit at Rabbit’s 
house. Spider did not want him to 
go. But the dog had smelled the. food 
at Rabbit’s house and he went anyway. 

Rabbit gave the dog all that he 
wanted to eat and put some of the 
food into pans and hung them on the 
dog’s neck. When the dog reached

The Gray Man Speaks 
By WALTER EVERETT WARING 
INCE I know 
The good and bad 
Of the White Man, 
And the good and bad 
Of the Black Man, 
And in my blood 
Bear the virtues, 
And hopes, 
And vices 
Of each, 
Can you wonder 
That I must pause, 
Uncertain and puzzled, 
Before I speak, 
Before I act? 


Late Afternoon 
By FRANCES M. FROST 


HE snow was falling softly when she 
came 
To the edge of the slope and saw the 
blurred grey sky 
Reach down to sombre pines. No sumac- 


flame 

Beside the path this time: she snowshoed 
by 

Dark leafless clumps and ghosts of 
goldenrod, 


Following the hush that called her from 
the wood, 

Finding in whiteness deep on leaves and 
sod 

A soundlessness she somehow  under- 
stood. 


The wood seemed waiting for the fall- 
ing snow, 

Breathless and still and lovely in its sure 

Welcoming of further white, and so 

She found a beauty she could not endure. 

Her quick hand shut her eyes out from 
the sight: 

The woods would take the kiss of snow 
all night. 


The Negro Sings of Winds 
By GEORGE LEONARD ALLEN 


HEY call me! Ah, those never- 
ceasing winds! 


And they have called me through the 


centuries 

From those dim forests where the world 
begins, 

From golden, sun-kissed lands beyond 
the seas! 

Not bitter-breathing winds of ice and 
sleet, 

Not tranquil zephyrs, murmuring soft 
and low, 

But winds whose fierce caress is hot and 
sweet 

With passion pale men’s hearts can never 
know! 


160 


Wild winds which whirled and danced 
across the plains, 

Which whistled through the lurid jungle 
morn, 

Which moaned among the hills their 
eerie strains 

Ten thousand years before the Sphinx 
was born! 

Strong winds which bore my fathers’ 
battle-cries, 

Which roused their hearts to love, or 
calmed to peace,— 

They call me! and within my spirit rise 

Fierce yearnings aye, that cannot, will 
not cease! 


And over countless leagues of swirling 
sea, 

Through all the years, I’ve heard their 
wild refrain, 

I’ve known the joy of their weird mel- 
ody, 

The fierce, ecstatic tumult of their pain! 

And long as those impetuous winds shall 
blow, 

Though paler men may never feel their 
surge, 

My songs will bear their burden! I 
shall know 


Their fervent, fiery passion and their 


urge! 

And though my spirit from that distant 
land 

A thousand miles, a thousand years may 
sever, 


I know those winds on that far, sun- 
warmed strand 
Will call me back forever and forever! 


Democracy 
By A. ALOYSIUS GREENE 
"RE scene: a crowded subway train 
At the close of a busy day. 
Blue-blood hob-nobs with plebeian, 
Wending their homeward way. 


The milling, pawing crowds push in, 
Some treading on my feet; 

While on either side of small brown me, 
Remains an empty seat. 


Nordic 
By LILLIAN BYRNES 


E takes his love much as he takes 
his wine; 

He does not sip or taste, 

Or gaze upon its long imprisoned sun- 

shine— 

He gulps. . 

Men must perforce get drunk; 

It is written somewhere. 


And having been drunk, 

He curses the wine for being red, 
The love for being passion, 
Ensnaring him. 


Sober and repentant and miserable, 

He makes resolutions against wine and 
love; 

So that when he indulges in either, 

He can fall— 

As people ought who so indulge; 

And feel as people ought 

About it afterward. 


Then he is Puritan. 


Or he is lusty, male, resplendent, 
Knowing that he should sin 

On general principles. 

He tosses away the empty glass 
Insolently ; 

Satiate and comfortable, 

He consigns the harlot, love, 

To her fixed domain of the senses— 
Then he is the “Great Blond Beast”. 


To Dr. W. E. B. D. 
By ELEANOR HOYSRADT 


7 Aas glittering eyes, Syrian nose, 
suave, pointed beard— 

You resemble a sunburnt Jew, 

A Turkish merchant from Constanti- 
nople, 

An Italian count, a Cuban, or a German 
diplomat, 

Anything but what you are: 

A Negro, born in the Berkshire foot- 


hills. 

You talk most intelligently of Negro 
pride, 

Negro pioneers, Negro poets, Negro 
problems. 


Your two-edged bitterness is enclosed 

In a subtle sheath of politeness. 

But somewhere in the secret depths of 
your mind 

A voice cries— 

For Yolande, the dark princess, your 
daughter, 

Homesick in Paris, 

And for the young son, who lies 

Beneath the snow, holding communion 

With the approaching spring. 

“Know your feelings, use your wants.” 

(Ah, do not weep for them! 

The dark princess will be happy with 
her lover 

And he who lies under the snow, has 
heard 

The first groping whispers of the hya- 
cinth roots = 


And is glad.) 


Disillusioned 
By ANTONIO JARVIS 


ITH stealthy tread the years have 
crept 
Upon my brief impassioned youth; 
I live no dreams, but bitter truth; 
Who has not found it so—and wept?

OUR MONTHLY SERMON 


HO determines what Negro 
artists shall write about? And 
what white authors shall say about 
Negroes? The publishers, of course. 
But who guides the publishers? 
Doubtless, publishers know some- 
thing of the spiritual trends of the 
times. Doubtless, they assume a cer- 
tain kind of leadership, but after all, 
the person who in the long run deter- 
mines what the publisher shall issue 
in book form, is the buyer. No, it is 
not the reader of books. The reader 
of books in the long run -indirectly in- 
fluences the buying. He guides the 
buyers, sometimes and somewhat. He 
talks to his friends and in this way 
helps the buyer to come to his decision. 
But the person who buys books is the 
one who is the real ruler in the situa- 
tion. It is book buyers that make 
Octavius Roy Cohen and Carl Van 
Vechten, just as the book buyers make 
DuBose Heyward and Claude Mc- 
Kay. They can make others. They 
can, if they will, bring new editions 
of all Chesnutt’s novels; they can 
make Jean Toomer break his long 
silence. They can bring new voices 
and new souls into the articulate 
world. 


CURRENT BOOKS 


66 HE Magic Island”, by W. C. 

Seabrook, (Harcourt, Brace 
and Company), is a story of Haitian 
life and religion. It is well and in- 
terestingly written with freedom of ex- 
pression and a certain gossipy intimacy. 
Our readers will like it, because it 
writes of the Negro with sympathy and 
with deep understanding of what op- 
pression has meant in the beautiful but 
unfortunate island which we _ have 
raped. The author has no difficulty 
in envisaging black men and women 
as human. On the other hand, the 
book is long drawn-out, and over- 
elaborated. One senses a basis of fact 
much more meager than 336 pages 
calls for. Almost, one gets the im- 
pression that it would have been bet- 
ter if the book had been compressed 
to half its size and toned down. It is 
accompanied, for reasons which only 
God knows, by distressingly ugly and 
crude caricatures conceived by Alex- 
ander King. . 


But the book is worth reading and 
the end is fine. The author has told 


May, 1929 





THE BROWSING READER 


of the massacre of prominent Haitians 
and the murder of the President which 
led to our intervention. He relates 
how one “‘grey-haired dapper little col- 
ored gentleman,” who had lost three 
grown sons in the massacre, called 
upon the guilty Commandant after- 
ward. And then the story is: 

“T am told that he sent in his card. 
I am told that Charles Oscar, who was 
a cruel man but not a coward, entered 
the drawing-room with a_ nervous 
smile. Be those things as they may, 
the little old gentleman shot him care- 
fully three times through the heart, 
one bullet for each of his dead sons .. . 

“At the precise hour when these 
events were occurring the American 
battleship Washington was steaming 
into the harbor. More than twelve 
years have passed, and the Americans 
have been in Haiti continuously ever 
since. The presence of the Americans 
has put an end to many things. It has 
put an end to revolution, mob violence, 
and many other deplorable conditions 


which the entire reasonable world’ 


agrees should be put an end to. It 
has also put an end, or if not an end, 
a period, to more than a century of 
national freedom of a peculiar sort, 
which has existed nowhere else on 
earth save in Liberia—the freedom of 
a Negro people to govern or mis- 
govern themselves, to stand forth as 
human beings like any others without 
cringing or asking leave of any white 
man. I do not understand these 
things. - But I think I understand 
something that was in the soul of the 
little gentleman who called at the Do- 
minican legation, and I hope we 
haven’t put an end to that too.” 

“Thirteen Days” by Jeannette 
Marks, (Charles and Albert Boni), 
is a story of the desperate efforts 
which liberal America made to save 
Massachusetts from murdering Sacco 
and Vanzetti. It is a tense record of 
the efforts between August 9, 1927 to 
August 22nd, 1927, to make the domi- 
nant American listen to reason and 
justice. It is worth reading. It makes 
us who are black realize just the kind 
of dead reaction we are fighting against 
in the United States. 

“Your long years of torture and 
your last hours of supreme agony are 


the living banner under which we and. 


our descendants for generations to 
come will march to accomplish that 
better world based on the brotherhood 


of man for which you died. In your. 








martyrdom we will fight on and con- 
quer.” : 

A symposium, “We Believe in Im- 
mortality” has been edited by Sydney 
Strong and published by Coward- 
McCann. Some ninety leaders of 
American life express themselves as be- 
lieving or not believing in a future 
life. Five Negro authors are included. 

L. G. E. Jenes, a lecturer of Ox- 
ford University, has been studying Ne- 
gro schools and has issued a pamphlet, 
“Negro Schools in the Southern 
States”, (Clarendon Press). It is a 
hasty ill-considered piece of work. He 
has visited Hampton, Tuskegee, St. 
Helena Island, and depended largely 
upon the Jones Report of Negro col- 
leges issued twelve years ago. The 
conclusions may not be far from the 
truth, but the history of the develop- 
ment of Negro education is curiously 
distorted. 

American Negroes ought by all 
means to read Savel Zimand’s “Living 
India”, (Longmans, Green and Com- 
pany). Mr. Zimand has had wide 
experience in the problems of oppressed 
peoples and he has written the kind 
of book which Negroes will under- 
stand, about the greatest race problem 
of the modern world. One quotation 
well illustrates both the author and the 
problem that he is studying. 


I remember one day getting into a 
railway third-class compartment for 
Indians, not reserved for Europeans. 
It was only half occupied. I wore my 
sun hat, and was surprised that no one 
else tried to enter the carriage, though 
the rest of the train was, as usual, 
desperately overcrowded. Travellers 
took one glance and then hurried off, 
struggling to squeeze in elsewhere. I 
asked one of my companions, a Vakil 
(country lawyer), to explain. 

“They are afraid of you,” said the 
Vakil. “They think you are English.”’ 

“But”, said I, “even if I were Eng- 
lish, I could not very well put out of 
the carriage people who have paid their 
fares as well as I have”. 

“That shows”, he said, “that you 
have not been very long in this coun- 
try, or you would know that the Eng- 
lish can do many things here not per- 
mitted by law”. He added, “If you 
take your sun hat off, you will look 
like a Parsee. See what happens”. 

He was right. As soon as I was 
bareheaded’ they came flocking in.

EUROPE 


@ On March 6, 1926, the Shake- 
spear Memorial Theater at Stratford- 
on-Avon, England, was destroyed by 
fire. The American Shakespeare 
Foundation is proposing to raise a 
sum of $1,000,000 to re-build this 
theater. Mr. James Weldon John- 
son is heading a Committee to place a 
memorial to the great Negro actor, 
Ira Aldridge, in this theater. 

@ The London Sunday Express said 
in a recent editorial: “The colored 
races, led by the Negroes of America, 
are going through a rapid period of 
transition. In the United States, the 
Negroes are developing at a surpris- 
ing rate.” 

@ The Spenser-Pryse pictures have 
been exhibited again in the Alpine Gal- 
lery, London. ‘They are striking pic- 
tures of black types in Nigeria. 

@ Africa was represented at the Brit- 
ish Quadrennial Conference of the 
Student Christian movement in Liver- 
pool last January. There were two 
thousand delegates, representing 
thirty-five countries. Abyssinia, Egypt, 
Uganda, The Congo, Nigeria, Gold 
Coast and South Africa had delegates. 
@ Lady Lugard, who wrote the in- 
teresting book “A Tropical Depend- 
ency” and who was the wife of Lord 
Lugard, is dead of pneumonia in Eng- 
land. Her maiden name was Flora 
Shaw. 

@ The Second World Congress of 








Dr. W. H. Johnson. 


the League Against Imperialism will 
be held in Paris, July 20, 1929. Mr. 
William Pickens will represent Amer- 
ican Negroes. 

@ Tours to Europe which especially 
invite colored people are those to Rus- 
sia under the Open Road, and the an- 
nual Hampton Institute Tour. 


THE EAST 


@ Archibald John Motley, a colored 
artist of Chicago, has been appointed 
to a Gugginsheim Fellowship. Eric 
Walrond has been re-appointed. The 


scholarships provide for a study abroad 
and amount to $2,500. 

@ Dr. William H. Johnson, who 
died recently in New York, was born 
at Sag Harbor, Long Island, in 1854. 
He was a descendant of Negroes and 
Indians. He received his medical de- 
gree from the University of Pennsy!- 
vania in 1885, and since then has prac- 
ticed in New York. 

@ At the New Haven Little Theater 
two Negro plays and a program of 
spirituals have been given. The plays 
were written by Mrs. Sara L. Fleming. 
@ Adelaide Hall was born in Brook- 
lyn and made her debut with Sissle and 
Blake in “Shuffle Along”. She played 
the principal female role in Miller and 
Lyle’s ‘Runnin’ Wild”, and in 1924 
went abroad and appeared in Germany, 
Norway and Austria. For some time 
she played in Chicago, and then signed 
a five-year contract under Lew Leslie 
and is now the leading lady in “The 
Blackbirds of 1928”. This latest of 
colored shows is unusually clean and 
beautiful, and has been running nearly 
a year upon Broadway. To all auditors, 
the center of attraction is Adelaide 
Hall. In many ways, Miss Hall is 
the successor of Florence Mills. 

@ The New York Chapter of the 
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority has 
awarded its 8th Scholarship of $150 to 
Miss Eunice Jackson of Brooklyn. 
Miss Jackson is majoring in Mathe-

36,505 churches and 4,558,798 mem-

with 644,692 colored members in 
thirty white organizations. The total 
annual expenditures for Negro churches 
are $42,024,259. Expenditures in 
1916, were $18,529,827. 


@ The West Virginia Legislature at 
its last session authorized the state to 
pay the tution of Negro students study- 





ing in professional or graduate schools 
outside of the state. It equalized the 
salaries of white and Negro teachers 
in all the public schools of West Vir- 
ginia, and changed the name of the 
West Virginia Collegiate Institute to 
West Virginia State College. The 
appropriations for Negro State Educa- 
tional institutions for the two years, 
beginning July, 1929, included $600,- 
000 for the West Virginia State Col- 
lege, $289,000 for Bluefield Colored 





Institute, $35,000 for Storer College, 
and $109,000 for the West Virginia 
School for the Deaf and Blind. Credit 
for much of this work should go to T. 
Edward Hill, colored member of the 
Legislature and W. W. Sanders, 
State Supervisor of Negro schools. 

@ R. Nathaniel Dett’s choir from 
Iiampton Institute gave a most suc- 
cessful concert in Symphony Hall, 
Boston. There were sixty singers, and 
the program included 15th and 16th 
Century church music, modern Rus- 
sian anthems, church music by Ameri- 
can composers, including Mr. Dett, 
and Negro melodies. The Boston 
Globe says that no chorus in recent 
years “has sung with subtler or finer 
artistry. .. . This chorus, like Roland 
Hayes, must be judged with no thought 
of race distinctions; it can take rank 
of right among the leading choruses of 
the world.” 

@ Twenty-four representatives from 
eight of the principal Negro church 
denominations met at Howard Uni- 
versity in March to consider and rec- 
ommend plans of co-operation. They 
proposed to found a National Co-oper- 
ative Committee of Negro churches. 
Dr. A. N. Townsend was Chairman 
and Dr. George E. Haynes, Secretary. 


THE MIDDLE WEST 
@ The “Full Crew” Law is now 
proposed in Illinois. This law, which . 
is enforced in many states, is an effort 
by members of the white Railway Un- 
ions to force Negro porters and 
workers out of the service of the rail- 
ways. It requires brakeman and flag- 
man in each minimum crew, and as 
Negroes cannot join either of these

the speakers were: Dr. A. M. May of 
Yale, F. L. Brownlee of the American 
Missionary Association, and Mr. C. H. 
Tobias of the National Y. M. C. A. 
The Conference decided that students 
are dissatisfied with the religious 
agencies in schools; they think that 
there is too much compulsion and regu- 
lation; too many empty religious 
forms, and that the present program 
fails to develop intelligent and effec-

THE 





CRISIS 








* 








2 


HOOVER AND THE SOUTH 
ERBERT HOOVER has started 


something. We very much doubt 
if he understands the ramifications of 
his late declaration. His statement is 
that Republican Presidents for many 
vears have tried to build up state Re- 
publican organizations in the Southern 
states; that this Southern Republican 
Party must “commend itself to the citi- 
zens of those states”; that the basis of 
sound government is a strong two- 
party representation; that there must 
be no sectionalism in politics; and that 
the re-organization must come “from 
the states themselves”. 

He then lists the states: North 
Carolina and Virginia have a Republi- 
can Party. Alabama, Arkansas, Louis- 
iana, Texas and Florida are strength- 
ening the Republican Party, and Mr. 
Hoover commends the movement. He 
puts Mississippi, South Carolina, 
Georgia and Florida on the black list, 
and says nothing about Tennessee. 

All this is singularly contradictory. 
By law, social and economic pressure, 
the formation of a real Republican 
Party has been resisted by the Solid 
South for a generation. The only 
movement which they have been will- 
ing to admit has been the forming of a 
white Republican Party, and it is this 
“Lily White” movement which is 
triumphing in everyone of the states 
which Mr. Hoover praises. Negroes 
have kept their hold in Mississippi, 
Georgia and Tennessee. And two of 
these states, Mr. Hoover, roundly con- 
demns. 

Very good. Does President Hoover 
include black citizens among those 
whose judgment must “commend” the 
re-organization? If the Perry How- 
ard and Ben Davis type of political 
morality does not suit him, does he not 
know a single decent Negro citizen in 
Georgia and Mississippi who can be 
trusted? And when re-organization 
must come from the states themselves, 
does this dominating local opinion in- 
clude poor black laborers or only rich 
white bankers? 

As a practical measure, suppose a 
Republican Party under white leader- 
ship and control grows up in the South- 
ern states? On whom must it depend 
for votes? Manifestedly, on Negroes. 


May, 1929 


Foskacrif-t 


—_——__—— 


Why should Negroes vote for “Lily 
Whites” in preference to voting for 
Bourbon Democrats? They must be 
offered something: offices, better 
schools, better living conditions, aboli- 
tion of “Jim Crow” cars. Something! 
If the Democrats and “Lily Whites” 
compete for the Negro vote, then only 
patience and brains are needed to bring 
Negro office holders and Negro suf- 
frage. If neither party offers anything, 
the new Republican Party can never 
exist, because it will be without votes. 
Even if its Federal patronage attracts 
any considerable body of votes from the 
white Democratic Party, the white 
Democrats can retaliate by inviting in 
the Negro voters, which is precisely 
what has happened in Tennessee. In 
this case, the Republicans, in  self- 
defense, have got to submit at least to 
a partial Negro leadership, and Robert 


R. Church of Tennessee maintains his ° 


position with the benediction of the 
President. 

Very well, an excellent program, 
says the country. But what does the 
Solid South say? The corrupt and 
ruthless hierarchy of Vardaman, Blease 
and Harrison who have made democra- 
cy in the United States impossible be- 
cause of its rotten boroughs? These 
leaders are the ones and not the Ne- 
groes who are angry beyond expression 
at this blow at white supremacy which 
Herbert Hoover has aimed at black 
men’s heads. 


THE CHICAGO DEBATE 


HERE was held in the Coliseum 

in Chicago in March a debate be- 
tween Lothrop Stoddard and the Edi- 
tor of THe Crisis on the question 
“Should the Negro be Encouraged to 
Seek Cultural Equality?” The debate 
was notable; first, because of the popu- 
lar interest which it aroused. Every 
one of the four thousand seats was 
taken and several hundred persons were 
unable to gain entrance. Probably 
one-third or more of the audience was 
white. Secondly, one noted the ap- 
parent disinclination of Mr. Stod- 
dard frankly to state his position. 
This is symptomatic of a widespread 
change in the attitude of white Amer- 


icans. It is becoming more and more 
difficult for them to state frankly the 
case against the Negro. The reason 
for this is that the main facts upon 
which they have been relying are no 
longer plausible and the thesis without 
them is barbarous, unscientific and un- 
christian. 

The Editor asked Mr. Stoddard in 
the debate: ‘““Why should not all peo- 
ple be encouraged to seek and reach 
the highest human culture?” And he 
intimated that the only plausible reason 
for denying them this privilege was the 
assumption that their inferiority was so 
great that they could never hope to 
reach the goal and would simply be 
made unhappy by striving. 


The obvious answer to this would 
be to say Yes and then to prove this 


-inferiority of the Negro. This, Mr. 


Stoddard did not do and did not at- 
tempt to do. The reason probably was 
that he realized that such attempted 
proof would not only lose him the sym- 
pathy of his black audience, but gain 
no particular enthusiasm from a thou- 
sand whites who themselves belonged 
mostly to laboring classes just as “‘in- 
ferior” to Mr. Stoddard’s Nordic super- 
man as the average American Negro. 


, Mr.-Stoddard, therefore, took refuge 

it two contentions: That differences 
between races should be maintained by 
a “bi-racial” arrangement, and that the 
social equality which would follow cul- 
tural equality could not be counten- 
anced. The Editor’s rejoinder was 
that “Bi-racialism’” could not and 
would not work in a modern world 
where the whites themselves had been 
foremost in breaking down race bar- 
riers ; and that social equality was civil- 
ized, inevitable and desirable among 
social equals, and not compulsory 
among others. : 


It was an interesting occasion; but 
the white man’s presentation of his 
side of the controversy was much 
weaker than it need have been. On the 
other hand, if it had been stronger, it 
would have been a public confession of 
a determination to stop human prog- 
ress. This is what the present domi- 
nant majority of white folk propose to 
do. But naturally they do not care 
to say so, openly, publicly and plainly.

MISSIONARIES 


HERE is a curious attitude on the 

part of religion in the United 
States and Europe toward American 
Negro missionaries. It is a little dif- 
ficult to get at all the facts, but a ques- 
tionnaire sent out among various mis- 
sionary organizations reveals the fol- 
lowing apparent situation: 

One of 158 African missionaries, the 
Protestant Episcopal Church has 1 
American Negro; the Presbyterian, 2 
out of 88; the Northern Baptists, | 
out of 20; the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, 5 out of 91; the American 
Board, 4 out of 97. 


Of 793 other missionaries to Africa 
sent out by American missionary so- 
cieties, including the United Presby- 
terians, the United Missionary Society, 
the United Brethren, the African In- 
land Mission, the Friends, the Bre- 
thren-in-Christ, the Southern Baptists, 
the Women’s General Mission Society 
of the United Presbyterian Church, 
the Lutherans, and the Sudan Interior 
Mission, there is not a single Ameri- 
can Negro! 

It would seem at first thought that 
the use of American Negroes to evan- 
gelize Africa would be not only a logi- 
cal but singularly poetic and satisfy- 
ing result of American slavery. In- 
deed, for centuries it was the main 
justification for that slavery on the 
consciences and lips of Christians. 

But careful inquiry among mis- 
sionary societies reveals today an as- 
tonishing state of mind. For instance, 
in the case of the African Inland Mis- 
sion: “The question has never been 
raised.” The United Missionary So- 
ciety says: ‘““The matter has not come 
before the Board.” The Foreign Mis- 
sionary Society of the United Brethren- 
in-Christ has ‘‘not made it a practice 
to send out American Negroes’; the 
American Friends Board of Foreign 


Missions has “never formulated any, 


policy concerning the sending to Africa 
of American Negroes as missionaries” ; 
the Foreign Mission Board of the 
Brethren-in-Christ, “have not had any 
applicants”; the Women’s General 
Missionary Society of the United Pres- 
byterian Church has “never discussed 
the matter”; the Missionary Society 
of the Evangelical Church has “no 
policy”! 

On the other hand, the Foreign Mis- 
sion Board of the Southern Baptist 
Convention is frank: “Our policy is 
not to send American Negroes as mis- 
sionaries’; also, the Sudan Interior 
Mission has a policy, and states it 
plainly: “Our brethren from the 
American Negro churches practically 
have to live on the same plane almost 
as their white brethren, and this creates 
a problem”; the American Bible So- 


168 


ciety scents some trouble and hastens 
to say: “I presume your inquiry is 
evoked by some thought that there may 
be racial discrimination asserted by the 
missionary agencies of the churches se- 
lecting missionaries. I have been more 
or less closely associated with mission- 
ary work in the last ten years and have 
never known of such a case.” Thus 
writes Mr. Eric North, who evidently 
does not dwell on earth but in a 
Heaven of his own. 


Most of the missionary societies who 
try to apologize for their discrimina- 
tion seek to explain their stand by say- 
ing that they are training “native” 
helpers. Certainly, this should be true. 
But why not use American Negroes 
as the obvious instruments for such 
training? The Presbyterian Church 
began sending Negro missionaries and 
then stopped. Only this year have they 
finally been induced to send two. The 
American Bzptist Foreign Mission So- 
ciety tries to put the whole onus upon 
Negro churches, and declares that 
“no qualified Negro applicants” have 
applied in recent years. If they should 
apply, the Society does not promise to 
send them, but only to give the matter 
“most careful consideration”. The 
Women’s General Missionary Society 
of the United Presbyterian Church 
says that “no action for or against the 
sending of Negroes to work as mis- 
sionaries in Africa has been taken. J 
can see complications that might be 
unpleasant and hard to surmount.” The 
Friends and others also admit the fact 
that several foreign governments, and 
especially the Belgian Congo, object to 
American Negroes. 


As a matter of fact, missionary so- 
cieties of the United States started out, 
for the most part, with the obvious 
policy of sending Negroes to convert 
Africa. Then they found out that this 
involved social equality between white 
and black missionaries; the paying of 
Negro missionaries on the same scale 
as white missionaries, and their pro- 
motion and treatment as civilized be- 
ings. With few exceptions, American 
white Christianity could not stand this, 
and they consequently changed their 
policy. Several of them stopped send- 
ing Negroes, altogether. Others tried 
to get their assistance from the natives, 
where discrimination in treatment and 
wages could be made without com- 
plaint; while still others intimated, as 
the American Baptist Foreign Mis- 
sionary Society puts it: “The failure 
of quite a proportion to live up to their 
all important moral obligations has nec- 
essarily been a serious consideration”, 
which is a chaste way of saying that 
American Negroes are too immoral to 
convert Africans to the kind of Chris- 
tianity which this Society has for sale. 


OPTIMISM 


OTHING is more dangerous than 

unintelligent optimism; childish 
faith in the triumph of good; the 
““God’s-in-His-Heaven” attitude, as- 
sumed because one is too lazy to be 
worried. On the other hand, the worst 
moral dyspepsia must face facts; and 
looking back on the history of the 
Negro race in America for the last few 
years one cannot help feeling a sense of 
tremendous encouragement. 

The legal defense of black men in- 
stead of being sporadic and occasional 
is taking definite, determined form and 
it is becoming increasingly difficult to 
cheat and oppress and mob colored 
people simply because they are colored. 

But this, after all, is merely nega- 
tive. Yet on the positive side there is 
even greater cause for self-congratula- 
tion. There is a new self-assertion 
which is not merely empty impudence. 
Quietly and unswervingly Negroes 
have laid down the law that their high- 
er institutions of learning can no longer 
be run regardless of colored folk’s 
ideals and desires. Again Negroes have 
begun to undertake their own self 
interpretation and are no longer con- 
tent merely to sit by, smiling delighted- 
ly, when some white outsider carelessly 
evaluates their history, their song, their 
hopes, their personal appearance. 

Following a rather sudden, almost 
hysterical renaissance of art among 
them, there is slowly coming a deter- 
mined Will-to-Create. Self-expression 
wells up among us even though it is 
not all of the highest order, and often 
lacks careful finish; it is nevertheless a 
true and sincere mirroring of new souls 
and valuable because of its sincerity 
and newness. 


In the economic field one senses in 
every part of the country, better home 
life, larger incomes and more careful 
spending. ‘The old ideal of imitating 
the extravagance of rich whites has not 
altogether passed but it is evidently 
passing. One finds little homes of cul- 
tured colored folk who are quite: will- 
ing to admit that they are living on 
one hundred dollars a month and really 
living. Children are crowding into 
high schools and colleges not simply 
because it is the thing to do but be- 
cause their parents are getting clear 
ideas of just what education -is for. 
There is a small new army of colored 
artisans who know the technique of 
their work and of the labor movement. 
And finallly, in the dull brain of white 
America it is beginning to become 
clearly evident that the most virile 
future force in this land, certainly in 
art, probably in economics and possibly 
in science is the Negro.

Beyond the Color Line 
(Continued from page 153) 


loathing the line, but not able to cross 
it or blot it out. 


OR many years I had been going 

to hear the students at Hampton 
Institute sing Negro spirituals. Like 
2 great ocean, the song reached out and 
up and on, carrying us all alike into 
vast spaces, holding us close to the 
tragedy and beauty and longing of 
life. And for a few minutes I knew 
spiritual unity with this people. 

But, the song over, and the meet- 
ing dispersed, I found myself a stranger 
among strangers. 

So here was the problem: How to 
translate into everyday actions the 
truth which art revealed ? 


UTH GORDON was my first 
Negro friend. A northern wo- 
man who had come south to teach 
among her own people, she was serv- 
ing as chairman of the colored branch 
of the Y. W. C. A. Manned with a 
little sociological theory and Christian 
philosophy, I had returned south in Y. 
W. C. A. industrial work, determined 
among other things to find a way out 
in inter-racial relationships. 

But ours was a friendship shadowed 
by the color line. 

We never met, except in her or my 
office. Once or twice after work I 
walked home with her, through the 
Negro section of town. By tacit agree- 
ment we avoided the white sections. 
Curious eyes followed us. . . . We 
parted at her door. She never asked 
me in, though I think she wanted to. 
And I longed to enter. To be treated 
as one of them, not as an alien, mem- 
ber of a despised and feared race. To 
give and receive such natural com- 
radeship as Bob and I had known as 
children. 

Ruth sensed this, I think, and did 
what she could. But we were still 
bound. Caste-bound. Each clutching 
at the line, but not ready to defy it and 
the world that placed it there. For we 
had been trained to believe that the 
way lay through Peace and Persuasion, 
Law and Order, and the all-power of 
Love. Through “changing men’s 
hearts”, one by one. Then social rela- 
tions would right themselves. . 

Finally for me there was no going 
on. The theory simply did not work. 
The system was stronger than individ- 
uals. Everywhere it pointed at me its 
accusing finger. Class system. Caste 
system. “Poor Whites’. Negrves. 
Man exploiting man. And all the 
while talking Brotherhood and De- 
mocracy. It seemed but a clever hoax. 

Perhaps the solution depended on

changing the system itself? 


So I rebelled. Resigned my job, and 
plunged into industry. 

Life as a wage-earner in a Phila- 
delphia clothing shop brought the an- 
swers I had been seeking. In our shop 
there were many nationalities: Italians, 
Germans, Russians, and Jews, and 
colored as well as white. But among 
us it made no difference. We were all 
workers, bound together in one great 
movement. Comrades and equals. 

It was a union shop and as we 
worked we sang above the roar of the 
machines, the labor songs of Italy, 
Russia or Germany, and sometimes a 
colored work song which Dabney had 
taught us. Dabney, our shop chairman 
and the most popular man in the plant, 
was a Negro. 

In the evenings after work, when 
there was no union meeting or labor 
gathering, DuBois, Marx and Lenin 
awaited my eager search. 

Here at last was a direction and 
meaning to life. A freedom to be 
fought for and won, black and white 
together. 





FEW weeks ago, two of us sat 
planning the details of an or- 
ganizing campaign among white and 
colored workers in the south. We dis- 
cussed at length the racial prejudices 
and customs of both groups, and ways 
of coping with them. And though one 
of us happened to be white of skin and 
one of us dark, neither remembered or 
cared about this fact. We were simply 
workers in a common cause. 

The last time I was south I went 
again to hear the Hampton students 
sing. Once more I sat in the gallery 
where the music rises up and engulfs 
one in its flow and depths. Once more 
I was swept on and out into the spirit- 
ual passion of this people. 

But now there was a difference. 
Now in the song there was more than 
pathos and yearning. More than the 
cry of an exploited race. There was 
promise. Promise of a time when this 
toiling people would march shoulder 
to shoulder with their white comrades 
and fellow-workers, beyond the color 
line, in labor and struggle for a new 
world.

offices by black Republicans in the 
South; but offices from the highest to 
the lowest have been regularly sold by 
white Republicans and white Demo- 
crats in the South and are being sold 
today. 

And yet, of all this, there must be no 
criticism, no exposure, no real investi- 
gation, no political revolt, because the

decent white South lacks the moral 
courage to expose and punish rascals 
even though they are white and to 
stand up for democracy even if it in- 
cludes black folk. 


I yield to no man in my admiration 
for what the new young South is do- 
ing in liberalizing race relations and 
humanizing thought, but I maintain 
that until the liberal white south has 
the guts to stand up for democracy 
regardless of race there will be no 
solution of the Negro problem and no 
solution of the problem of popular 
government in America. You cannot 
build bricks of molasses. 


Nor is this all. Because of the rotten 
boroughs of the South, real Demo- 
cratic government is impossible in the 
North. The Democratic Party cannot 
become a liberal body because the bulk 
of its support depends upon disfran- 
chisement, caste and rd@e hate in the 
South. It depends on minimizing par- 
ticipation in politics by all people, black 
and white, and stifling of discussion. It 
is the only part of the nation where the 
woman suffrage amendment is largely 
ignored and yet the white women do 
not dare to open their mouths to pro- 
test. 


So long as this party holds this grip 
on 114 electoral votes despite argu- 
ment, with no reference to dominant 
political questions and with no ref- 
erence to the way in which votes are 
actually cast, this party cannot be dis- 
placed by a Third Party. With no 
Third Party corrective for -a discred- 
ited minority, democratic government 
becomes simply impossible without 
something resembling revolution. 


RECENT ELECTIONS 


HEN in 1912 Roosevelt tried to 
appeal to liberal thought in the 
United States against the reactionary 
Republicans and the bourbon Demo- 
crats, he only succeeded in putting the 
Democrats in power. When La Fol- 
lette tried to do the same thing in 1924, 
he simply scared the country into larger 
reaction, since they realized that they 
had to choose between bourbon Democ- 
racy and organized privilege. 


In 1928, we had an extraordinary 
spectacle. It is too well-known for me 
to comment. I only remind the reader 
that the right of Southern white men 
to vote as they wished on public ques- 
tions was openly and vehemently de- 
nied and the right of dominant political 
cliques holding their power by dis- 
franchising four million white and 
black voters, to make their own elec- 
tion returns as to the vote cast, with- 
out state or national investigation or 
inquiry, was successfully maintained. 
This is the only modern nation in the 








world which does not control its own 
elections. 


THE FUTURE 

OW is all this going to be rem- 

edied? How are we going to re- 
store normal democracy in the United 
States? It is not a question of the 
millennium; of being able through 
democratic Government to do every- 
thing immediately. But it is a ques- 
tion, and a grave and insistent ques- 
tion, whether the United States of 
America is going to maintain or sur- 
render democracy as the fundamental 
starting point of permanent human up- 
lift. If democracy is still our corner 
stone, must it be smashed because of 
twelve million Negroes? Better cut 
their throats quickly and build on. 


On the other hand, if Democracy 
fails in the United States, and fails 
because of our attitude toward a 
darker people, what about Democracy 
in the world, and particularly in In- 
dia, in China, in Japan and in Egypt? 
We have got a chance today, and an 
unrivaled chance, again to rescue and 
guide the world, as we did at the end 
of the 18th Century. And we have the 


same kind of dilemma. 


In those days when we started to 
build a nation of equal citizens, Negro 
slavery could have been abolished ; its 
abolition was begun even in the South; 
but the respectable people, the smug 
people, sat down before it and organ- 
ized the American Colonization So- 
ciety, which was the interracial move- 
ment of that day; and instead of fight- 
ing evil they were content to congratu- 
late themselves on the good already ac- 
complished. In the long run, they did 
less than nothing. 


So today it is fortunate that people 
can sit down at Interracial Conferences 
and find so much to congratulate them- 
selves about in the improved relation 
between races, and the increased knowl- 
edge which they have of each other. 
But all of this is going to be of no 
avail in the crisis approaching unless 
we take advantage of the present de- 
sire for knowledge and willingness to 
study and willingness to listen, and at- 
tack the main problem which is and has 
been the question of political power for 
the Negro citizens of the United 
States. 


I do not for a moment minjmize the 
difficulty of inaugurating in a land but 
a generation removed from slavery, of 
universal suffrage which includes chil- 
dren of slaves. It is extraordinarily 
difficult and calls for patience and tol- 
erance. But my point is that the 
sooner we face the goal the quicker we 
will reach it. We are not going to 
make democracy in the South possible 
by admitting its impossibility and refus-

ing to study and discuss the facts. Let 
us first of all say, and broadcast the 
fact, that all Americans of adult age 
and sufficient character and intelligence 
must vote and that any interference 
with or postponement of this realiza- 
tion is a danger to every other Ameri- 
can—a danger to be attacked now and 
continuously and with dogged deter- 
mination with a clear avowal of inten- 
tion by every open-minded man. 

What then is called for? Facts. A 
foundation of actual fact concerning 
the political situation of Negroes; their 
voting, their representation in local, 
state and national government; their 
taxation, their party affiliation and 
subserviance to political machines; the 
economic nexus between political 
power and occupation and income. 

This study beginning with Negroes 
should extend to whites. We must 
lift the curtain from democracy and 
view it into the open. We must in- 
sist that politics is no secret, shameful 
thing known only to ward heelers and 
political bosses, and to the corporations 
who buy and sell them. Here is the 
greatest and most insistent field of 
scientific investigation open to the so- 
cial reformer. 


Savage or Serene 
(Continued from page 157) 


That lay their eggs, and sting and sing, 
And weave their petty cells and die.” 


Majestically sad and fatal, like the 
chastened music to which some doonfed 
army marches, is this advance through 
frustration and obscurity to death. Yet, 
if our clearest aims and highest im- 
pulses are encompassed by the imper- 
ceptible net of our own natures, we 
know at least the consciousness of 
battle. Still we are valiant, and life 
touches for brief moments the divine. 
Some few, by starts, renew the ancient 
war against themselves, work to give 
form and dignity to the savage and 
cheap filling of their lives. One may 
half escape the fatal antiquity of his 
nature by the indomitable sacrifice of 
a father. Out of the pain of desire, a 
woman finds, perchance, the awe of 
motherhood. From wrath and carnage, 
some purging Iliad; from the bitter 
sensuality of slavery, songs with some- 
thing of the fortitude of religion: 


“Like a tree planted by the water, 
I shall not be moved.”

dren to make a fire so that he could 
see what it was. Spider grabbed the 
pans and ate everything. 

That same night he went to Rab- 
bit’s house and inquired where he 
found the food. Rabbit told him all 
about the palm tree and his trip to 
the fairy’s house. In the morning 
Spider went to cut palm nuts. 

He took them and threw them into 
the water so that he might break the 
fairy’s house too. At once he went 
into the water and met the fairy. She 
asked him why he was there. 

“Oh,” said Spider, “it’s hungry 
time. I was looking for palm nuts 
and some fell into the water. I came 
te look for them.” 

The fairy said, “Your nuts broke 
my house. Please fix it.” 

Spider answered, “I don’t care about 
your house. Only give me something 
to eat.” 

The fairy said, “Get a grain of rice 
and cook it.” 

Spider took two big panfuls of rice. 
When he had cooked it there was only 
one grain. Spider was angry. He ate 
the one grain but was not satisfied. 
He attempted to take some more rice 
from the fairy’s bag. But as soon as 
he touched it it became empty. And 
he found himself floating in the river. 
He went home to his children empty 
handed. 


Watching 


HEY often send me to the store, 
And let me go alone, 
Yet peep and watch till I get back, 
Just why, I’ve never known. 


If they’re afraid I might get lost, 

Why do they send me then, 

And peep from windows and front doors 
Till I get back again? 

They ought to trust a child of four 

To run right to the grocery store. 


When they themselves go to the store 
No one looks out to see. 

Nobody ever watches then, 

Excepting only me, 

And I just watch grown folks because 
They're always playing Santa Claus.

THE Crisis 




































The birds with blue feathers, 
The blooms with blue eyes, 
The pink buds and red ones 
That blush like sunrise. 


Swing gold cocoons open. 
Let moths mauve and blue 
Spread out their wings proudly 
And softly pass through. 
Then mull every fragrance, 
The lilac, the mint, 

The fruit blossom perfumes, 
The violet’s faint hint, 

And toss them to waver 
With mists of the spring 
Till even the soft dove 

Shall wake up and sing. ’ 





Flute 


F you knew the dew 

Was piping to you 
In its little cold strain, 
Would you wake up again, 
Roses wan, 
And catch joy at sunrise 
From the scarlet stained skies 
Till you glowed as the dawn?

tered. I tried this several times, and 
it worked. 

A trifling incident, you will say, 
and perhaps rightly. But multiply it, 
see similar things happening every day 
and hour, vear in and year out for 
generations, and you begin to under- 
stand why so many in India, of all 
castes and races, are today so irritated 
and exasperated by British rule. 

Lajpat Rai is dead, a martyr to 
British intolerance; but before he died, 
he published a reply to Katherine 
Mayo’s ‘“Mother India”, which was a 
fine and worthy defense of a great peo- 
ple. Lajpat Rai understood and wrote 
about the Negro problem in America 
and his book “Unhappy India” is team- 


ing with facts and unanswerable argu- - 


ments. 

D. D. T. Jabavu’s “The Segregation 
Fallacy and Other Papers”, comes 
to us from South Africa, (Lovedale 
Institution Press). Mr. Jabavu is a 
leader of South African Natives,—a 
very conservative and religious leader, 
but honest and sincere withal, and a 
man of education. His little book is 
“a native view of some South African 
inter-racial problems”. And he asks, 
a bit timidly and yet clearly: 

“Young educated Africa appeals for 
sympathy with her legitimate aspira- 
tions towards religious autonomy; for 
the dissemination of liberal views in 
press, pulpit and platform on the right 
of the Bantu to a happy future in the 
land of their birth; for protection in 
the settlement of land questions so

inseparably bound up with the princi- 
ples of religion; for the inculcation of 
Christian principles on Native affairs 
in white homes, schools, farms, towns, 
or clubs; for the kind of life thar 
Jesus would have led had he lived as 
a white man today in South Africa.” 

Roark Bradford’s “This Side of 
Jordan”, (Harper and Brothers), is 
pure rot.

School. 
@ Ohio Hall, a new Boy’s Dormi- 


tory, costing $85,000 is nearly com- 
pleted, at the Fort Valley High and 
Industrial School, Fort Valley, 
Georgia. 


@ At a book exhibition carried on by 
a department store in Atlanta, Georgia, 
Negro authors were among those fea- 
tured. 

@ In Jacksonville, Florida, a Negro 
charged with a misdemeanor was shot 
by the policeman and then paraded, 
wounded and bleeding, through the 
street until finally he was carried to a 
hospital where he is in danger of death. 


@ In North Carolina, colored one- 
teacher schools have decreased from 
2,376 in 1901 to 1,125 in 1927. The 
two-teacher schools have increased 
from 338 to 705 between 1915 and 
1927, and three-teacher schools from 
65 to 269 in the same period. There 
is still apparently almost no transpor- 
tation for colored childrén in the 
state. 

@ The Colored Wage Earners’ Sav- 
ings Bank failed over a year ago in 
Savannah, Georgia, and the State 
Banking Department sued the Direc- 
tors for $227,215. An Auditor was 
appointed and last week the Directors 
were assessed $104,629. The case 
will now have to be approved by the 
Judge and then the Directors can have 
the case tried before a jury if they 
wish. ‘There was no charge of per- 
sonal dishonesty. 

@ Mrs. Sallie W. Wiggins of Yancy- 
ville, North Carolina, a prominent 
white woman, died in Baltimore re- 
cently and left a large part of her 
$100,000 estate to Mrs. Sallie Graves, 
her Negro servant. 

@ For the year 1927-28, the white 
schools of North Carolina had prop- 
erty valued at $90,772,114, and the 
Negroes at $10,157,251. The value 
per child attending was $150. for the 
whites, and $31. for the Negroes.

@ There are in North Carolina, 748 
high schools for whites and 108 for 
Negroes. Of these, 551 of the white 
high schools are accredited, and 41 of 
the Negro high schools. 

@ Meharry Medical College is mov- 
ing in close proximity to Fisk Uni- 
versity. The site has already been 
bought, and will run approximately 
from 18th to 21st Avenue, North, and 
from Heffernan to Albion Street. The 
general idea will be to produce a plant 
after the latest ideas in medical educa- 
tion and similar to the new medical 
buildings of Vanderbilt University. 
Provision will be made for the four 
branches of instruction, namely: medi- 
cine, dentistry, pharmacy and nurse 
training. The home for iurses will be 
in close proximity with the other build- 
ings, but under a separate roof and 
will accommodate at least 65 nurses, 
in training, and 8 or 10 supervisors 
and instructors. The General Educa- 
tion Board and the Rockefeller group, 
are to raise one and a half million dol- 
lars, and the Rosenwald Fund has 
agreed to give a quarter of a million 
dollars, making a total of one and 
three-quarters of a million. The esti- 
mated cost of the grounds, the build- 
ings and the equipment will be around 
two million dollars. These Boards 
feel very strongly that the alumni of 
the college, the Negro people and 
friends of the institution should raise 
the other quarter of a million. 

@ The Dining Hall of the Florida 
Baptist Industrial and Agricultural In- 
stitute at St. Augustine, Florida, has 
been completely destroyed by fire. N. 
W. Collier is Principal. The school 
has a thousand acres of land and had 
just erected $50,000 worth of new 
buildings. 

@ The State Board of Control of 
Education in Florida has recommended 
appropriations of $3,000,000 for two 
state white schools and less than 500,- 
000 for the Negro school. There 
were in Florida in 1920, 329,487 Ne- 
groes out of a total population of 968,- 
470. 


THE SOUTH WEST 

@ Coy Stevenson of Cleo Springs, 
Arkansas, is a prominent farmer, own- 
ing three quarter sections of land and 
sixty-one head of full blooded cattle. 
Recently, he and his wife drove to 
Oklahoma City in their automobile 
and visited the zoo at North East Lake 
Park. This is a public park, sup- 
ported by general taxation, but the 
Stevensons were told by the attendant: 
“We don’t allow .Niggers in here,”

seed among the natives. Now that the 
crop has become so large and im- 
portant, a number of white English- 
men are claiming the honor of intro- 
ducing the culture. 

@ Mr. Samuel J. Forster was born 
at Bathurst, Gambia, British West 
Africa in 1873. He was educated at 
the local schools and in England, re- 
ceiving his B. A. from Merton Col- 
lege, Oxford, in 1896, and later his 
M. A. and B. C. L. He was called to 
the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1898. 
He practiced as Barrister and Solicitor 
in the Supreme Court at Bathurst from 
1899 and was a member of the Legisla- 
tive Council and Justice of the Peace. 
He received the order of M. B. E. in 
1897, and has been acting recently as 
Police Magistrate. 


SOUTH AFRICA 


@ There are as many natives in 
Johannesburg as Europeans, but the 
natives are not allowed upon the regu- 
lar street cars and must often walk 
five or six miles to and from their 
work. There are a few special cars 
for them but they run only intermit- 
tently. 

@ The Portuguese Government has 
adopted plans for constructing a bridge 
across Zambesi River. This will con- 
nect the railways of South and East 
Africa. 

@ The recent National European- 
Bantu Conference held at Capetown 
is described by its Chairman, Mr. Ho- 
ward Pim, as ‘‘a landmark in the his- 
tory of South Africa.” Three such 
conferences have been held, the first at 
Johannesburg in 1923, called by the 
Dutch Reformed Church. Among the 
leading natives at the recent confer- 
ence were D. D. T. Jabavu, Dr. 
James Moroka, John L. Dube, Mrs. 
C. M. Maxeke, (Charlotte Manye), 
and the Reverend Z. R. Mahabane. 
The Conference asked for more land 
for the natives, agricultural schools, a 
land bank and co-operative credit, 
equal rights in industry and work, 
better justice in the courts, the repeal 
of the Pass Laws, and better hospital 
facilities.
