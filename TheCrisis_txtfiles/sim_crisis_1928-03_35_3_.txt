KRIGWA, 1928 


THE CRISIS takes pleasure in announcing for the year 1928, $1,350 
in prizes. These prizes fall in two parts. First: 


THE CHARLES WADDELL CHESNUTT HONORARIA 
Prizes of $50 each month, $600 for the year 


A friend gives us $600 for prizes in Literature and Art. This sum goes to extend the idea of the Charles Waddell Chesnutt 
Honoraria which we established last year. The prizes are named in honor of the Dean of modern American Negro literature, 
Charles Waddell Chesnutt, who will be seventy years old in 1928. He began to contribute his stories to the ATLANTIC MONTH- 
LY in 1887, over forty years ago. Between 1899 and 1905 he published four novels which transformed the meaning of the black 
man in literature: “The Wife of His Youth” in 1899, “The House Behind the Cedars” in 1900, “The Marrow of Tradition” 
in 1901 and “The Colonel’s Dream” in 1905. We are happy to learn that next year a new novel is expected from Mr. Chesnutt’s pen. 


In honor of this man we distributed for 1927, $350 in prizes for the best articles published in THE CRISIS. This year we are 
going to expand this idea. Of the articles and drawings of any sort which THE CRISIS accepts and publishes in any month, 
written or done by persons not officially connected with the staff, we are going to select each month three for prizes. For the First 
Prize, $25; for the Second Prize, $15; for the Third Prize, $10. We shall thus distribute $600 for contributions appearing in 
THE CRISIS between April, 1928 and March, 1929. 


There is here no limitation of subject, length or kind of treatment; but the article must have been accepted by the Editors of 
THE CRISIS and published. 


Drawings which have been accepted and published as illustrations or covers will be considered for the prizes. The decision as to 
which contribution merits a prize will rest with the Editors, but they invite written comment from the readers and will give such 


comments careful consideration. 
THE ECONOMIC PRIZES 


Eight colored banks and five colored insurance societies have promised us $750 for prizes on Negro economic development. 
“The economic development of the Negro in the last two decades has been phenomenal and it is time that the new development of 
Art and Literature among us should be linked up with the economic trend.” 


The following Negro business organizations contributed to these prizes: 


INSURANCE COMPANIES 


The Liberty Life Insurance Company, Chicago. 

The National Benefit Life Insurance Company, Washington. 
The North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham. 
The Northeastern Life Insurance Company, Newark. 

The Southern Aid Society, Richmond. 

The Supreme Life and Casualty Company, Columbus. 

The Victory Life Insurance Company, Chicago. 


BANKS 
The Binga State Bank, Chicago. 
The First Standard Bank, Louisville. 
The Peoples Finance Corporation, St. Louis. 
The Prudential Bank, Washington. 
The St. Lukes Penny Savings Bank, Richmond. 


We are offering with this sum prizes for short stories, essays or cartoons, which will illustrate or study or tell the story of 
the economic development of the Negro: of Negroes as laborers, as farmers, as skilled workers, as business men, in all the different 
lines of business. We are going to leave the field wide and lay down no limitations as to treatment. The articles should be of 
such length that each can be published in five or less of the printed pages of THE CRISIS. 


The prizes offered for 1928 will be as follows: 


One First Prize $200 
One Second Prize $150 
One Third Prize $100 
Two Fourth Prizes $50 each 
Eight prizes for Honorable Mention $25 each 
A total of $750 


The Contest opens April First and entries close December 31, 1928. Results will be announced in the early spring of 1929. 
Do not use pen-names; write your own name and address plainly on each manuscript. No manuscript will be returned under 


any circumstances. Keep a copy and send no stamps. Drawings if accompanied by sufficient postage will be returned in the spring 
of 1929. 


Each entry upon receipt will be acknowledged by postal card. 
The Editors of THE CRISIS in consultation with the donors will decide upon the prize winners. 
We should be glad to correspond with persons who wish further information concerning Krigwa, 1928.

Bathesda of Sinners Run 


A Story By MAUDE IRWIN OWENS 


T was like reading the Books of 
| Chronicles, to read in the Thornton 
family history of the attending succes- 
sion of slave women that formed the 
single line of Bathesda’s ancestry. The 
Thorntons had always boasted of their 
seven generations of slave housekeep- 
ers who had directly descended from 
the housekeeper of the first American 
Thornton. They would proudly 
point out the precious, faded entries, 
so faithfully recorded in the old gene- 
ology. The paternal side of the issue 
was always politely ignored in strict 
accordance with the manners and cus- 
toms of the South. 

The scapegrace younger son of an 
English baron, Richard Thornton, was 
founder of the family. When gam- 
bling debts and foul dueling forced 
him to flee his native land, he decided 
upon the colony of George II under 
Governor Oglethorpe. His first slave 
purchase was written in two sentences, 
which seemed to wink and laugh up 
at the reader with its tan ink and 
old fashioned lettering. It read: 

“On this day did I barter my gold 
hilted sword, some lace and several 
shillings to that villain from the Vir- 
ginia colony whom I do sorely despise 
—for a black wench to cook my por- 
ridge, brew my tea and wash my linen. 
She is comely withal and methinks, 
the temper of a noble blooded colt; 
so I have named the vixen, Jezebel.” 

From this Jezebel on the issue 
became mulatto and less mulatto: for 
it was written that Jezebel foaled a 
likely mustard-colored filly whose 
father and master, with malicious hu- 
mor, named for his King and the col- 
ony. 


O Jezebel became the mother of 
Georgie; who begat Abigail; 
whose brat was Callie; whose offspring 
was Ruth; whose child was Viney; 
whose daughter was Anne; and 
twenty years after slavery, came Ba- 
thesda. 

To the utter amazement and cha- 
grin of her erstwhile master and mis- 
tress, when the bell of freedom tolled 
for those in bondage, Anne betook her- 
self from under the Thornton roof, 
in spite of all the inducements and 
cajoleries the Thorntons offered. 

She married Enoch Creek, a fusion 
of Creek Indian, Negro and white 
and who chose to select his surname 
from the Indian blood which domi- 
nated his being. He was a bitter man, 
having no faith or belief in mankind 


March, 1928 


or the institutions and principles of 
mankind; a religion of hatred that 
banned all but Anne and much later, 
little Bathesda. 

They founded a tiny home at Sin- 
ners Run, the Negro suburb of Thorn- 
tonville, Georgia, that had been called 
after a famous camp-meeting revival 
sermon preached there, years back. 
Their cabin was a little apart and 
elevated from the other huts and 


and goings of those who lived upon it. 

Anne attended the Sinners Run 
Baptist Church regularly and prayed 
that her husband find salvation. Enoch 
traded at the store because it was 
necessary—but after that, all socializ- 
ing with their neighbors ceased; un- 
less in the case of illness, when Anne 
was administering angel and healer 
of the small community. Within her 
lean yellow hands was the strange, 





“Becky took Li'l Jim up to see Bathesda regularly” Page 79 


shacks of the Sinners Run people, so 
that they could look down upon the 
road which was alternatingly red clay 
or yellow mud and note the comings 


soothing power to allay pain, and from 
her husband, she learned much of the 
Indian mysteries of roots and herbs 


for medicinal use.

HEY were thrifty and got along. 
For twenty years they worked, 
saved, improved their little two room 
home, and the acre upon which it 
stood. Anne was an expert needle- 
woman as Viney, Ruth and Callie had 
been before her; and she was in great 
demand in all the big houses down in 
Thorntonville. Enoch hired himself 
out as a plantation farmer, and in 
spite of his scowling silence, was 
known as a good hand. 

Then, at the age of forty—when all 
hope of bearing the traditional one 
girl-child had flown from the heart 
of Anne, it happened; and Bathesda 
made her advent into the life of Sin- 
ners Run. 

Enoch smiled for the first time— 
his squinting Indian eyes snapping with 
delight at the yellow gypsy-like Anne 
in the role of Madonna, with the ro- 
bust little papoose that was his. Of 
course the Thorntons got wind of it, 
investigated and greedily annexed one 
more generation to old Jezebel’s de- 
scendants, although the essence of re- 
flected glory had lost its flavor since 
the inconvenient Emancipation. The 
distinction of being the first of her 
line born out of slavery, was the most 
disgraceful thing that could have been 
written about Bathesda, into the sa- 
cred Annals, according to Thornton 
opinion. 

Two weeks later, Enoch stepped on 
a rusty spike. Blood-poisoning set in 
and, in spite of their combined knowl- 
edge of medicine and healing — his 
time had come to leave Anne and Ba- 
thesda, before Anne had convinced 
him there was a God. 


NNE turned from the unmarked 

grave, and faced the world alone 
with her baby, unflinchingly—with 
that calm independence that asked no 
pity. She went about her sewing at 
the houses of her patrons, for a while, 
carrying her infant with her. 

But as Bathesda began to toddle 
about, Anne realized her child should 
have home life, and be allowed to play 
in the vegetable patch and flower gar- 
den which Enoch had so painstakingly 
planted. So Anne took only work 
such as she could do at home, and her 
little daughter grew to be the marvel 
of the country side—a healthy, lovely 
child. 

She attended the broken down 
school-house to be taught by a wizened 
old maid from Connecticut a few 
months a year, and she sat at her 
mother’s knee, during the school pe- 
riod . . . both struggling eagerly to 
master a clear fluent English. Anne, 
being ardently religious, insisted that 
the little girl read her Bible and at- 
tend church regularly, in which she 
was reluctantly obeyed. 


78 


Thus Bathesda grew up to woman- 
hood. Beautiful—of deep-rooted in- 
telligence handicapped by inadequate 
schooling, a pagan love for the gor- 
geous wonders of Nature and a pas- 
sion for all things artistic. She be- 
came adept at the fine French seams 
and hemming; learned to feather- 
stitch the picturesque quilts on the huge 
frame, to weave highly imaginative 
Indian designs out of the bright silken 
rags into rugs and mats, to make the 
difficult Yankee hook rug, the knowl- 
edge of which had been introduced 
South by a Yankee Thornton bride; 
and best of all, she became an expert 
copier of the old ante-bellum samplers. 
Anne’s sampler embroidering frame 
looked worm-eaten—it was so old; and 
Bathesda considered it with great rev- 
erence. 


HEY made a picture to be remem- 
bered, sitting together at their 
artistic labors—the older woman and 
her daughter. Anne _ invariably 
talked religion to Bathesda having 
sensed a silent indifference which be- 
spoke much of Enoch’s atheism. When 
at the stuffy little church, the sermon 
had become highly exhortive, and the 
worshiper’s down-trodden souls burst 
forth in howling primitive devotion to 
a God they desperately believed in— 
even when great tears spilled down 
her quiet mother’s cheeks, Bathesda’s 
sole reaction was a disdainfully cold 
squinting of her pretty black eyes. 

“Tt’s Enoch! It’s Enoch!” mourned 
old Anne, as she watched the child of 
her old age flower into radiant woman- 
hood with no change of heart. 

“But Mother,” Bathesda would say, 
“vou take on so "bout nothin’. Ain’t 
we happy? We have always been dif- 
ferent from them in our way of livin’ 
and doin’ things and so how can you 
expect me to be like them in their 
church doin’s? You are not like them 
when you feel the spirit, Mother. You 
cry a little bit, but I have never seen 
you rear and tear and stomp and 
scream ‘halleluliah’ like someone crazy. 
. . .I hate it! My church is the purple 
mist stealin’ ahead of the red dawn— 
the chirpin’ wood-chucks; wild wood 
blossoms! If I ever ‘get religion’ 
Mother ’twill be in that kind of 
church, and not among the sweaty, 
hysterical hypocrites of your church. 
Why! I believe to my soul, Mother, 
you are the only real Christian among 
them, and do the least testifyin’!” 

“Child—you don’t understand. It 
is as real with them as life itself! It is 
given to each to work out his own des- 
tiny in the Lord, in his own way. It 
is the feelin’ that they are weak and 
sinful that overpowers them so—in 
their strivin’ to follow the Good 
Book.” 


“T don’t care "bout them anyways, 
Mother. We are better colored folks 
. that’s all. It just ain’t in them 
to be better. Look at their homes! 
Bare plank floors that all their scrub- 
bin’ and scourin’ don’t improve; walls 
plastered with newspapers full of pic- 
tures that they think are pretty; 
gunny-sacks tacked up to the windows 
. ugh! Give them their winter 
supply of potatoes, rice and hog meat 
. let them go to church and give 
chitterlin’ suppers plenty of 
shoutin’ and back-bitin’ and they are 
happy all winter long, Mother. But 
—look at our home!” 


HE waved her pale brown hand 

proudly around the room in which 
they sat. The walls were whitewashed. 
The floor was covered with a huge rag 
rug rich with colorful stripes and the 
single square window was draped with 
deep rose curtains that fluttered happily 
in the breeze. They had been made 
from flour bags soaked in kerosene to 
remove the printing, and dyed with 
berry juice. There were two fine old 
pieces of colonial mahogany in this 
outer room—a gigantic highboy and a 
marble-topped medicine chest. The 
other articles of furniture were three 
rush-bottomed chairs and a table that 
Enoch had made, and carved all over 
with the wierdly grotesque totem-pole 
gargoyles. Upon the mantel over the 
fireplace were a brilliant basket and 
two odd potteries also relics of the 
Creek strain in the father of Bathesda. 
Small painted tubs and cans were in 
interesting groups about the room, 
filled with plants of various sorts. 

“T don’t suppose I should say I hate 
them, Mother dear,” Bathesda con- 
tinued, “but I can get along without 
them. I shall do as you have always 


done . . . when they’re sick, I’ll make 
them well if they call upon me—but I 
don’t . . . I can’t be one of them in 


religion or otherwise.” 

“Ah, my child,” sadly smiled Anne, 
“you may have inherited the sense of 
medicine from Enoch, your father, but 
the Divine gift of healing can never 
descend upon a disbeliever . . . and 
you are the first of us women who has 
not been born with the gift since 
Mother Jezebel. She, even in her early 
day, was a Christian convert.” 

At this, Bathesda would shake her 
head impatiently as if flinging aside 
the admonitions of her mother, and the 
two long black braids would flare 
about her arms and shoulders. Then, 
bowing earnestly over her work, she 
would concentrate upon the exact 
copying of probably old Viney’s intri- 
cately designed sampler with the words 
—*“Little flakes make the biggest 
snow”, ordered by an antique dealer 
from Savannah. 


THE Crisis 





ne¢ 



























































A EE Ae LT TT TT TTT, is: tage ELT TT Tang 





ATHESDA’S mother died in her 

sixtieth year, and never had there 
heen such a funeral in the history of 
Sinners Run. Unlike her husband 
who had only a faithful wife and new 
born babe to follow him to his grave— 
the entire countryside turned out to do 
honor to Anne Creek. All of the pres- 
ent generation of Thorntons came 
from their town house in Savannah, in 
full force, much to the awe of the 
Sinners Run folk. They even hinted 
about how appropriate and fitting it 
would be if Anne. were buried beside 
Viney, in Thorntonville; but Bathesda 
was obdurate. 

“Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Thorn- 
ton, but my mother’s place is beside her 
husband. My father has been alone 
out there, long enough.” 

So the Thorntons had a second les- 
son in Negro independence. 

“Promise me, my daughter, that you 
will seek Jesus!” gasped Anne in her 
last consciousness. ‘Go to the church 
—seek Him until you find Him . 
and He will give you your birthright 
like he has given it to all the rest of 
us. Promise your poor old Mammy, 
Bathesda . . . baby!” 

And so she had promised to seek re- 
ligion and the power to heal the sick. 

Bathesda lived on, as the years 
rolled by, much as when Anne. lived. 
She made beautiful things with her 
graceful slender hands, and more 
money than she needed in her simple 
mode of living. She lived alone with 
the spirit presences of her parents, ex- 
cept for the loyal protection of a 
watch dog. She cared for the gay 
little ower garden tenderly and kept 
her graves freshly decorated in flower 
season. She grew her vegetables, also 
the roots and herbs with which she con- 
cocted her famous medicinal recipes. 
She attended the Sinners Run Baptist 
Church and contributed to its support; 
but the Indian in her worshipped only 
the wonders of Nature and she put no 
other gods before the beauty of the 
earth. 


HE colored people of Sinners Run 

envied and hated her, yet main- 
tained a deceitful courtesy that per- 
mitted them to call upon her when in 
need of intervention with white peo- 
ple, money or in sickness. Her ability 
to always smooth the way for them, in 
any form of distress, was known with 
a certainty that was uncanny to their 
superstitious minds. She could do all 
except smooth out actual pain like her 
mother had done. However, she did 
her all, in the name of Anne. . . she 
herself caring little for these crude 
mean-hearted and petty people, who 
grinned in her face for favors, and 
hissed “half white bastard” behind her 
back. This last amused her, however,

since her intelligence allowed her to 
see no difference between the black and 
yellow progeny of the illicit unions of 
slavery. 

“What queer religion these folks 
have,” laughed the woman, “it breaks 
forth in a certain place, and at a cer- 
tain fixed time, then they lose it ’til 
the next time.” 

The women were especially in- 
censed against her, because—if they 
married at all, they invariably married 
men who Bathesda had rejected. She 
allowed each suitor in his time, to visit 
her, sit as long as he pleased admiring 
her at the embroidering rack, while 
she, with serene. indifference, hoped he 
would make his departure in time for 
her to take her dog and go to the crest 
for the sunset, or some such solitary 
jaunt. She could say “no” with a cool 
pleasantness that retained their good- 
will; but the wives to whom she gave 
the men up, hated her venemously for 
30 doing. Hated her for wrapping her 
long glossy braids around and around 
her head in a coronet which made her 
a queen among them. Hated her for 
appearing so youthful despite her for- 
ty-seven years. Hated her for not 
shouting at church, and for failing to 
testify or profess. Hated her for hav- 
ing the prettiest house and garden in 
the community—for making the medi- 
cine that cured them. Hated her for 
weaving and embroidering while they 
took in washing, or labored beside 
their men in the cotton and corn fields. 
Hated her for her chaste aloofness of 
man, while they bore large families in 
the morass of poverty and misery. 
Hated her for showing contempt for 
the edicts of fashions and mail order 
houses up North or the cheap stores 
in Thorntonville and Savannah and 
for wearing the simply made, richly 
embroidered garments which none 
could duplicate. For all these reasons, 


the women of Sinners Run despised 
Bathesda. 


MONG them, she had one sin- 

cere friend in the person of 
young Becky Johnson. The dark- 
skinned girl had sought Bathesda in 
a frenzy one stormy midnight. 
Bathesda had donned her cape and ac- 
companied the wild young mother to 
the bedside of her baby who was 
strangling with dyptheria. It was a 
simple deed; the swabbing of the little 
throat with boiled vinegar and salt, 
with a few directions, but the brown 
girl had hugged Bathesda’s knees and 
kissed her comfortably shod feet in 
feverish adoration. ‘The father, too, 
had looked dumb gratitude with brim- 
ming eyes. After this incident, Becky 
took Li’l Jim up to see Bathesda regu- 
larly, and Bathesda became greatly at- 
tached to the small family, such devo- 











tion from Becky having awakened 
within her cold nature, something akin 
to affection. 

Becky’s sister, mother and grand- 
mother, strongly disapproved of this 
friendship. The sister, whose name 
was Cisseretta, was somewhat of a 
belle, and when rigged up in the cast- 
off clothes of the white people for 
whom she worked, was, for Sinners 
Run, quite elegant. She was light 
brown, with hazel eyes that were sly 
and coquettesh. Her hair was of that 
yellowish cotton-batten sort, known as 
riney. She meant to marry better than 
had her older sister, and scorned the 
field hands as prospective husbands, 
although she was not averse to keeping 
them from dancing attendance on the 
less discriminating girls of her set. 

The mother, Eliza Lambert, was 
about Bathesda’s age and a malicious 
“ves” woman to gossip and trouble 
making, although too stupid herself to 
even instigate a healthy lie. 


HE grandmother, Granny Lou, 

was an ancient crone, black as 
pitch, who had lost trace of her age, 
but knew everything pertaining to a 
scandalous nature concerning the fam- 
ilies of both races for miles around. 
She sat in one corner year in and year 
out, wrapped in filthy shawls and 
hoods summer and winter, smoking her 
foul clay pipe, and spitting snuff into 
the maw of the tumble-down stove, or 
gumming her vicious old tales. She 
was reputed to be the oldest woman 
in that section of Georgia, and to have 
borne more children than she herself 
knew; Eliza, being her youngest, to 
whom she had hitched herself. Just 
as most of the trouble making and un- 
der-current of evilness in the neighbor- 
hood could usually be traced to the 
chair of Granny Lou and Lambert 
household, so was she guilty of incit- 
ing most of the fierce antipathy among 
the women, against Bathesda. 

One particular early autumn morn- 
ing, she pursed and screwed her 
shrunken lips around to settle the snuff 
and saliva making a “Mpwhumn- 
mpwhumn” noise, and began lisping to 
Eliza who was washing: 

“Heh, heh! Ah sees whar dat-ar 
new ministah done gine sottin’ up to 
Thesdy’s already—heh, heh! ’Pears 
lak to me dat you ’omans ain’t slaves 
no moah an’ oughten’t go fer to put 
up wid sich cayyin’ on. Lize . . . 
Yo’ Cissy tryin’ to sot huh cap foah 
him, but ’pears lak to me, effen she 
gits him, won’t be twell dat Thes- 
day’s chawed ’im up an’ spat him back 
at huh! Heh, heh!” and as if to suit 
the word with the action, she spat into 
the pink wood ashes which were fall- 
ing out of the stove pit.

The Flood, the Red Cross and the National 


MISSISSIPPI 
Helping the Planters 


HERE the need was shown the 

Red Cross furnished seed and 
feed for stock until a crop could be 
produced. Two crops were destroyed 
this year by flood and one by army 
worms and cut worms. Some 
planters put in cotton in July 
on the chance of an unprece- 
dentedly late fall. Seed for 
these as well as alfalfa, soy 
beans, sorghum, cow peas and 
similar feed crops - was fur- 
nished by the Red Cross. Part 
of these were lost by the 
drought in September but 
enough has been saved to fur- 
nish feed for the stock for the 
coming year, barring further 
disaster. 

The first plan of the Red 
Cross was to do no rebuilding 
on plantations of over 200 
acres, the assumption being that 
the owners of such plantations 
could replace their own losses. 
After Mr. Hoover’s survey in Septem- 
ber this plan was changed and an ap- 
propriation was made to cover rebuild- 
ing and planting on all plantations ex- 
cept those which are company owned 
and therefore investment property. An 
agreement has been obtained from the 
companies holding the mortgages on 
these plantations extending the loan 
payments and interest and promising 
not to foreclose for a reasonable time. 
The planters hope that this rebuilding 
which includes repairs on damaged 
houses will check the migraton. 
However, few Negroes will go into 
the Delta until the flood season of next 
vear is well over. 


The Small Farmer 


HERE were many owners of 

small holdings from 20 to 60 acres 
or a little more. Such cases were 
handled individually by the Red Cross 
representative directly. There were 
many differences between the way 
white and colored cases were man- 
aged. For example, in order to ob- 
tain rations a colored owner was 
obliged to present a letter of recom- 
mendation from a white planter (any 
planter who was white was considered 
reputable), a condition which was not 
made in the case of whites.  Fre- 
quently colored people in very great 
need were unable to get attention un- 
til a white person could be found who 
would speak in their behalf.

An Instance of Waste 


BARGE-LOAD of sweet feed 

(oats and alfalfa ground and 
mixed with molasses) and meat, con- 
signed to Hollandale by the Red Cross 
was stopped at Murphy, the nearest 
landing: There was no means of con- 
veying it to Hollandale, and to release 
the barge the goods were dumped by 
the riverside. There was a very great 
need of these things at Murphy but 
they were watched and no one was al- 
lowed to take them. Before the wa- 
ter went down they had spoiled. 
Three thousand pounds of meat, and 
250 sacks of feed worth at least 
as much were allowed to spoil in a 
locality in serious need of them. Near 
Panther Burn a barge-load of hay was 
dumped over-board, because it was too 
difficult to get it to shore, although 
farmers in that vicinity have said they 
would have been glad to go after it 
in their own bateaux. It appears to 
be a fact that the Red Cross prefers 
to have goods wasted rather than set 
aside its red tape. 


The Panther Burn Plantation 


HIS plantation consists of 14,000 

acres and has several hundred Ne- 
gro tenant families. It is quite self- 
sustaining, and has a railroad station, 
store, commissary, blacksmith shop, 
church and school, three gins and seed 
houses. There are three plantation 


managers and a plantation doctor, 
There were, no houses lost on this 
place and the rehabilitation was done 
by the Red Cross entirely through the 
store manager. I was unable to talk 
with ‘any colored people on the place. 
An interesting feature of the place is 
the store, which is run entirely on a 
cash basis. Goods are furnished 
on credit only from the com- 
missary, an entirely separate 
building. Financially the ten- 
ants are even more at the mercy 
of the managers than usual, 
through a banking system car- 
ried on at the store. Such 
money as is paid to them instead 
of being given to them in cash 
is “banked” for them at the 
store. They can draw it out 
as needed, of course to spend in 
the store. The advantage of 
this system to the plantation 
owners is obvious. 
Gus Smith 

HIS man has a tubercular 

wife, a grown daughter 
with rheumatism, crippled so 
badly that she cannot walk and 
four children under five. He came 
from a plantation in Louisiana early 
in May and was in Camp _ Lov- 
isiana until it was evacuated in 
July, then was put on kitchen duty 
in the white camp, Hayes, both camps 
being in Vicksburg. His wife re- 
ceived treatment in Charity Hospital 
until the end of July then on the ad- 
vice of the doctor in charge she was 
sent to the Mississippi State ‘Tuber- 
culosis Sanitarium at Magee, Missis- 
sippi. She was kept there one day 
and returned to Vicksburg because she 
originally came from Louisiana and 
was not a Mississippi charge. She 
was too ill to walk when she arrived 
and had to be carried from the train 
to a car. The hospital would not re- 
ceive her so she was taken to the refu- 
gee camp. Meantime her husband 
had been told that as camp was clos- 
ing he would have to find a place for 
his family. He went to his home in 
Louisiana and found his house under 
water and his household goods entirely 
destroyed. He therefore returned to 
Vicksburg and found a three-room 
cabin which he could rent for very 
little. He had no money but the 
owner, a Negro, gave him free use of 
it until he could get work. He got a 
wagon and took his family to this 
place. The Red Cross gave him three 
army cots and six blankets, and three 
weeks’ rations, a concession, as it was

against their rules to give to refugees 
from outside of Warren County. 
Since then he has received no help be- 
cause he has not returned to the plant- 
ation he came from. His wife is at 
the point of death, his daughter is crip- 
pled, one of his children is very ill and 
they are destitute. 


George Brown, Gardener Plantation, 
Blanton 


HIS man is a cripple, one leg hav- 

ing been amputated. He was 
taken with the other refugees from 
his Plantation to Camp Louisiana at 
Vicksburg. When Camp was evacu- 
ated in July he and his wife returned 
but found their house surrounded by 
water and their household goods de- 
stroyed. Their loss was total. They 
stayed in their house receiving Red 
Cross rations distributed through the 
plantation store keeper until they both 
became very ill with malaria. They 
returned to Vicksburg on account of 
this and took refuge with colored 
friends there. Rehabilitation on that 
plantation was done through the 
owner and only to those tenants who 
remained on the place. George Brown 
has therefore received nothing and 
since his return has not even had ra- 
tions. 


Cary, Mississippi 
MSIE VAUGHN, refugee, is 


fifty-four years old. He is on the 
Tucker Dawson Plantation. He has 
a wife and one child. His planter 
would not let him leave until the wa- 
ter was in his house. He was afraid 
his labor would not come back unless 
forced to do so, and therefore sent for 
them long before the water had re- 
ceded. When they returned they had 
to stay in the colored church for sev- 
eral weeks. There was no work to 
be done and they had to live on Red 
Cross rations. These were distributed 
by the plantation store keeper and the 
Negroes believe that he gave them wa- 
ter spoiled goods from his stock and 
kept the Red Cross supplies. Emsie 
Vaughn and his wife lost everything 
they had except one bed. They were 
given a mattress and springs and two 
chairs. They have no way of know- 
ing whether the Red Cross intended 
to give them more or not. The goods 
are all kept in the store and disbursed 
by the store keeper. 

There is great dissatisfaction among 
the tenants around Cary and many of 
them are leaving. When they try to 
leave the place the planter holds their 
household goods, mules, wagons, live- 
stock, etc. Some planters lock their 
houses and send the tenants away 
empty-handed if they attempt to leave, 
as an example to the others. Debts 
owing before the high water are held

against them now. All their property 
can be held for debt. 

Relief supplies furnished by the Red 
Cross are being sold by a planter named 
Martin at Blanton. The hostler, who 
put the feed away, says it is now being 
sold to Negro land owners in the neigh- 
borhood. Shoes sent in for free dis- 
tribution are sold for $4.00 a pair. 

It is reported that at Greenville col- 
ored women were forced to work at 
cleaning the houses of white people 
after the flood and were only paid $1 
a week. Also that men in the same 
locality were forced to work, cleaning 
up debris, etc., and were whipped for 
refusing. These reports have not been 
substantiated. 


LOUISIANA 


N northern Louisiana, the cotton 

country, conditions are exactly sim- 
ilar to Mississippi. In the “sugar 
bowl” there is a marked improvement. 
I visited plantations around Baton 
Rouge and between there and New 
Orleans and found that, although 
many of the same abuses exist, the 
work has been fairly well done and 
the Red Cross seems to have exercised 
a close supervision. The labor situa- 
tion is very different and there was ap- 
parently no coercion in the matter of 
returning of refugees to plantations. 
The satisfactory work may be partly 
a result of the report of the colored 
committee to Mr. Hoover, which I 
have not seen. One immediate result 
of it was the appointment of Dr. J. S. 
Clark, President of Southern Univer- 
sity, at Scotland, as attaché to the State 
Reconstruction Office in the interest 
of colored people. Although a little 
ready to compromise, Dr. Clark has 
been on the whole insistent in his de- 
mands for the colored flood sufferers. 
It may be a significant fact that he is 
one of 15 Negroes in Baton Rouge 
who is allowed to vote. I heard him 
spoken of with a patronising respect by 
white people, who said he had the 





Bread-line 


‘ 


‘right kind” of influence with colored 
people. Nevertheless, in respect to the 
Red Cross and the flood sufferers, he 
has had the right kind of influence with 
white people. He asked for and re- 
ceived from Mr. Hoover a salaried 
staff of four colored investigators, ap- 
pointed by himself, to cooperate with 
Red Cross offices in the flood area of 
Louisiana. These investigators visited 
homes of colored flood sufferers and 
reported cases of need or any matters 
requiring special attention to the Red 
Cross workers and to Dr. Clark. With 
one exception they were met by an at- 
titude of hearty cooperation and fol- 
low-up visits paid to the same homes 
within a few days showed that they 
had received the relief needed. 

The exception was the Melville 
area. The worker in charge was Miss 
Cordelia Townsend, for many years a 
family case-worker for the New York 
Charity Organization Society. She 
indicated that colored workers were 
neither needed nor wanted in her area, 
and refused to cooperate with them in 
any way. ‘They went to her three 
times with various credentials from 
Mr. Hoover and National Headquar- 
ters, but met the same refusal. 


ELVILLE is situated on the 

Atchafalaya River. The water 
came in slowly from above the town 
and people were preparing to leave 
when a crevasse occurred suddenly on 
the opposite side and the water poured 
in with such swiftness that they were 
obliged to drop everything and run 
for their lives. No lives were lost 
but the property loss was almost total. 
The water, swirling in from two di- 
rections, first stirred the building about 
as if with a great spoon, then de- 
posited enormous quantities of sand so 
that when the flood had subsided the 
town was found to be almost com- 
pletely buried. The task of digging it 
out was so enormous that the Red

ON TO LOS ANGELES 


NE of the most significant pil- 
grimages undertaken by colored 
Americans and their friends across the 
American continent will converge on 
Los Angeles for the 19th Annual 
Spring Conference, June 27 to July 
3, of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People. 
This first great meeting of the N. 
A. A. C. P. on the Pacific Coast is 
significant for a number of reasons. 
In the first place, few people realize 
the growth in the colored population 
of the State of California. In Los 
Angeles alone there are 35,000 colored 
people and in the entire State of Cali- 
fornia, no less than 60,000. These 
colored people are kept in close con- 
tact through the well-organized 
branches of the N. A. A. C. P. and, 
as is shown in the now famous Ed- 
ward Glass extradition case, the col- 
ored people of the entire state of Cali- 
fornia can work effectively together 
at need. This they are doing in pre- 
paring for the N. A. A. C. P. Confer- 
ence, though of course the main bur- 
den of work and responsibility is 
borne by the Los Angeles Branch. 
How effectively this branch went 
to work was demonstrated at Indian- 
apolis last June, when the invitation 
to the N. A. A. C. P. to come to Los 
Angeles, issued by the Los Angeles 
Branch, was backed up by telegrams 
from the Governor of California and 
the Los Angeles Chamber of Com- 


merce. 


INCE then the branch has been 
making rapid strides. At the pres-

ent writing it is learned that the 
Mayor of Los Angeles is to appoint 
a special committee of prominent peo- 
ple to welcome the Conference, and 
that the Mayor himself is to serve 
on this committee ex officio. Some 
idea of the calibre of this Conference 
Committee may be gained from the 
list of names of those who have al- 
ready accepted membership on it. The 
names include: Hon. Arthur Eldridge, 
President of the Board of Public 
Works; Hon. James E. Davis, Chief 
of Police; Hon. Lewis H. Schwalbe, 
U. S. Collector of Customs; Judges 
Archibald and Guerin of the Superior 
Court and Judge Georgia Bullock of 
the Municipal Court; Bishops J. J. 
Cantwell, Bertram Stevens and J. W. 
Martin; Dr. Emory §. Bogardus of 
the University of Southern Califor- 
nia; Rabbi Edgar F. Manin, Super- 
visor J. H. Bean, Mrs. George H. 
Clark, member of the Board of Edu- 
cation; Dr. Walter Sylvester Her- 
zog, and numerous others prominent 
in the life of the city and the state. 

Quite aside from the importance of 
the meeting on the Pacific Coast and 
the new interest in race relations 
which this Conference will stimulate 
in the Far West, the journey there 
will give delegates and members of 
the N. A. A. C. P. unique opportunity 
to see large portions of the United 
States. The National Office after con- 
sultation with a number of railroad 
representatives, has chosen the Rock 
Island road, and officers of this rail- 
road are now working out itineraries 
by which, at minimum cost, delegates 
and visitors to the Los Angeles Con- 
ference may see as many as possible

of the points of interest in the West- 
ern states. 


T is probable that the National Of- 
_ fice party picking up delegations 
from Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Kansas City and other mid-western 
cities, will travel in a series of special 
cars. If the group is large enough the 
N. A. A. C. P. will be allotted a spe- 
cial train with a representative of the 
Rock island Railroad accompanying 
the party to see that all details of 
transportation are arranged smoothly, 

The National Office urges all 
branches planning to send delegates 
to the Los Angeles Conference, and 
all visitors planning to attend, to send 
in their names at the earliest possible 
moment to the National Office of the 
N. A. A. C. P., 69 Fifth Avenue, 
New York City, in order that ade- 
quate reservations may be made for 
all those planning to travel with this 
group. 


SOUTHERN WHITE EDITORS 


OUTHERN white editors are 

waking up to the work being done 
by the N. A. A.C. P. At all events 
they can no longer ignore it. An un- 
precedented response met the Associa- 
tion’s release reporting 21 lynchings 
for the year 1927. This, it will be 
recalled, was five more lynchings than 
were reported by Tuskegee, and in its 
release the N. A. A. C. P. gave its 
reasons for including mob murders 
not embraced in the Tuskegee report. 
A list of the Southern dailies com- 
menting editorially on the N. A. A. 
C. P. figures is impressive in itself.

[o date we have received clippings 
showing such editorial comment in 
the Montgomery, Alabama, Adver- 
tiser; the Columbus, Georgia, En- 
quirer-Sun; the Baltimore Evening 
Sun; the Columbia, South Carolina, 
Record; the Dallas, Texas, Journal; 
the Greensboro, North Carolina, Daily 
News; the Macon, Georgia, Tele- 
graph; and the Durham, North Caro- 
lina, Herald. This is exclusive of the 
editorial comment which was published 
in many Northern dailies. 


Some of the Southern editorial com- 
ment, as was to be expected, took an 
unfriendly tone. But some of it was 
surprisingly dispassionate and fair. 
For example, in the second of 
two editorials, the Greensboro Duily 
News comments on the fact that the 
N. A. A. C. P. in its lynching report 
charged the State of North Carolina 
with a lynching when it had been 
claimed that that state’s record was 
clear. Says the Greensboro Daily 
News: 

“|. the report establishes the fact 
that by this association the death of 
Tom Bradshaw in Nash County last 
August is called a lynching. Brad- 
shaw, it may be recalled, was charged 
with attempted criminal assault on a 
young girl. He fled and was hunted 
for days, to the accompaniment of 
great excitement. He was finally shot 
down in the chase and killed. The 
affair came only a few weeks after 
the killing of Broadus Miller by Com- 
modore Burleson in Burke County, 
with which it was in many respects 
similar. 

“The coroner’s jury which sat on 
Bradshaw’s death turned in a verdict 
to the effect that he ‘met his death 
(1) from the shotgun of some un- 
known person and (2) over-exertion 
and fatigue while trying to evade ar- 
rest’. That satisfied Nash County 
and most of the remainder of the 
state. 

“It was also in evidence—and, so 
far as known, not denied,—that Brad- 
shaw did not attempt to injure his 
pursuers, was unarmed and had on 
handcuffs during much of the man- 
hunt. He was shot while fleeing; but 
the name of the man who shot him is 
not known or has not been revealed. 

“The Daily News has no disposi- 
tion to argue the question of whether 
this was a lynching. It said at the 
time that the killing of Bradshaw was 
unwarranted. Obviously the pursuers 
were more interested in killing him 
than in capturing him. Morally it 
was so close to a lynching, as that 
term is generally used, that the differ- 
ence is inconsequential ; and technically 
it may very well be ranked as such. 
North Carolina has, as the Raleigh 
Times has pointed out, many acts

properly falling under the name which

UCH fair and candid comment 

from a white newspaper in the 
South is one of the most hopeful signs 
of progress in the approach toward 
decent and intelligent administration 
of race relations. It establishes that 
the N. A. A. C. P. motive in publish- 
ing its lynching figures is not to ma- 
lign the South but to rally the sen- 
timent of law-abiding citizens, North 
and South, against the evils of mob 
murder by an impartial and accurate 
recital of the facts. To have the N. 
A. A. C. P. interpretation of what 
constitutes a lynching supported by an 
outstanding journal of such repute as 
the Greensboro Daily News, is a source 
of encouragement and hope to the Na- 


tional Office.

HONOR ROLL BRANCHES 
HE sinews of N. A. A. C. P. 


activity as of other work by or- 
ganizations for the public good, are 
dollars. Those branches which pay 
their apportionment in full, help make 
possible the legal victories of which 
all colored citizens of the country are 
beneficiaries. It is a pleasure to be 
able to report that in the year 1927 
no less than 130 branches of the As- 
sociation paid their apportionments in 
full and that by far the greater num- 
ber of these branches exceeded their 
quotas. 

The honor roll branches, which 
paid their full apportionment, are as

SINEWS OF WAR 
ROBABLY there is no national 


organization doing work of the 
magnitude and importance of the 
N. A. A. C. P. on anything like so 
small a budget as the Association ex- 
pends. Partly this is made possible 
by the free gift of legal services by 
distinguished attorneys who would be 
entitled to charge many thousands of 
dollars.for what the Association re- 
ceives gratis. 

But there are certain inescapable 
charges which the Association must 
meet each year if its work is to go on 
and to-continue to be effective. It 
must have an office and pay rent on it. 
It must pay travelling expenses, tele- 
phone and telegraph charges. It must 
sometimes retain attorneys in distant 
cities who, as it is, usually make drastic 
reduction in their charges to the Asso- 
ciation. It must have an office staff 
and stenographers in order to deal 
with the routine of an organization 
covering 44 states; and to handle the 
enormous mail involved in keeping 
colored people throughout the United 
States in touch with each other, en- 
abling them to focus on matters of 
vital importance. Its officers must 
travel to Washington, throughout the 
South and West, encouraging colored 
people to organize, carrying the Asso- 
ciation’s message before white audi- 
ences, helping to create a favorable 
public opinion for the Negro in Amer- 
ica. Each year the officers of the As- 
sociation travel thousands of miles, 
spending their energy and ability for a 
remuneration that is relatively insig- 
nificant compared to the rewards of 
commercial life. 


HE smallness of the N. A. A. C. P. 
budget is a reflection upon colored 
people in America. Not that there 
are not many generous contributors, 
people who strain their resources to 
maintain a membership or make annual 
gifts. But too many people take no 
interest. They leave it to others, un- 
til suddenly, one day, misfortune falls. 
And these people, most often those 
who have not troubled to join the 
N. A. A. C. P. or to give one cent 
for its support, find themselves in des- 
perate need. Then they are glad in- 
deed that there is a National organi- 
zation, with distinguished lawyers 
ready to be called upon, able to spend 
money and furnish expert assistance 
in order that justice may be done the 
humblest colored man or woman. 
Your answer ought to take the,form 
of a remittance to the Treasurer ofthe 
Association, Mr. J. E. Spingarn, 69 
Fifth Avenue, New York City.

The 


HE Student Volunteer Movement 

is the recruiting agency among 

the Colleges and Universities of 
Canada and the United States for mis- 
sionaries to work under the auspices 
of the various Protestant Foreign 
Mission Church Boards in what is 
nominally called by them the work in 
non-Christian lands, meaning China, 
Africa, India, and the Pacific Islands. 
The Convention at Detroit, Mich., 
Dec. 28-Jan. 1, was an epoch-making 
one in many respects. The conven- 
tion was made up of about 3,500 
student delegates and about 1,000 
visitors, returned missionaries and 
persons especially interested. This to- 
tal of 4,000 persons was 2,000 less 
than a previous convention in Indian- 
apolis and 4,000 less than the one at 
Des Moines, Iowa, in 1920. No less 
than 25 nations and races were among 
the assembly. Of these more than 300 
were foreign students and about 100 





Student Volunteer 


Some of the Colored Delegates 


were American Negro College and 
University students. About one-third of 
the one hundred Negro students came 
along with white college delegations as 
members of the delegation. Such col- 
leges and Universities as: New York 
University, Barnard College, Univer- 
sity of Denver, University of Wiscon- 
sin, University of Chicago, North- 
western and others we cannot recall 
had Negroes among their delegations. 

The convention talked little about 
the need of sending missionaries. It 
talked more about quality. In fact it 
talked most about “cleaning house” 
here at home. The Committee on 
Arrangements for the Convention in- 
sisted early last October that the ho- 
tels of Detroit serve all delegates irre- 
spective of color. More than 24 of 
the leading hotels of Detroit signed an 
agreement to this end, which agree- 
ment was carried out in letter if not 
wholly in spirit during the convention. 


Movement 





Negroes and foreign students of 
other races shared every commit- 
tee and feature of the convention pro- 
gram from the choir to the booth 
exhibits. Among the principal Ne- 
gro platform speakers were: Dr. Mor- 
decai Johnson, Howard University; 
Max Yergan, Y. M. C. A. Secretary, 
South Africa; A. B. Dipeolu, Gold 
Coast, West Africa. 

The Convention was divided from 
day to day into more than 50 divisions 
for more intimate contacts and discus- 
sions of Convention themes and _prob- 
lems. These groups (colloquia as they 
were called) each had a_ leader. 
Among the 50 leaders of these groups, 
each of which was a minature of the 
convention especially in racial compo- 
sition, were 4 Negro leaders: Prof. A. 
Gregory, Talladega College; Prof. W. 
S. Nelson, Howard University; Miss 
Marian Cuthbert, Alabama; Mrs.

66" HE waking up month” would 

be an appropriate name for 
March. Not that there has really 
been any sleeping going on among 
the trees and bushes. They have 
looked dead and gray, but there were 
always tiny specks of buds on the dull- 
est of branches. ‘Here we are,” the 
enlarged buds seem to cry as they 
meet us boldly in March. I am not 
referring to those great white blooms 
that flash out on dogwood this month, 
nor the small pinkish flowers on the 
tedbud trees. 

I am thinking of threshold plants 
right in one’s yard, the old fashioned 
lilac bushes, for instance, that recall 
the time of picket fences. We had a 
white lilac bush on the south side of 
our yard. And on pleasant winter 
days the chickens would stand beside 
it to take their sun baths. They 
would get on the east side of the bush. 
All winter long green buds were to 
be found on this lilac. 


QUIET country bush and yet 

how poets have loved it! Walt 
Whitman wrote lilac poems as though 
his heart could never say enough for 
their homely graciousness. He spoke 
of their leaves as “heart-shaped”’. 
Thomas William Parsons sang ador- 
ingly of lilacs for his morning ramble, 
his weary noon hour, for vesper time, 
“At night when my friends are gone 
and I sit down to ponder on the day”. 
He compared their haunting perfume 
with the searching sounds of a flageo- 
let. Amy Lowell’s finest poem, Lilacs, 
presented them in their “false blue” 
with all but overpowering force of 
tenderness and sympathy. She made 
one love the lilac, that hearthside bush 
which shows its rich leaf in March. 

I have seen rabbits bound to our 
lilac bush from imaginary pursuers. I 
have discovered birds fluttering among 
the leaves in spring battle and watched 
cats lurking near the roots to fix a 
cruel stare on terrified birds. The 
lilac bush is a setting for out-of-door 
actors. And the white blooms when 
they arrived—weeks after the foliage 
—used to furnish spring bouquets for 
my teachers. These were necessary 
as peace offerings from one who drew 
and drew and drew and wrote fairy 
tales while other pupils were pouring 
over the huge geographies used in those 


days or busied with compound pro- 
portion.

I Dreamed About You in My

ALMONY flower, in your frock of 

fair white, 

I dreamed about you in my dreaming 
last night. 

I thought you’d come up from your 
place by the stream 

All dripping with dew— 

The bees after you— 

To make me a dream! 


I thought that the bees 
Had followed you up 
To dig them down deep 
In your pollen cup. 

One bee’d lost its wing, 
Another its sting. 


I blew them from you, 
And shook off the dew 
With one little puff, 

Yet that was enough! 
Down slope flew the bees 
Toward sycamore trees 
That grew on the stream— 
This all was a dream. 

O Balmony Flower 

In your frock of fair white, 
I dreamed about you 

In my dreaming last night! 


No, Ladybug 


O, Ladybug, you simply can’t 
Go strolling round the pitcher 
plant. 
I'd pluck them all, if I were able, 
And stick them on some witches table. 


They have a strange and evil habit, 
Each bug that comes, they’re sure to 
nab it. 

Each spider, too, they’ll always grab it, 
And make their awful bristles stab it, 
And this is fact, and not just fable. 
No, Ladybug, you simply can’t 

Go strolling round a pitcher plant.

Townsend, whose pretty little poem 
is seasonable for a March Little Page.

HAD some ice cream, 
And I gave it to my friends, 
But then the sun began to beam, 
And what was left of my ice cream? 


Dancing Snowflakes 


ANCING, whirling and prancing 
Through the skies of night 
Graceful, light 
As our little dark dancers dance, 
O’er great city and small town 
Kissing rosy cheeks and brown 
On and on you go 
To the rhythm the North Wind’s blow 
You go dancing, just dancing. 
Laughing and gay.

HERE are many lovely and inter- 
esting things in “The African 
Saga” translated from Cendrars’ L’An- 
thologie Negre by Margery Bianco 
(Payson and Clarke, $5.00). We 


quote two passages: 





Fire, fire, fire from the hearth below, 
fire from the hearth on high, 

Light that shines in the moon, light that 
shines in the sun, 

Star that gleams at night, star that 
cleaves the light, shooting star, 

Spirit of the thunder, shining eye of the 
storm, 

Fire of the sun that gives us light, 

I call thee for expiation, fire, O fire! 


Fire that passes, and all things die be- 
hind thy track, 

Fire that passes, and behind thee all 
things live, 

The trees are burned, ashes upon ashes, 

The grass grows, the plants bring forth 
fruit, é 

Fire, friend of man, I call upon thee, 
fire of expiation. 


Fire, protector of the hearth, I call upon 
thee! 

Thou passest and all are vanquished, 
none can overcome thee. 

Fire of the hearth, I call upon thee for 
expiation! 





“Scarcely had Nzame thrown Bingo 
over when Mboya rushed to his aid. 
Have you sometimes seen in the for- 
est, at night, a wandering flame which 
moves wavering here and there? Have 
you heard a woman’s voice which goes 
far off into the distance, calling, call- 
ing beneath the branches? Do not 
be afraid. It is Mboya seeking her 
child, Mboya who seeks but can never 
find him. A mother never gives up. 

“Bingo fallen, Mboya gone away, 
Nzame hastened in his turn. He 
wanted at all cost to find Bingo again. 


“On the sea he sought him. ‘Sea, 
sea, have you got Bingo?’ 
“On the earth, he sought him. 


‘Earth, earth, have you got Bingo?’ 

“And the earth and the sea an- 
swered: ‘No, no.’ 

“Impossible to find him. Otoyom, 
the great witch-doctor, had recognized 
Bingo’s noble birth and did not want 
to give him up; he had hidden him 
carefully away.” 





It is as Arthur B. Spingarn says in 
his introduction : 

“And so in this anthology we have 
not only a record of the wit and wis- 
dom of Africa but the soul of a peo- 
ple, which may be judged by the crit-

eria of pure letters. In this transla- 
tion, which has attempted throughout 
to capture the spirit of Cendrars’ book 
rather than to present an erudite ren- 
dition of original sources, English 
readers have their first opportunity to 
appraise Africa’s contribution to the 
literature of the world. I venture to 
believe that they will find it not un- 
worthy to stand beside American Ne- 
gro Spirituals and African Sculpture.” 

These stories and legends have been 
gathered from the 591 languages and 
dialects of Africa; of these Cendrars 
writes: 

“Appleyard, Krapf and Steere are 
unanimous in praising the beauty and 
the plastic power of these languages, 
and Wilson observes in particular that 
‘they are soft, supple, flexible to an 
almost limitless degree; their gram- 
matical principles are founded on a 
systematic and philosophic basis, and 
the number of their words can be aug- 
mented to infinity; they can express 
the most delicate shades of thought 
and sentiment, and there are perhaps 
no other languages in the world that 
have more definite character or greater 
precision in expression.’ ” 


ILLIAM . STANLEY 

BRAITHWAITE edits his 
fifteenth annual “Anthology of Maga- 
zine Verse” for 1927 (Brimmer Com- 
pany). 

These volumes, “from the slim book 
of eighty-seven pages in 1913, to the 
bulky tome of one thousand pages for 
the Sesqui-Centennial Edition for 
1926, and the present volume of nearly 
six hundred pages, cover an era in 
American poetry: perhaps, the great-

est era America has known in the his. ' 


tory of its poetry.” 

Among the colored poets who ap- 
pear in this last volume are: Lewis 
Alexander, Gwendolyn Bennett, Ster: 
ling A. Brown, Mae V. Cowdery, 
Countée Cullen, Langston Hughes, 
Georgia Douglas Johnson and Anne 
Spencer. 

The Editor says: 

“Another volume of especial inter- 
est is Countée Cullen’s anthology of 
Negro poets, ‘Carolling Dusk’. This 
work, while it contains selections from 
Dunbar, is chiefly a record of the 
amazing progress made during the past 
three or four years of the contribution 
by the poets of this race to the gen- 
eral body of American poetry.” 

No praise is too great for the com- 
piler of this work of love and erudi- 
tion. 


66D LACK AND WHITE”, an 

anthology of Washington verse 
has been edited by J. C. Byars, Jr. 
It is noteworthy because it represents 
four Negro and thirteen white authors. 
Georgia Douglas Johnson is there and 
Angelina Grimké; Lewis Alexander 
and Walter Everett Hawkins. It is 
a collection that has much worth read- 
ing. 

The Vanguard Press sends us six 
new volumes, all at the little price of 
50c. They include a symposium on 
Prosperity which reports the speeches 
and discussions of the League for In- 
dustrial Democracy, 1927. Dr. J. P. 
Warbasse has a little statement on Co- 
operation and its slow but sure con- 
quests throughout the world. C. L. 
Swartz writes on “Mutualism,” and 
attacks the monopoly of money, land, 
tariff and patents. A book by the late 
Louis F. Post on the Single Tax is 
included ; also one by B. Liber on the 
Child and the Home. M. H. Hedges 
writes an economic novel, “Dan Min- 
turn.” We can strongly recommend 
these books. 

Dr. H. N. Green of the National 
Medical Association has issued a vol- 
ume on “Pellegra” which ought to be 
of interest to medical men and others.

The Second Generation 


By ALLISON DAVIS 
Physician 
 hagre patients who loved you, 
And the hope work brought, 

Sustained you, 
When, worn out by late vigils 
With the sick, poor and black, 
You had to crawl 
On hands and knees 
To those who trusted you, 


Alone. 
Physician 
OU find real pleasure in your 
work— 
Taking liberties when you examine wo- 
men, 


And joking about it later. 


You prosper 
By prescribing dope to the slum Ne- 
groes 


For medicine, 
And taking their money with no serious 
effort to help them. 


When you have made your “pile”, 

You will move as far away from the 
Negro section 

As you can go. 


Minister 


you have something in you 

Which has made you feel the 
Church 

A bigger thing than yourself,— 

A Baptist church,— 

And which has made you go months 
without salary, 

So that the Church might be saved; 


Something 

Which has made your talk 

Like a friend’s silent confidence, 
And your face unlike other men’s, 
And made even your wife 

Respect you. 


Do you wish to call it “God”? 
I know you will speak it quietly. 


Minister 


You make your living 
By talking through a service 
About God, 
And rejoice equally 
0 get a marriage or 
A funeral. 


Have you convinced yourself yet 

That this whole business of a church 

And confident speaking to God, with you 
leading, 

Is not a madman’s game? 


And aren’t they fools to be paying you 
a salary 
To speak to God for them, 


March, 1928 


When your thoughts are always 
Of a pretty wife 
And a larger church? 


Lawyer 
You brought home your northern 


education 
To bleed the poor “niggers” you scorn, 
Threatening frantic blacks with jail, 
And pretending to save them from 
The Bugaboo of the Law. 
From one love-blind mother, 
You boast, 
You got all she had, 
Three hundred dollars, 
To keep her son out of jail. 


Well, 

Your new car 

Is all you have, 

And in that your white-skinned wife 
Loves her college boy; 


While the stupid, black mother 
You broke, 

Scrubs floors to keep 

Her son. 


College Girl 


you spent every week-end 

In all-night liquor parties with your 
“man”; 

You spent the money your mother 

Feared to borrow on her home, 

Not on beoks, but on dresses 

To make you the belle of fraternity 
dances. 


And you didn’t learn a damned thing 
Except the unnecessary tricks of loving, 
And ten animalistic dances. 


You will teach the Negro students far- 
ther south 
What you learned. 


Northern - College Girl 
HE chief thing 


You learned from your northern 
training 
Was how to be a sycophant with men, 
And excuse your parasitism 
By calling it love. 


Now you teach high school in the week, 

And wisely go to your “man” out of 
town 

For the week-ends. 


I pity you. 

I know how often you’ve wished 
You were dead, 

When you faced 

Your mother, 

After those week-ends. 


College Athlete 


you spend your winters 
Juggling basket-balls 
And women. 

You won’t work, 

You won't study, 

You won’t marry; 


But you have four “letters”, 
And a fraternity pin. 


College education 
Of a hundred like you every year 
Will bring the race along rapidly. 


Introspection 
By EDWARD SILVERA 


Whence have we come? 

We know but that 

God made man, 

And that Africa is a land of jungies-- 
We know too m 

That nights have been dark 

And like a million stars 

We have grinned 

Thru them all. 


It is strange 

That we should know Love, 

We who have gasped for breath 
Amid poisonous fumes of hate 
And have sucked 

The bitter breast of scorn; 

It is strange 

That we too 

Should know the joy 

Of kisses. 


Our mouths have sung 

The Lord’s song 

In a strange land, 

And our harp strings have vibrated 
With new tunes. 


We must find a new prayer 

To pray, 

The same words have grown dull 
To the ears of God: 

We must find a new prayer 

For the God of the sun 

And steel girders, 

We must build stronger altars 

To the God of skyscrapers. 


How quickly this dream has ended! 
Palm trees are waving 

On the banks of the Congo 
Where grass huts still hide dusky bodies 
From the sun; 

And there are voices 

Crying aloud in the wilderness— 
There are voices in the jungles 
That echo thru the night 

As ours did 

Long ago.

THE PASSING OF A FRIEND 


M. H. BARRETT, a Southern 

white man writes to the Au- 
gusta, Ga., Chronicle of the “beauti- 
ful life” of his colored servant. 


On December 8, 1927, Amelia Roberts, 
in the late seventies of her life and with 
her faculties unimpaired, passed to her 
Maker peacefully and without premoni- 
tion in the presence of her beloved 
daughter. For my family and myself I 
am moved to make this affectionate and 
just tribute. 

It has been my privilege to know her 
during my life, first as identified with 
the family of my father-in-law, Major 
George T. Barnes, and for more than 
thirty-three years as a mem’ tr of my 
immediate household. I hesitate for fear 
of seeming exaggeration to attempt to 
fully express our appreciation and grati- 
tude for the pleasure, comfort, and help, 
she has ever been to all of us. A de- 
voted friend she has ever been in gen- 
erous sympathy with our joys and sor- 
rows and there has never been any stint 
in her aid or affection. She loved the 
beautiful and especially—even caressing- 
ly—joyed in handling flowers and ever 
succeeded in adding a touch of beauty. 
As much as anyone I have ever known 
did she take unaffected delight in making 
others happy. To rich and poor, to 
white and colored, in health and more in 
sickness did she manifest such desire. It 
was the natural outpouring of her love 
to do good. Her refinement was ex- 
quisite. I never knew of her doing or 
sanctioning anything that would grate on 
the most sensitive. Genuineness, loyalty, 
kindliness, goodness made hers a beauti- 
ful life and us the better for knowing 
her. 


NEGRO SUFFRAGE 


HE Annual Meeting of the Ex- 

ecutive Committee of the Federal 
council of Churches was recently held 
in Cleveland and the ministers natur- 
ally began to talk about the 18th 
Amendment. Suddenly, up popped 
the shadow of the 14th and 15th 
Amendments and several colored men 
waxed eloquent on the subject. A 
resolution was finally drafted by the 
Business Committee of the meeting. 
It was a rather small knothole but 
the Commission crawled through and 
said: 

“The Question of enforcing the 18th 
Amendment has become an outstanding 
moral issue in America today and has 
raised the question of obedience to the 
fundamental law of our land, including 
all amendments to the Constitution. We, 


94 








therefore, go on record as endorsing the 
honest enforcement of the Constitution 
including all the amendments, and we 
ask the cooperation of all the com- 
munions of the Federal Council of 
Churches to that end.” 


INTER-RACIAL CHIVALRY 


ENRY B. HAZARD of Wash- 

ington, D. C., writes us of a 
few personal observations of racial 
contacts in Washington: 


Would you know the real hearts of 
folks? Then observe them in the daily 
walks of life, and their instinctive re- 
action to commonplace situations — in 
crowded street cars, for instance. 

A colored nurse girl, carrying a heavy 
white child, boards the car. A white 
lad offers her a seat. But possibly that 
was because of the white child, you may 
say. A white man, in his hurry to leave 
the car, forgets his valuable umbrella 
and leaves it in the seat. He is quickly 
followed to the platform by a colored 
girl who timidly touches his shoulder 
and courteously calls his attention to his 
property. On the way to work, a white 
woman is standing, with both white and 
colored men seated. It is a colored man 
who respectfully gives up his seat to 
her. And when we add to the list a 
badly wounded white World War vet- 
eran proceeding from a hospital, who 
insists on hanging to a strap that an 
aged colored woman may occupy his 
vacated seat, may we not well believe 
that hearts beat alike with the same 
human kindness, regardless of origin and 
exterior differences? The adjuration, 
“be ye kind one to another,” was directed 
to no one race, nor does any group have 
a monopoly on its observance. 

“Of a truth I perceive that God is 
no respecter of persons: .. . And hath 
made of one blood all nations of men 
for to dwell on all the face of the 
earth...” 


THE KLAN IN LITERATURE 
COLORED woman working in 


a cleaning establishment at De- 
troit, Michigan, found this piece of 
“literature” in one of the Klansmen’s 
pockets. We publish nine of the nine- 
teen stanzas: 


KU KLUX KLAN 


Oh Lord, we noble K. K. K.’s 

Come now beseeching Thee, 

Give us the Kingdom and the power, 
And grant to us this Plea. 


Oh Lord, do keep the negro down 
Let devilishness his path grown, 
The Jew and Catholic turn around 
Send down on them thy frown. 


a 


BS 


Thou knowest Lord we should be first, 
Wilt thou not order thus 

Lo let their wishes over us, 

Will surely bring a curse. 


They are growing too intelligent, 
And too anxious to make a race, 
Here on this white man’s government, 
Right in the white man’s face. 


We have tried our best both day and 
night, 

To force them to the wall, 

Made wages less and clipped their 
rights, 

But they rise with this and all. 


But we are in this fight to win, 

The battle now is on, 

We will wade through blood up to our 
chin, 

To keep the negro down. 


But oh, Lord, we have kindly built, 

To our purpose we are true, 

We want the length and breadth of 
earth 

Just for our chosen few. 


Break down the Catholic and the Jew 
Cast out the sons of Ham 


- And we will spread the joyful news, 


Hosanna to the Lamb. 


If Thou Oh Lord, will hear our prayer 
And answer it alright, 

We will thank Thee ’til the day 

We are where, 

There will be no negroes to fight. 


LOUISIANA SCHOOLS 
COMMITTEE from the Par- 


ents group of one of the colored 
schools of New Orleans sets forth the 
following facts: 


1. There are 1,157 pupils enrolled 
in the Valena C. Jones School. 

To house these pupils, one main 
building, consisting of 12 poorly venti- 
lated and equipped classrooms, an annex 
with 7 classrooms and 2_ industrial 
rooms, and a bungalow with 4 rooms 
are used. Thhe total seating capacity 
of the school is 827. 

3. There are 18 drinking fountains 
and 24 toilets. 

4. In the main school yard, all drink- 
ing fountains are exposed to the weather. 
The toilets are out from the main build- 
ing and annex. In rainy and cold 
weather children are compelled to cross 
the yard to attend their needs. The 
yard is a veritable lake in rainy weather. 

5. The hall in the annex is cold. There 
is no method of heating it. After each 
rainy and cold spell this winter chil- 
dren have remained out of school for 
personal illness, and one third of teach- 
ers are always ill.

6. Eight classes of first grade pupils 
have a school day of 2% hours. 

7, The sizes of these classes vary 
from 37 to 51 pupils. 

8. Twenty-six teachers and one prin- 
cipal constitute the faculty. 

9, Four classrooms and four teachers 
are used to teach 352 pupils in first 
grade. 

10. The 1927 school census shows 
there are 5,152 colored children of 
school age in the 7th Ward. 

11. This is a rapidly developing sec- 
tion of the City. It is a community 
largely composed of colored tax payers 
and_ renters. 

For these reasons, the parents of the 
Valena C. Jones School are asking for a 
36-room modern brick building contain- 
ing 32 class-rooms, four rooms for house- 
keeping: a kitchen, bed room, dining 
room, pupils’ lunch room; a_ sewing 
room, manual training room, a room 
for health work, a basement and assem- 
bly room. 


NOTES FROM THE SOUTH 


E clip the following notes from 
letters and papers. The italics 
are ours: 

B. J. Doty, deserted from the 
French Foreign Legion and was con- 
demned to death. The American Le- 
gion secured his release. Mr. Doty 
remarks, in the Baltimore Sun: 

“T want to get back to Mississippi and 
raise cotton,” he explained. “There’re 
plenty of black folk to kick around. It’s 
not necessary to travel to get excite- 
ment.” Doty is from Biloxi. 


HE Valdosta, Ga., Daily Times 
has this account of an automobile 
accident : 

Details of the accident are rather 
scarce, but they state that the child was 
endeavoring to cross the street near the 
house, while the Negro was driving in 
from Quitman. Another car, also go- 
ing west, struck the child, who darted in 
front of Corbett’s vehicle. He turned 
the car as rapidly as possible toward the 
ditch and threw on brakes, but the child 
was nevertheless struck just as she and 
the car alike reached the di¢ch. 

Corbett jumped from the car and ran 
to the child. He remained at the place 
until the officers arrived, when he was 
taken into custody. 

Subsequently a warrant charging 
murder was sworn out for him, and 
he was transferred to the county jail. 

Corbett, who has a very good repu- 
tation and has been employed for many 
years by a local firm, insisted that the 
tragedy was entirely unavoidable. 


The Charlotte, N. C. Observer re- 
cords the antics of students of the Uni- 
versity of N. C. with freak Ford cars: 


Two other interesting Ford stories 
were unearthed here recently while in 
conversation with Alec Mendenhall, 
banjo picker for the Carolina Buccaneer 
orchestra, which was stationed at the 
Atlantic hotel in Morehead City during 


the summer. 


March, 1928 


The musicians returned to the coast 
aboard their purchases and proceeded to 
decorate them during their spare time. 
Mendenhall painted his roadster blue 
and put 87 three-inch white circles about 
the body and fenders. . . . 

The other car is decorated in an 
equally colorful manner. It is in the 
university colors, blue and white. One 
side is white with blue doors and the 
other side is blue with white doors, with 
the fenders in blue and white as required 
by the color scheme. 4 natural skull 
adorns the radiator cap. It is that of a 
Negro who was lynched at Ocean City 
a year or so ago. 


HE Jackson, Miss., Daily Clarion- 
Ledger says of two porters in a 
local hotel: 


Jackson police late Wednesday night 
arrested two Negro men, Major Pin- 
kerson and George Lewis, and two white 
women, in a room of a local hotel, their 
conduct being Such as to cause a charge 
of disorderly conduct being placed 
against the women, who were placed in 
jail here, while the Negroes were car- 
ried to Raymond for safe keeping. 


A private letter adds these details: 


“Lewis and Pinkerson are both re- 
ported to be in precarious conditions. It 
is said the charges had been dismissed 
in police court when the deputy was 
bringing them back from Raymond to 
Jackson. The boys say the sheriff of- 
fered no resistance whatever and that 
when they saw the mob they, the boys, 
jerked loose but the sheriff (that is the 
deputy sheriff) grabbed them and 
turned them over to the mob. 

“They were sent from here yesterda) 
to Raymond, Miss., this county for al- 
leged safe keeping. Today at 12 o’clock 
noon when being brought back to Jack- 
son they were taken from the sheriff by 
a mob and castrated, their ears cut off 
and they were laid on their backs and 
heavy men stood on the two boys’ ab- 
domens and jumped up and down on 
them and thereby ruptured them. 

This is the fourth case in which Ne- 
gro boys have been castrated here within 
the past year charged only with mutual 
intercourse with white women.” 


FROM AFRICA 


IR GORDON GUGGISBERG, 
former Governor of the Gold 
Coast, has been making speeches in 
America concerning the Africans. 
Africa has heard and this is one reply 


from the Gold Coast Independent: 


In telling his audience that the natives 
of the Gold Coast do not want to mix 
with the white people, and that a chief 
in the Gold Coast is elected by the people 
and if he is not a good chief and com- 
mits many offences he can be deposed 
and another elected in his place, Sir Gor- 
don appears to us to have adopted the 
principle of telling half the truth. For 
in truth, we should have expected him 
to be very frank in telling his American 
audientes of the Provincial Council of 


Chiefs and The Native Administration 
Ordinance, all of his making, which 
materially tend to render the people 
powerless in deposing any Chief who 
does not conform to the traditions and 
constitutional oath of his Stool. For 
by the aid of these nefarious measures 
Government seeks to augment the pow- 
ers of its favoured and misguided Chiefs 
so as to defy, set at nought and even 
over-ride the authority of the Oman 
(The State Council in the several 
States) from whom, according to native 
customary laws, these Chiefs derive 
their powers and whose is the unques- 
tionable last word in deciding upon the 
enstoolment or destoolment of any de- 
linquent Chief. The picture presented 
by Sir Gordon to his hearers, provided 
he is correctly reported, of the alleged 
disinclination of the blacks to mix with 
the whites is distorted and misleading. 
The natives of this country have always 
exhibited a sincere good-will and esprit 
de corps for their white friends—official 
and mercantile—and this is always so, 
notwithstanding the grievous fact, that 
our white officials in their zealous devo- 
tion to and ardent worship of the bogey 
of organised bureaucracy, have always 
kept their promises to the Natives with 
Punic faith. Segregation is the policy 
and belief of these officials and there 
is nothing which widens more the gulf 
of race prejudice than segregation, which 
we cannot help confessing has always 
been encouraged by our Administrators 
—Sir Gordon as well, none so the more. 
We demur with considerable misgivings 
the veracity of the assertion of Sir Gor- 
don that the people of the Gold Coast 
are suspicious of the American Negro, 
fearing an attempt on his part to take 
advantage of them. As this unfounded 
statement may likely tend to engender 
ill-feeling in our brethren in America 
‘ainst us, we make haste to repudiate 
it. On the contrary, we aver in all 
conscientiousness that we have always 
bewailed the fact that we are not suf- 
ficiently in touch with our brethren on 
the other side and fervently pray that 
we may come at no distant date to know 
each other as we should, believing that 
by that means the emancipation of our 
people from economic serfdom will be 
considerably enhanced. Our brethren in 
America may well rest assured that they 
enjoy our fullest confidence and we 
watch their affairs with great interest 
whilst wishing them greater successes in 
all the big things they have been achiev- 
ing which tend daily to infuse in us in- 
spiration more and more to pursue our 
course in the general run for progress. 


@ A singular political tangle has 
arisen on the Gold Coast, British West 
Africa. In giving the people the right 
to minority representation in the Gov- 
ernor’s Council, the English tried to 
institute a council of Paramount Chiefs 
with certain law making powers. As 
the chiefs are elected by the people, 
the people resent this attempt which 
practically elects their chiefs for them. 


They are refusing to let the chiefs sit 
in the Council.

THE CHARLES WADDELL 
CHESNUTT HONORARIUM, 
1927 


HE CRISIS has the honor to an- 
nounce the distribution of the 
Charles Waddell Chesnutt Honoraria 
for the best three contributions to THE 
Crisis during the year 1927, as fol- 
lows: 


To Mrs. Effie Lee Newsome, $200 
for the “Little Page” contributed to 
ten numbers of THE CRrISsIs. 


To W. E. Matney, $100 for 
“Teaching Business’, an essay con- 
tributed to the July number. 

To Zona Gale, $50, for “Medals”, 
a poem contributed to the September 
number. 


The donors of the Fund for these 
prizes included: Mrs. E. R. Alexan- 
der, John E. Nail, Jr., James Weldon 
Johnson, George W. Crawford, W. 
E. B. Du Bois, and Tue Crisis maga- 
zine. 

The decision as to the prize win- 
ners was made by the Editors of THE 
Crisis with the advice of readers who 
have written us. 


AUGUSTUS G. DILL 


T is with deep regret that THE 
Crisis announces the withdrawal 
with this issue of Mr. Augustus G. 
Dill as Business Manager. For nearly 
fifteen years Mr. Dill has given us 
loyal and efficient service. He was by 
nature and training the sensitive artist 
and musician rather than the business 
man and it was with hesitation that 
I asked him to leave his chosen voca- 
tion of teaching at Atlanta Univer- 
sity and throw in his lot with a cause 
of precarious prospects. He came to 
THE Crisis at a sacrifice and the mul- 
titudinous and often petty details of a 
business office in a cold and selfish city 
made hard demands upon his time and 
strength. He stuck to his job and 
saw its success and growth. He leaves 
it today with the good wishes of all 
his fellow workers who will always 


remain his sympathetic and admiring 
friends.

MEP 


THE NAME “NEGRO” 
South Bend, Ind. 
EAR SIR: 

I am only a high school student 
in my Sophomore year, and have not the 
understanding of you college educated 
men. It seems to me that since THE 
Crisis is the Official Organ of the Na- 
tional Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People which stand for equal- 
ity for all Americans, why would it 
designate, and segregate us as “Ne- 
groes’, and not as “Americans”. 

The most piercing thing that hurts 
me in this February Crisis, which forced 
me to write, was the notice that called 
the natives of Africa, “Negroes”, in- 
stead of calling them “Africans”, or 
“natives”. 

The word, “Negro”, or “nigger”, is 
a white man’s word to make us feel in- 
ferior. I hope to be a worker for my 
race, that is why I wrote this letter. | 
hope that by the time I become a man, 
that this word, “Negro”, will be abol- 
ished. 


Rotanp A. Barton. 
Y dear Roland: 


Do not at the outset of your 
career make the all too common error 
of mistaking names for things. Names 
are only conventional signs for iden- 
tifying things. Things are the reality 
that counts. If a thing is despised, 
either because of ignorance or because 
it is despicable, you will not alter mat- 
ters by changing its name. If men 
despise Negroes, they will not despise 
them less if Negroes are called ‘‘col- 
ored” or “Afro-Americans”. 

Moreover, you cannot change the 
name of a thing at will. Names are 
not merely matters of thought and 
reason; they are growths and habits. 
As long as the majority of men mean 
black or brown folk when they say 
“Negro”, so long will Negro be the 
name of folks brown and black. And 
neither anger nor wailing nor tears 
can or will change the name until the 
name-habit changes. 

But why seek to change the name? 
“Negro” is a fine word. Etymologic- 
ally and phonetically it is much better 
and more logical than “African” or 
“colored” or any of the various hy- 
phenated circumlocutions. Of course, 
it is not “historically” accurate. No 
name ever was historically accurate: 


Du. Pore 


neither “English,” “French,” ‘Ger- 
man,” “White,” “Jew,” “Nordic” nor 
“Anglo-Saxon.” They were all at 
first nicknames, misnomers, accidents, 
grown. eventually to conventional 
habits and achieving accuracy because, 
and simply because, wide and continued 
usage rendered them accurate. In this 
sense “Negro” is quite as accurate, 
quite as old and quite as definite as 
any name of any great group of people. 

Suppose now we could change the 
name. Suppose we arose tomorrow 
morning and lo! instead of being “Ne- 
groes’’, all the world called us ‘“Cheiro- 
polidi’,—do you really think this 
would make a vast and momentous 
difference to you and to me? Would 
the Negro problem be suddenly and 
eternally settled? Would you be any 
less ashamed of being descended from 
a black man, or would your school- 
mates feel any less superior to you? 
The feeling of inferiority is in you, 
not in any name. The name merely 
evokes what is already there. Exorcise 
the hateful complex and no name can 
ever make vou hang your head. 

Or, on the other hand, suppose that 
we slip out of the whole thing by call- 
ing ourselves “Americans”. But in 
that case, what word shall we use when 
we want to talk about those descen- 
dants of dark slaves who are largely 
excluded still from full American citi- 
zenship and from complete social privi- 
lege with white folk? Here is Some- 
thing that. we want to talk about; 
that we do talk about; that we Ne- 
groes could not live without talking 
about. In that case, we need a name 
for it, do we not? In order to talk 
logically and easily and be understood. 
If you do not believe in the necessity 
of such a name, watch the antics of a 
colored newspaper which has deter- 
mined in a fit of New Year’s Resolu- 
tions not to use the word “Negro!” 

And then too, without the word 
that means Us, where are all those 
spiritual ideals, those inner bonds, 
those group ideals and forward striv- 
ings of this mighty army of 12 mil- 
lions? Shall we abolish these with 
the abolition of a name? Do we want 
to abolish them? Of course we do 
not. They are our most precious 
heritage.

Historically, of course, your dislike 
of the word Negro is easily explained: 
“Negroes” among your grandfathers 
meant black folk; “Colored” people 
were mulattoes. The mulattoes hated 
and despised the blacks and were in- 
sulted if called “Negroes”. But we 
are not insulted—not you and I. We 
are quite as proud of our black an- 
cestors as of our white. And perhaps 
a little prouder. What hurts us is 
the mere memory that any man of Ne- 
gro descent was ever so cowardly as 
to despise any part of his own blood. 

Your real work, my dear young 
man, does not lie with names. It is 
not a matter of changing them, losing 
them, or forgetting them. Names are 
nothing but little guideposts along the 
Way. The Way would be there and 
just as hard and just as long if there 
were no guideposts,—but not quite as 
easily followed! Your real work as 
a Negro lies in two directions: First, 
to let the world know what there is 
fine and genuine about the Negro race. 
And secondly, to see that there is noth- 
ing about that race which is worth con- 
tempt; your contempt, my contempt; 
or the contempt of the wide, wide 
world. 


Get this then, Roland, and get it 
straight even if it pierces your soul: a 
Negro by any other name would be 
just as black and just as white; just 
as ashamed of himself and just as 
shamed by others, as today. It is not 
the name—it’s the Thing that counts. 
Come on, Kid, let’s go get the Thing! 

W. E. B. Du Bors. 


ROBERT E. LEE 

ACH year on the 19th of Janu- 

ary there is renewed effort to 
canonize Robert E. Lee, the great con- 
federate general. His personal come- 
liness, his aristocratic birth and _ his 
military prowess all call for the verdict 
of greatness and genius. But one 
thing —one terrible fact — militates 
against this and that is the inescapable 
truth that Robert E. Lee led a bloody 
war to perpetuate human slavery. 
Copperheads like the New York Times 
may magisterially declare: “‘of course, 
he never fought for slavery”. Well, 
for what did he fight? State rights? 
Nonsense. The South cared only for 
State Rights as a weapon to defend 
slavery. If nationalism had been a 
stronger defense of the slave system 
than particularism, the South would 
have been as nationalist in 1861 as it 
had been in 1812. 

No. People do not go to war for 
abstract theories of government. They 
fight for property and privilege and 
that was what Virginia fought for in 


the Civil War. And Lee followed 
March, 1928 


Virginia. He followed Virginia- not 
because he particularly loved slavery 
(although he certainly did not hate 
it), but because he did not have the 
moral courage to stand against his 
family and his clan. Lee hesitated and 
hung his head in shame because he was 
asked to lead armies against human 
progress and Christian decency and did 
not dare refuse. He surrendered not 
to Grant, but to Negro Emancipation. 

Today we can best perpetuate his 
memory and his nobler traits, not by 
falsifying his moral débacle, but by ex- 
plaining it to the young white South. 
What Lee did in 1861, other Lees are 
doing in 1928. They lack the moral 
courage to stand up for justice to the 
Negro because of the overwhelming 
public opinion of their social environ- 
ment. ‘Their fathers in the past have 
condoned lynching and mob violence, 
just as today they acquiesce in the dis- 
franchisement of educated and worthy 
black citizens, provide wretchedly in- 
adequate public schools for Negro 
children and endorse a public treat- 
ment of sickness, poverty and crime 
which disgraces civilization. 

It is the punishment of the South 
that its Robert Lees and Jefferson 
Davises will always be tall, handsome 
and well-born. That their courage 
will be physical and not moral. That 
their leadership will be weak compli- 
ance with public opinion and never 
costly and unswerving revolt for jus- 
tice and right. It is ridiculous to seek 
to excuse Robert Lee as the most for- 
midable agency this nation ever raised 
to make 4 million human beings goods 
instead of men. Either he knew what 
slavery meant when he helped maim 
and murder thousands in its defense, 
or he did not. If he did not he was a 
fool. If he did, Robert Lee was a 
traitor and a rebel—not indeed to his 
country, but to humanity and human- 


ity’s God. 


PREJUDICE 
REJUDICE against Negroes is in- 
stinctive in the young; but this 
is the way that Burch and Patterson’s 
“American Social Problems”, (Mac- 
millan, 1922), helps the young white 
idea along: 


Chapter 11, “The American Race 
Problem”’: 


“The natural selection of a tropical 
environment, operating for thousands of 
years, has produced in the Negro quali- 
ties which cannot be overcome by a few 
centuries of civilization.” 

“The gallant sea rovers who sailed 
the Spanish Main were merchantmen 
or pirates, slavers or men-of-war, as 
the occasion demanded.” 

“Most of the slaves accepted their 
fate stoically, for their moral ideals were 
low and their conceptions of family life 
undeveloped.” 


“We have seen the effects of a tropi- 
cal environment upon the racial heredity 
of the Negro. Some of these slavery 
accentuated as, for example, irrespon- 
sibility and an undeveloped moral sense. 
Under these circumstances may we ex- 
pect the family ideals of the Negro to 
compare favorably with our own?” 

“Prohibition has established itself in 
the South to make Negro labor more 
eficient and to diminish crime. The 
Negro’s ignorance and superstition are 
proverbial, while his uncleanliness ex- 
acts a terrible toll.” 

“The Negro represents a nature peo- 
ple, unmoral rather than immoral.” 

“That the Negro is not adapted to the 
environment of the Northern states is 
shown by the fact that his race would 
die in the North were it not recruited 
by fresh migrations from the South.” 

“A similar sad fate has awaited them 
here, for the Negro does not seem 
adapted to city life.” 

“Colored legislators sat in the proud 
halls of Southern capitals, while illiterate 
ex-slaves wasted the public funds in a 
wave of corrupt and foolish extrava- 
gance.” 

“The laws of many states forbid the 
inter-marriage of Negroes and whites. 
This is regarded by intelligent men of 
both races as a wise prohibition.” 

“Born and surrounded by a bad social 
environment, his tendency toward crime 
is natural. The ambitious and forward 
mulatto is often regarded with suspi- 
cion by both races, to neither of which 
is he able to adjust himself. On the 
other hand, this mixed group has pro- 
duced many of the great leaders of the 
colored race.” 

“In some places a system closely re- 
sembling peonage has been uncovered. 
The planter, however, often finds it dif- 
ficult to secure Negroes for steady 
work.” 

“In his present stage of economic de- 
velopment, it is difficult to see how the 
Negro could properly support himself. 
He might even lapse into a state of bar- 
barism.” 


FORTY AND EIGHT 


Mr. Charles P. Flynn 

C. de G. Society 40 and 8 

Dear Mr. Flynn: 

I AM with much regret tendering 
my resignation to the Society of 

40 and 8 because of the refusal of the 

national organization to remove the 

discrimination against color. 

During the war I commanded three 
regiments of Negro combat troops and 
served with them in battle. Their 
quality as soldiers was very high and 
in their devotion to duty and patriotism 
they measured up to the best standard 
of American citizenship. To deny these 
men admission to a Society based upon 
membership in the American Legion 
and upon their war service is a gross 
injustice. 

When initiated into the 40 and 8 
I did not know of this discrimination. 
I have not resigned before because of

the assurances of the Massachusetts 
officers that it would be removed from 
the National Constitution. You have 
done everything possible without suc- 
cess. I do not mean my action to im- 
ply criticism upon the Massachusetts 
society but in justice to the men who 
served with me, I cannot longer defer 
action. 
Joun H. SHERBURNE. 
Note: The Massachusetts Society 
of the 40 and § has unanimously gone 
on record demanding the change of the 
Constitution and has taken the color 
discrimination out of its own Consti- 
tution.

BLACK AND WHITE 
WORKERS 


HE struggle for the liberation of 

the working classes in general 
and of the Negro race in America in 
particular is, of course, at bottom the 
same struggle. But great difficulty 
faces both the workers because the es- 
sential identity of the problem is not 
recognized either by white working- 
men or black. Black workingmen are 
the heirs of every effort. which the 
white working masses have made to- 
ward freedom: the bestowal of uni- 
versal suffrage; the shortening of the 
hours of labor; the protection of wo- 
men and children in industr,;; the rec- 
ognition of the right to collective bar- 
gaining; and all the rest of the vic- 
tories more or less completely won by 
the working class movement. Through 
these victories Negroes were emanci- 
pated from slavery in America; par- 
tially enfranchised; and given at least 
a fighting chance for a living wage. 
On the other hand, all this story has 
not been told Negroes and they are not 
born knowing all about it. The work- 
ing class movement has seldom at- 
tempted any intelligent propaganda to 
let them know of the past struggle; the 
Negro home does not know it; and the 
Negro school does not teach it. And 
to make the matter worse, both white 
and black workingmen have come un- 
der the sinister influence of the white 
employer. 

The white workingman has swal- 
lowed the white employer’s race preju- 
dice, lock, stock and barrel; so that he 
doesn’t want to work beside Negroes; 
he doesn’t want to live in their neigh- 
borhood; he doesn’t want to vote for 
them or with them; he doesn’t want 
to share the same parks, movies, street 
cars and railway trains; and he doesn’t 
want anybody to think that he is as 
low as a Negro. 

The black workingman has taken 
from the white employer a different 
set of beliefs, but equally composed of 
prejudices and assumptions. If he 
hunts a job, he is told that the white 


98 


employer is willing to employ him but 
that the white workingmen will not 
work with him and that his only 
chance to work is to “scab”. And the 
difficulty is that this is largely true. 
He finds the white workingmen vot- 
ing against his schools and civil rights 
and excluding him from his trade 
unions; and the white employer is not 
at all loath to let the Negro know 
these facts in detail. 

In addition to this and on the posi- 
tive side, through the white employer 
and capitalist the Negro receives many 
of the things which the City and State 
backed by the white workers’ vote re- 
fuse to give him: all of the Negro 
colleges; most of his secondary and 
high schools; a large part of the bet- 
ter school buildings have been the gift 
to him from white philanthropists and 
they stand as a tremendous bribe to 
make Negroes hate white fellow work- 
ers and look upon them as his ene- 
mies. 

All this would be important if it 
affected only the United States where 
the Negro forms perhaps one-ninth of 
the working class. But with local dif- 
ferences all this is essentially true of 
the colored workers throughout the 
world and a majority of the world’s 
workers today are colored. White 
workers are today as yesterday voting 
armies and navies to keep. China, In- 
dia, Mexico and Central America in 
subjection and being paid high wages 
to do this while “niggers” and 
“dagoes” and “chinks” starve, slave and 
die. 

What chance is there then for the 
real liberation of any working class 
until the white and colored workers 
who now compete for each other’s 
bread understand each other and 
know the history of the labor move- 
ment? And what better medium is 
there for understanding than periodi- 
cals, monthly, weekly and daily, 
widely disseminated, which tell the 
truth to both groups? 


THE FAILURE TO VOTE 
OHN HAYS HAMMOND of the 


National Civic Federation admitted 
failure in his “get-out-the-vote” cam- 
paign of November, 1926. Twenty- 
four states fell behind the voting rec- 
ord of 1922 and forty-one fell far be- 
hind the record of 1924; and this hap- 
pened despite a non-partisan movement 
backed by the largest and most power- 
ful general organizations in the land. 
Twenty-one millions voted in 1922, 
thirty millions in 1924 and less than 
twenty-two millions in 1926. The 
eligible vote in 1926 was sixty-two mil- 
lions. Only one citizen in three 
thought voting worth while. Ameri- 
cans think baseball is worth while; they 





think prize fighting is important ; they 
think divorce trials and crime head. 
lines news; but for fifty years, since 
the Negro was enfranchised, he and 
the American world have been taught 
that voting is a failure and democracy 
unequal to the task of efficient govern- 
ment. American after American, of 
wide power and influence, comes home 
from abroad lauding autocracy; a per- 
sistent campaign against state owner- 
ship and control of industry has had 
astonishing success; popular primary 
elections—once a triumph of democ- 
racy—are being laughed and shamed 
out of court. 

And what does all this failure and 
reaction prove? It proves simply that 
democracy cannot function without in- 
telligent voters who stand with the 
Negro in regarding the right to vote 
as the one great weapon and _ prero- 
gative of free manhood. 


HERNDON 


HE Crisis brings me the news of 

the death of Alonzo F. Herndon 
ef Atianta, Ga., whom I had known 
and whose friendship I have cl.erished 
since back in the 90’s when ! was 
teaching at Storr’s School and Mr. 
Herndon was Treasurer of the First 
Congregational Church. His mother, 
a beautiful, lovable woman, was a good 
friend of mine, in whose home I often 
was. 

I want to thank you for the kindly 
words of warm appreciation of my 
friend, who though born of a mother 
in whose gentle being flowed darker 
blood, yet he was as white in heart 
as any hero of any age. It seems to 
me the picture is an injustice but I 
have not seen him in years. I have 
several fine photos of him of years 
ago. Yes Dr. Du Bois, the “deviltry 
of color prejudice” did its evil work 
with him in more ways than you can 
realize. 

Some years after I was away from 
the South, we met in Boston, the first 
time he was ever out of Georgia. For 
one glad week he was escorted to most 
things worth seeing in Boston—from 
the State House, Library, Music Hall, 
worshipping in Phillips Brooks Church, 
staying at a good hotel and never in 
that time was the question of color 
once presented for he was everywhere 
supposed to be white, even by my 
friends whom he met. He might 
have left the South and all it meant 
and passed for a white man, but he 
was too staunch and loyal to do so. 
In spite of his lack of education there 
was a strong sense of just understand- 
ing, putting things together in his own 
wise way. He certainly was a fine 


character.

The Flood, the Red Cross, etc, 


(Continued from page 81) 
Cross proposed instead to rebuild the 
whole town. The citizens protested 
against this and requested them jp- 
stead to excavate and restore the dam- 
aged buildings. This plan was adopted 
and when I visited Melville in Oc. 
tober the streets were cleared and the 
principal buildings dug out and re. 
paired. 

Klotzville, as the colored section of 
town is called, is a dreary collection 
of little frame houses set negligently 
below the main part of the town. The 
water lifted them from the foundation 
blocks, whirled them around, and left 
them lying tipsily where they hap- 
pened to be. Some were totally 
wrecked, and some apparently simply 
disappeared. The banks of a: creek 
just outside the town were strewn with 
the timbers and the splintered frag- 
ments of household goods. Almost no 
rebuilding had been done in Klotz- 
ville, although some of the houses had 
been put back on the blocks, I talked 
with , who told me 
that it was believed that the white 
people were maneuvering to get the 
entire appropriation for the ‘town 
spent on white property. 

Upon returning from the refugee 
camp at Baton Rouge most of the col- 
ored refugees camped in Red Cross 
tents along the levee. As rapidly as 
possible they were sent back to live 
in such houses as were in any way 
habitable. When I was there only four 
families were left in tents and _ they 
had been told that the tents would be 
collected in a few days. The week be- 
fore 20 colored families had _ been 
turned out of the tents. They had 
no houses to go to and took refuge 
with friends and relatives as_ they 
could. Some found shelter under the 
piled-up wreckage of houses along the 
creek. The Red Cross worker ex- 
plained that the people had been given 
a week’s notice and the tents had been 
called in. I could not find any case 
where rations had been issued since 
August 5. There is no employment 
for colored people except on the levee. 
The stave mill where they are regu- 
larly employed was badly damaged and 
will be closed for many months. 


NE of the Red Cross workers 

drove around with me and 
pointed out the work they have com- 
pleted. It was almost exclusively 
white property. In showing me one 
house on which repairs had been made 
and household goods replaced she re- 
marked that it belonged to a widow. 
It was one of the better houses in 
town, and she explained that it was 
done first because of the _ policy 
to give first attention to widows. This

applied only to white widows. All of 
the more substantial houses have been 
repaired, most of them with Red Cross 
aid. One exceptional case was pointed 
out to me, the house of a man who 
was doing the work himself, being paid 
for the work by the Red Cross. The 
worker admitted that this man was 
colored, but explained apologetically 
that he was a very superior colored 
man. 

The real explanation of the discrim- 
ination in Melville seemed to me to 
lie in the method used, which differs 
from that of other areas. Rehabilita. 
tion there has been worked out on a 
case-work basis. Every application for 
aid is investigated very thoroughly and 
the entire family situation as to re. 
sources, liabilities, losses and need as 
certained and verified. In the light of 
this information the worker recom- 
mends the amount needed. This case 
is presented first to the Red Cross Area 
Director, and when approved by him 
is presented to the local Committee, 
This Committee is made up of lead- 
ing citizens, usually a banker, a real 
estate man, a lawyer or two, a clergy- 
man and a doctor. I have known a 
Red Cross Committee to have a Labor 
representative, but I have never known 
one to have a Negro representative. 
Each case when presented is voted on 
by this group, and the amount of the 
award thus decided. Nearly always 
this decision is final, although it can 
be changed by the Area Director. The 
Committee has a good deal of power 
and its recommendations receive seri- 
ous consideration and are extremely 
likely to be acted upon. My supposi- 
tion in regard to the action of the lo- 
cal Committee in Melville was con- 
firmed by a conversation which I had 
with a gentleman whom I met in the 
City Hall. I had been introduced as 
a Red Cross worker from Vicksburg 
and he began telling me some of the 
difficulties of life in a town where at 
least 65% of the population was col- 
ored. I applied the stimulus, “of 
course you Southerners understand the 
Negroes as we Northerners can’t”, and 
he responded immediately. It seemed 
that that was only too true but that 
unfortunately most Northerners did 
not realize it. Their Red Cross work- 
ers, in fact, had come in and attempted 
to carry out a most outrageous plan by 
which white and colored cases were to 
be treated alike. The Committee, of 
which he was a member, had had con- 
siderable difficulty in educating them 
but had at last succeeded and antici- 
pated no trouble in that line. No plan 
involving equality between white and 
colored would be tolerated in that 
town for a minute. It is probable that 
an informal agreement was made 
whereby white cases were to have first 
attention. 


THE Crisis 





Ma 





“We Are Glad to Report”, 


—In the Language of George F. Babbitt, 


66 USINESS has been good with us during 1927.” Maybe we wouldn’t report 
anything else. But one item has more significance than you may realize from 
this statement. That is, Colored People are departing from the old idea of 

life insurance as a funeral benefit. 


Our VICTORY A-A SPECIAL was prepared in March, 1927, to be issued only in 
larger amounts, with $2,500.00 as the minimum, for a limited number of Select Risks. 
As announced in THE CRISIS, maximum benefits, including total and permanent dis- 
ability income and a waiver of premium, with double indemnity for accidental death, 
could be included because of a more careful selection of the risks, and the reduced ex- 
penses involved in the larger amounts of insurance. 


Between the 28th of March and the 31st of December, 1927, Colored People paid for 
348 of these policies, for a total of $1,106,500.00 of insurance. In the nine months 
since the VICTORY A-A SPECIAL was announced, this one policy has constituted 
a fifth of all our new business. The average policy is about $3,000.00 and more than 
half the people who buy it are between the ages of 27 and 41 years. 


This causes us to say that Colored People are buying Life Insurance for other pur- 
poses than a nominal funeral benefit. 


During 1928 discriminating people will find in the VICTORY A-A SPECIAL in- 
creased facilities for building up from year to year assured incomes for dependents, 
provisions for the education of children, for the payment of mortgages, protection 
from creditors in the development of business enterprise, and, in general, relief from 
most of the cares and worries about unforeseen circumstances that overshadow a busy 
and productive life-time.

HARTSHORN MEMORIAL 
COLLEGE 


Richmond, Va. 


NOW—An Academy 
Eventually—A College for 
t he Separate 
Education of 
Young Women. 












This institution which has been set apart for 
the separate education of young women ever 
since its founding in 1883, will, in the immediate 
future, devote every energy upon grade, and, espe- 
cially, academic work only, since college work 
has been discontinued for the present. It is an 
accredited high school by the State of Virginia, 
and offers two courses: a General Course and a 
College Preparatory Course which will admit to 
any college. 

Hartshorn offers, besides its pure scholastic cur- 
riculum, a home influence where the development 
of Christian character is the fundamental purpose.

Student Volunteer Movement 
(Continued from page 84) 
Frances Williams McLemore, Na- 
tional Student Secretary, Y. W. C. A. 

The convention discussed denomina- 
tionalism in the Mission fields and 
stood for eliminating them from all 
future endeavors. 

Equality of the races came in for 
heavy endorsement especially on the 
part of returned missionaries. This 
note was also in evidence as every non- 
white speaker or student expressed 
himself. 

White and Negro delegates from 
the following Southern States travel- 
led together in Pullman cars to and 
from Detroit: Virginia, North Caro- 
lina, South Carolina, Georgia, Flor- 
ida, Tennessee, Alabama and Texas. 
From all reports there was in all this 
fraternalism most helpful fellowships 
and contacts in Interracial Good-Will 
and understanding.

“A Mission of Love and Literacy”, 
in the January Graphic Survey. And 
then, step by step, she describes how, 
in 1862, the founders of this school, 
situated on St. Helena’s Island off the 
coast of South Carolina, surmounted 
formidable difficulties in demonstrat- 
ing that the most backward of the 
slaves would respond to teaching. In 
a log cabin, Penn was born—and with 
it the old spiritual

In the February issue of the same 
magazine, Miss Cooley tells “How We 
Brought Farms to the School”. This 
is the story of the second “revolution” 
in the countryside round about the 
Penn School. Miss Cooley describes 
the shift from academic education to 
vocational training. Both articles are 
illustrated by crayons from life by 
Winold Reiss. 

“The Relations of White and Col- 
oured Races” by Albert Schwietzer in 
the Contemporary Review for January 
is one of the most unbiased statements 
of colonization we have read. Mr. 
Schwietzer says that the right of man 
to live where his life has been devel- 
oped, is menaced by colonization. The 
social, economic and political situation 
of primitive people changes when the 
white man arrives with his gun pow- 
der. Independence, Mr. Schwietzer 
says, is not lost when a new form of 
government is proclaimed; but it is 
lost in the commercial exploitation of

which political colonization should be 
a corrective. 

Marcet Haldeman-Julius tells 
“What Negro Students Endure in 
Kansas” in the Haldeman-Julius 
Monthly for January. Negro stu- 
dents at Kansas University can not 
register for the last two years in the 
College of Medicine; they are discrim- 
inated against in the School of Fine 
Arts and in the Department of Physi- 
cal Education; they are barred from 
athletic competition; and no colored 
student at Teachers College can do 
practice teaching in the primary grades. 
Mrs. Haldeman-Julius makes a sin- 
cere plea for the abolishing of racial 
discrimination in the colleges of Kan- 
sas. 

“Abyssinia, Land of Babel” oon- 
tains within its boundaries more racial 
and religious elements than any sin- 
gle independent state in the world 
according to Kurt Lubinski in the 
Living Age for December 1.  Per- 
haps the most amazing falsehood about 
that dusky empire which he voices is 
“the deep-seated prejudice against the 
Negro, paralleled in intensity only by 
that of the Southern part of the United 
States”! Shades of Ellis! 

American interference in Nicara- 
guan affairs is not only contemporary 
history according to V. H. Von Cra- 
mon in the same magazine for De- 
cember 15. 

In the Labour Monthly for Octo- 
ber, Clements Kadalie, National Sec- 
retary of the Industrial and Commer- 
cial Workers’ Union of South Africa, 
discusses “The Old and the New 
Africa”: the Africa of 400 years ago 
when a pastoral people with its own 
civilizations and primitive forms of 
government ruled the Dark Continent ; 
and the Africa of today when Euro- 
pean capitalism dictates African poli- 
cies. Mr. Kadalie says: “We are 
not fighting the white man as a white 
man; we are fighting for elementary 
political and human rights for our- 
selves and our children.” 

Eugene Gordon in the American 





Mercury for February discusses “The 
Negro’s Inhibitions” with that particu- 
lar sportiveness we have long ascribed 
to Mencken himself. Notwithstand- 
ing, Mr. Gordon states the case quite 
unadorned—how in the glare of pale- 
faced ridicule, dusky Americans have 
been laughed into curbing their in- 
dividual inclinations, preferences and 
predilections. After all, in America 
the standard is white—as in Africa it 
it is black. 

“Harlem Says ‘Bye Bye Honey’ to 
Florence Mills” by W. A. MacDonald 
in the Bookman for February is a re- 
print of the newspaper story which 
appeared in the Boston Evening Tran- 
script during November. Mr. Mac- 
Donald does not hand us the custom- 
ary “sob stuff” we have grown to ex- 
pect from a story of this kind; but 
with an Olympian gesture gives us a 
creation—the climax of a_ beautiful 
novel. 
feeling that Florence Mills has not 
danced her last dance—has not sung 
her last song; but that she is to be 
with us always—the scintillating spirit 
mascot of Negro Art.

@ The slave trade between Portu- 
guese Africa and the mines of South 
Africa, usually camoflaged under the 
title of Recruitment of Native Labor 
is threatened by the reluctance of the 
Portuguese Government to renew the 
old treaty. South Africa and English 
investors are very much upset. During 
the third quarter of 1927, 18,483 
black laborers were taken from Moz- 
ambique to the Transvaal and 9,791 
were re-patriated. 
@ Lieutenant General Tilkins has 
been made Governor General of the 
Belgian Congo to succeed Mr. Rutten, 
who has resigned. Tilkins has had a 
purely military education. 
@ The African group of Belgium has 
raised 264,000 francs to erect the Stan-
