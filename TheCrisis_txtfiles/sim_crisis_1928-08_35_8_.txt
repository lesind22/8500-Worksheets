Another Progressive Step 
of the 


Southern Aid Society 





Home Office Group 


} — a of Va., Inc. 












Gratifying reports of improvement in the health and mortality ratings of. 
colored people are frequently noted in the press, but seldom, if ever, is there 
any credit given the Negro Fraternals, Industrial Sick Benefit, Industrial Life 
and Ordinary Life Insurance Companies for this commendable race progress. 





These race institutions by providing during periods of illness or other dis- 
ability, weekly cash benefits, and by paying promptly death claims following 
the death of policyholders, and by giving healthful and gainful employment 
to thousands of colored men and women, have been potent factors in lowering 
the sick and death rates of the race. In fact, they have made it possible for 
the humblest as well as the more fortunate homes to have proper medical at- 
tention, hospital service when needed, proper food and care during periods of 
illness and disability, thereby materially reducing the periods and frequency of 
illness and disability and consequently prolonging the lives of thousands of race 
people. Then, too, the better incomes provided by the employment offered by 
these institutions have contributed much to the improvement of the home life, 
health and well-being of the colored people. 





The Southern Aid Society of Virginia, Inc., was among the pioneers in these 
health conservation measures, and is pleased to announce that on account of the 
improvement in the health and mortality status of the race, it will issue, begin- 
ning July 2, 1928, a more liberal Policy Centract, providing, for One Small 
Premium, protection against Sickness, Accident and Death.

WE PAY OUR CLAIMS 


S a present or prospective policyholder you may be interested to know that this Company 
pays its claims “with commendable promptness.” The following is the record of claims 
paid since the Company began business in March, 1924: 


RECORD OF CLAIMS PAID 


Year of Ordinary Industrial Total 

Payment Claims Claims Paid 

1924 $4,500.00 none $4,500.00 
1925 1,020.00 " 1,020.00 
1926 7,469.01 $835.00 8,304.01 
1927 23,264.17 5,240.00 28,504.17 
1928 to June 30 26,550.10 2,327.33 28,877.43 


TOTAL = $62,803.28 $8,402.33 $71,205.61 


Premiums received by the Company from these policyholders amounted to a little more than 
$4,500.00. 


The report of examination of the Company by the Illinois Insurance Department, dated April 
30th, 1928, has the following statement which we do not object to you reading without any 
abbreviation in the copy: 


“During the period covered by this examination the Company has contested or settled by com- 
promise four claims totaling $3,500.00. Your examiners reviewed each of these claim files, as 
well as those of numerous other death losses incurred during the same period. In each case the 
Company’s action was fully justified by the facts as disclosed by the proofs of loss in file. It 
may be said further that the Company’s claim settlements are made with commendable prompt- 
ness and observance of policy provisions.” 


We are rather glad of the opportunity, after four short years, to report to you an established 
record for good faith in the payment of claims. This record can have more than casual in- 
terest for you in the development of plans which you do not wish to have interrupted by death 
or other unforseen circumstances. Give full name, occupation, and date of birth in writing the

A Record of the Darker Races 





W. E. Burcuarpt Du Bors, Editor and Manager 








HAT is a political campaign? 
Hear what the High School 
Teacher says: “There are in.all gov- 
ernments various questions of policy. 


_ They fall into two main categories and 


there are two parties which advocate 
them called Conservatives and Liber- 
als or Rights and Lefts or Republicans 
and Democrats. In a campaign the 
chosen candidates of these parties dis- 
cuss by articles, speeches and radio, the 
chief questions of political policy and 
the answers of their own party.’”— 
Thus speaks the Teacher and what she 
says ain't so.—There are a dozen 
questions fronting modern nations and 
they can’t be crammed into two main 
categories.—Hence the Third parties 
and blocs and cartels and groups in 
every legislature—Hence the frenzied 
effort of politicians to stop discussion, 
choke revolt, and penalize difference 
of opinion—The only difference be- 
tween Republicans and Democrats is 
the difference between the individuals 
who will draw the salaries and dis- 
tribute economic privileges for the next 
four years.—A political campaign is 
an organized effort to stop discussion

have not made any effort to be rated by 
any other state except New York State

both of which refuse to give our applica- 
tion serious consideration. We have also 
applied to the North Central Association, 
but they refuse to enter the territory of 
any other accrediting agency, therefore, 
we have been unable to get any action 
there. We are at present knocking at 
the door of the Association of American 
Universities. I am hopeful that we may 
get some results by their next meeting 
in November.” 


Many of the colleges are recognized 
and rated by the Department of Edu- 
cation, especially that of North Caro- 
lina. 


Among the outstanding happen- 


ings of the year among colored col- 
leges have been the inauguration of a 
new President at Lincoln; the erec- 
tion and dedication of a new medical 
school at Howard, which cost equipped, 
$500,000; the fulfillment of the condi- 
tions by which Fisk University has re- 
ceived an endowment of over a million 
dollars; the completion of two new 
dormitories and a gymnasium at the 
Virginia Normal and Industrial In- 
stitute; the celebration of the Six- 
tieth Anniversary of Talladega Col- 
lege, with a dedication of its new din- 
ing hall; at Orangeburg, a new Agri- 
cultural and Science Building and 
Practice cottage have been erected at a 
cost of $135,000; a hospital has been 
dedicated at Tougaloo College; an 
Alumnus gymnasium at Knoxville; 
and at Prairie View a girls’ dormitory, 
costing $115,000, and an $85,000 hos- 


pital have been erected.

HE general attitude of these col- 
leges may be indicated by extracts 
from their reports. There are still col- 
leges which have never had Negro stud- 
ents. This is true of Princeton, Lehigh 
and several others. Vassar had one 
student of Negro descent in the past 
unknowingly, and has never. admitted 
another. Bryn Mawr has broken her 
long record and has at present two col- 
ored students, one undergraduate and 
one in the graduate school. Barnard 
kas one student. 
Most of the institutions that write 
on the subject say that they make no 
discrimination. For instance: 


Armour Institute: 


“We accept them on the same basis as 
any other students. It seems, though, 
that few of them succeed in continuing 
their work to the end.”

Iowa Wesleyan: ; 
“We have no such students here. We 
should be glad, however, to enroll them if 


students of real ability and promise ap 
plied.” 


College of the City of New York: 


In regard to your fourth inquiry, let 
me say that the College treats Negro 
students on precisely the same basis as 
all others, making no distinction of any 
sort for or against any student because 
of his race.” 


University of Pennsylvania: 


“The University has no special policy 
toward Negro students. It has accepted 
all who have been able to satisfy the en- 
trance requirements and has continued 
them toward graduation as long as they 
coritinue to meet the scholastic require- 
ments of the different faculties. There 
is no color distinction whatsoever.” 


Pennsylvania State College: 


“We cannot admit young colored 


women. Are glad to admit Pennsylvania 
colored boys.” 


Brown University: 
“We have no special policy toward 
Negro students. In fact, we have very 


few here, and they are usually high 
grade students.”

Smith College: 

“As far as I can now see, we have no 
contemplated change of policy toward 
Negro students, who are received on 
their merits as other students are.” 

Temple University: 

“May I say, in reference to the last 
paragraph of your letter, that Temple 
University has never made any distinc- 
tion between its students because of race 
or religion, and that it does not intend 
to change this policy.” 

Purdue University: 

“The University has no special policy 
relative to Negro students. They en- 
roll in the University and participate in 
the class exercises the same as any other 
group of students. From all that I can 
see, the colored students come and go on 
the Purdue campus with equal rights and 
privileges.” 

University of Illinois: 

“The University makes no distinction 
or discrimination in its attitude or treat- 
ment of its students regarding their 
color or race, hence it has no policy to- 
wards Negro students other than that 
towards all of its students.”

Illinois Wesleyan University: 

“No prejudice so far as I know.” 

DePauw University: 

“We have no particular policy at De- 
Pauw; no race or color distinction is 
made, hence none who applies and is able 
to pay for an education is turned away.” 

New York University: 

“IT know of no special policy of the 
University, nor of any contemplated 
policy affecting Negro students, or stu- 
dents of any other race or color, as a 
class or group. The administrative offi- 
cers of the University and of the differ- 
ent colleges and schools, and the faculty 
advisers, in the exercise of their func- 
tions are free to confer with the in- 
dividual student and to offer such advice 
as in their judgment may lead to the best 
progress and greatest happiness of the 
student in the preparation for his future 
work.” 

Simmons College: 


“No discrimination whatever.” 


OT all of these allegations are 
N quite as true as they seem. Tem- 
ple University, for instance, refuses to

courses. New York University refuses

to admit girls to the Physical Training 
Course and discriminates sometimes in 
other ways. There is much discrimina- 
tion, of course, at the University of 
Illinois and some at the University of 
Pennsylvania. Some of the institutions 
admit discrimination, 


Oberlin says, for instance: 


“We have not changed our policy in 
regard to Negro students, and do not 
anticipate doing so in the near future so 
far as I know. Negro students are ad- 


mitted to all classrooms and laboratories - 


on exactly the same basis as white stu- 
dents.” 


This means that colored students 
have difficulty in getting rooms in 
dormitories, which is a serious difficulty 
in a small town. 


Wesleyan of Connecticut says 
frankly: 


“We have no special policy toward 
Negro students. We treat them like 
everyone else. Of course, we have to 
make arrangements sometimes regarding 
rooming in the dormitories, but it has 
always been possible to do so without 
trouble and we do not find any friction

The Little Page 


By EFFIE LEE NEWSOME 


Calendar Chat 


HERE is a house wren jingling 
little bells just a few rods away 
from here. The busy little song re- 
minds me of an interesting discovery 
that I made one day. Father House 
Wren was on the edge of the barn 
door darting about like a little brown 
mouse and chirping quickly. Then he 
adjusted himself somewhat under the 
eaves and began to sing. Head thrown 
back and throat swelling he sent the 
clear eager notes from his open mouth. 
After listening for some time I de- 
cided to look inside the barn for Jenny 
Wren. I thought there must be eggs 
or infant Wrens hidden in a nearby 
nest, and the Wren folks were always 
flashing in and out of the barn. So I 
went to look. 


F course it was there. But how 

Mother Wren scolded me for 
climbing up to pry ‘into her nest! 
Mother Robin and Mother Morning 
Dove fly away when people come to 
their nests, but not so little Jenny 
Wren. She seemed to cry in her hur- 
ried chuck-chucks, “You busybody, 
busybody, busybody! Shame!” And 
then she called to Father Wren and 
together they rushed about on the raf- 
ters, little wings fluttering. Father 
Wren soon flew out again and left it 
to Jenny Wren. Head held down and 
emphatically forward, upright tail 
twitching she fretted about the barn 
while I looked at the nest in the crev- 
ace. 

It was made of little dry twigs and 
stems and a pine sprig minus needles. 
There were white feathers standing up 
conspicuously within. They looked 
much too large and plentiful for the 
little nest. How disappointing it was 
to realize that I could not look down 
into it. What was there? A feather 
moved in the slightest way as though 
some fairy had sighed. 

“A baby wren must have moved 
that,” I thought, and waited. 

One tiny yellow beak looked up, then 
another. How could Mother Wren 
have dreamed that any one would 
touch such marvelous toys as little 


birds? 


ON THE PELICAN’S BACK 


NOWDOWN was a pelican. He 

was bathing his large flat feet in 
a stream one day and saw reflected in 
the water something that looked like a 
cloud or a cluster of lotus blooms. It 
was Snowdown himself, lily white.

“How can I attract attention to my- 
self ?”’ he asked. 

But the water remained silent. 

“T think I shall give a concert. And 
since I like my shadow so well, I shall 
insist that all birds taking part on the 
program shall be white as I am. 
Good. A concert!” cried Snowdown 
loudly. “Come and get on my back. 
The program will begin.” 

“Yes,” replied buoyant Baltimore 
Oriole poking his jetty head through 
the reeds, “I am ready.” 


NOWDOWN peered at him in- 

differently and waddled slightly 
away. “Sorry, but you cannot be 
used.” 

“What about me?” piped a Snow 
Bunting that was en route to Spitz- 
bergen for the summer. 

“Very good.” Snowdown nodded 
at the chubby white bunting that 
seated himself on the pelican’s back. 

“Concert!” announced the pelican 
again. 

“May I come?” cried Father Robin 
blithely as he overheard the call while 
Mrs. Robin and the babies were out 
for a walk. 

“Let’s see. No,” croaked Snow- 
down, “you won’t do for my program.” 

Robin tossed his proud black head 
and sped away. 

“Concert!”  shrieked Snowdown 
loudly, and the snow bunting helped 
this time. 

“May I participate?” asked a su- 
perb peacock from India. He spread 
his snowy tail like a bride’s veil 
on the grass, then lifted it like a fan. 
His ghost-white feathers looked al- 
most transparent. “I cannot get on 
your back,” said he.’ “But I can act 
as usher.”

P came a gay bobolink. “I'll take 
part,” he declared. 

But Snowdown did not reply. And 
dashing Robert of Lincoln with his 
dark head and stunning black outft 
darted off. 

An Arctic owl flew down as though 
he had dropped from a cloudlet. “I'm 
ready,” he said. ‘“Where’s the concert 
to be?” 

“On my back. Come!” 

And the froth-white Arctic owl took 
a place on Snowdown’s back. 

“Concert!” the pelican repeated. 

“Good,” cried a catbird. “Just in 


Time, he was about to say when he 
discovered that Snowdown was looking 
in another direction. The neat dark 
gray bird with the black head traveled 
away. 

“Concert!” Snowdown again spoke. 


ND the snowy heron came 

grandly stepping after a dinner 
of fish. His crest was like ocean spray. 
“Concert, did you say?” 

“Yes,” quickly answered Snow- 
down. “Stand here beside me. Con- 
cert! Concert!” 

Meadowlark and Brown Thrasher 
and some Thrushes and the dainty 
Wood Pewee, a Bluebird, a Cardinal 
—-all of these came. 

But a Ptarmigan flew up and was 
accepted instead. So the little dark- 
headed Bluebirds, the brown birds and 
all those others flew off. For they 
were not white like the pelican and the 
snow bunting and the Indian peacock 
and the snowy heron and the Arctic 
owl and the ptarmigan. 

“Let us have our own concert,” 
brightly suggested Cardinal as they 
landed together near a stream. “Let 
us call the other birds.” 

And back came Sir Oriole with his 
jetty face and Bobolink and Robin and 
Catbird. Together they all sang. Even 
the aspen leaves paused in their quiv- 
ering. The little brooks stood still. 
Then the woods shook with wonder at 
that marvelous melody. 

“Now you sing,” cried black Bobo- 
link to the pelican and the Indian pea- 
cock and the ptarmigan and the bunt-

| THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 


i 


HE nineteenth annual conference 

of the N. A. A. C. P. opened in 
the Philharmonic Auditorium in Los 
Angeles, Wednesday night, June 27. 
Dr. H. C. Hudson, President of the 
Los Angeles branch, presided, and 
made the welcoming address, to which 
the Mayor of Los Angeles responded. 
The President of the United States 
sent a letter in which he advocated an 
Anti-Lynching law and said: 

“They have come up from slavery to 
be prominent in education, the profes- 
sions, art, science, agriculture, banking, 
and commerce. It is estimated that 
50,000 of them are on the Government 
pay rolls, drawing about $50,000,000 
each year. They have been the recipi- 
ents of presidential appointments and 
their professional ability has arisen to a 
sufficiently high plane so that they have 
been intrusted with the entire manage- 
ment and control of the great Veterans’ 
Hospital at Tuskegee, where their con- 
duct has taken high rank.” 


Dr. Du Bois spoke of disfranchise- 
ment : 


“The barring of Negroes from the 
polls in the South,” said Dr. Du Bois, 
“encourages oligarchy. It enables cliques 
to nullify not simply the 14th and 15th 
Amendments but the 19th, giving the 
right to vote to women. And, finally, it 
entirely vitiates the normal distribution 
of voting power throughout the nation. 


“It accomplishes this not simply by 
disfranchising Negroes. The population 
in Southern states has doubled and by 
reason of woman suffrage the voting 
population ought to have quadrupled; 
but actually, as a matter of fact, the vot- 
ing population has increased less than 
50 per cent, showing that not only have 
two million Negroes been disfranchised 
but more than two million whites.” 


And all through the meeting Los 
Angeles sang. 


_ Thursday there were business ses- 
sions to discuss the branches and meth- 
ods of support. On Thursday night, 
with Dr. Somerville presiding, a Jew- 
ish Rabbi, Rudolph Coffee, spoke of 
minorities. 

“America is infinitely richer because 
of Paul Laurence Dunbar, Roland 
Hayes and Florence Mills. How much 
poorer would America be if we never 
ad your magnificent contribution to 
music? The white man simply cannot 
combine your undying optimism despite 
terrible oppression with confidence. in 
God as expressed in the Negro melodies. 
Therefore, I say, America needs the 
Negro and bids you stand firm. If you 


surrender, America is poorer, but you 
cannot surrender.” 


And S. G. Pandit, an Indian, dis-

cussed the superstition of race superi- 
ority: 

“And what is life but expression of 
one’s self, of one’s ‘ownness’? We should 
not be slavish imitators of anybody what- 
soever. Every individual has a unique 
contribution which he alone can make to 
the great human symphony slowly but

surely perfecting itself. To the extent 
that he is thwarted from self-expression 
all humanity is rendered poorer.” 

Friday the Women’s Auxiliaries met 
and the prize babies were presented; 
while in the afternoon THE Crisis had 
a session. Friday night, with Dr. 
George W. Lucas of New Orleans pre- 
siding, William Pickens talked of the 
economic interpretation of race prob- 
lems:

his own biscuit in the hotel dining room 
is more of an annoyance to the average 
white American than is the soiled and 
sweating Negro back in the hotel kit- 
chen, who is actually handling every- 
body’s biscuits. The ruling caste in Mis- 
sissippi makes passionate speeches and 
drastic laws against any legitimate and 
honorable mixing of the blood of the two 
races, but produces a hundred thousand 
mulattoes by illegitimate contacts. Ne- 
gro maids may arrange a white woman’s 
hair, brush her teeth and suckle her 
babies, but may not sit on the far end of 
a long pew in her church. 

“These seeming inconsistencies no 
longer puzzle us when we apply the law 
to them: for Negro slaves, Negro cooks, 
and other Negro servants represent eco- 
nomic subjection; while the Negro free- 
man, the Negro hotel guest and even the 
Negro sister-in-the-Lord, if in the same 
pew, represent economic equality.” 

On Saturday, we rode and played 
and danced; and Sunday, representa- 
tives of the conference talked in twen- 
ty-two white and colored churches. 
Sunday afternoon came the great mass 
meeting, and the singing of Florence 
Cole Talbert. The Governor of Cali- 
fornia was there, and James Weldon 
Johnson and Robert W. Bagnall spoke.

“We invite a comparison of the self- 
styled patriotic groups which have re- 
cently set themselves up as arbiters of 
Americanism and have seen fit to find 
this organization wanting, with the Na- 
tional Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People. Has any of these 
groups a constructive program which will 
bring about the safety of the individual, 
larger opportunity for education and 
training in true Americanism, the carry- 
ing out of the principles of the Constitu- 
tion of the United States, the increase of 
the wealth of the submerged and the 
making of a richer life for all citizens?” 


Monday morning was the day of the 
Junior Division and the Branches 
came in again to discuss organization in 
the afternoon. Monday night Lew 
Head talked of the colored races: 


“Civilization will reach its highest 
achievements when the brown races of 
the world have first, conceived the need 
of consecrated leadership, second, spon- 
sored those leaders and third, through 
them energized an improved civilization 
on this earth. There is a power in the 
colored people of the United States that 
either has not been discovered or, if dis- 
covered, has not been harnessed for prac- 
tical use. 

“The present civilization has about 
spent itself. Humanity is on the verge 
of a tremendous crisis. Just what direc-

take, is now back where it was when 
civilization started, waiting for respon-

ship. It is not beyond belief that out of 
the brown races of the world, over half 
of its population, will come this leader- 
ship.”

democracy : 


Steffens discussed 


“The radicals are the only friends of 
the colored people, just as these ‘disre- 
putable’ radicals are the only friends of 
women, of labor, of farmers, of all the 
minorities. These minorities, by the 
way, could be a majority if they would 
play the game, first alone, then together. 
For most people belong to some minor- 
ity.” 

Bishop Martin talked of social con- 
ditions: 

“Go into many of our towns and you 
might lay down the rule that where the 
pavement ends there the blacks begin. 
Now this is not of our own choosing but 
is the result of conditions forced upon 
us. Restricted districts, prohibitive pur- 
chase price for houses, exorbitant rents, 
threats and abuse, are only some of the 
means employed for adding insult to our 
already sorely injured group.”

Bearing stiffly, proudly 
On our heads uplifted 
All the world’s burdens. 


Borne by us, the pharaohs 
Built their stone tombs: 
They are in the tombs. 


Borne by us, the Romans 
Bled the world to pallor: 
They lie under their swords. 


Borne by us, the English, 

Spanish, Dutch, French, Belgians, 
Germans, and Americans, 

Lolled away to weakness, 
Drenched themselves in poison, 
Bled their hearts in warfare: 
And their ghosts still ride us. 


We are the burden bearers, 
Infinitely ancient, 

Bearing still uplifted 

All the world’s burdens: 
And we dream the burdens. 


A. M. et Mme. Etienne Mathon 


E came to the isle of Toussaint 
L’Ouverture 
Seeking his spirt: not a flowery thing, 
But noble feeling that could not endure 
Oppression’s iron-fanged and alien sting. 
We sought for liberty—equality— 
Fraternity, those rights of every man, 
A holy soul-awakening trinity 
Toward which mankind has reached, 
since mind began. 
All these we found in you, in amplest 


measure: 
Yet we found, friendly Mathons, here 
with you 
A bright bepetalled fragrant rosy treas- 
ure 
Which you have shared cordially with 
us too: 


And we'll recall your hospitable graces, 
Your high dreams, and the roses’ 
hopeful faces. 


Meringue Noire 
, For Jolibois Fils 
LACK as a starless midnight domed 


with clouds 
Should be your garb, people of Haiti: 
black 
For liberty dead and tombed in living 
shrouds, 


For independence fallen at a foul attack; 


August, 1928 


THE POET'S CORNER 


Black for the honor of a vaster land, 
A suicide on your hospitable shore; 
Black for friendship slain by an alien 


hand, 

Black for kindly esteem deserved no 
more. 

Publish your mourning, a_ sepulchral 
robe 


Not to be cast aside, until the soul 
Of freedom, exiled too long from man’s 


globe, 
Descends again to make you great and 
whole, 
A pascal resurrection: joy out of 
gloom, 


And liberty rearisen from its tomb. 


Meringue Haitien 
For Etienne Mathon 
"hen say your bright green beauty 


masks swift death: 

That the sluggish centipede, the scorpion, 

The furred tarantula, lurk in each path, 

Eager to prick you with a death-dark 
sting, 

Crouching to spring upon you unaware, 

Hiding even in your housed security,— 

Shadowing existence with dark fears: 

All libel. There is no more injury 

In your fanged hibiscus bloom, your 
lancing palm. 

Only one crawling thing that fouls your 
soil 

Is fanged with brisk bitterly destructive 
harm, 

Poisoning your laughter, your quick 
beautiful smile, 

Your happiness, your freedom, to his 
shame: 
The paleface fanged grasper of every 

clime. 


Retrospect Haitien 
For Percival Thoby 


HESE, then, we leave behind, Haiti, 
with you: 
Dazzling sunlight; cool, overwhelming 
night; 
A caged solitary ringdove, with its coo 
Perpetual at this exile from its mate; 
A dark race darkly straight beneath 
gross burdens 
That can not 4ull quick laughter on 
quick faccs; 
Cool mansions drowsing in sweet shaded 
gardens; 
Thatched huts parched on the harsh 
hilly places; 
Cringing deceit—a little; and insolence 
From alien lips; dreams of an impossible 
bliss 
When freedom finds again a residence 
In such a scorched Paradise as this: 
A fair land, with a hot and twisted 
smile— 
The haggard beauty of a ravished isle.

South Wind 
By MARION GREEN SCOTT 


OUTH Wind, South Wind, where 
are you blowing? 
What do you see in your roamings afar? 
“Up in the blue of infinity 
Stars atwinkle in ecstacy 
Nestled deep in a sapphire sea.” 


South Wind, South Wind, what faery 
vision 
Do you behold as you blow o’er the 
waves? 
“Water of crystal and amethyst 
Flung together in golden mist, 
Rainbow flowers by pixies kist.” 


South Wind, South Wind, what other 


rovers 
Share in your eager and rapturous 

flight? 
“Skylarks aflame with the morning 

light, 


Fierce-eyed eagles at noonday bright, 
Thrushes atrill with coming night.” 


South Wind, South Wind, may I not 


follow 
You through the limitless reaches of 
sky? 
“You are, but earth-born created of 
clay, 


Too frail to travel my pathless way, 

But if your heart is attuned unto 
mine 

Listen, and share in my rapture di- 
vine.” 


Fulfillment 
By GEORGIA D. JOHNSON 


At last I gaze into your eyes and 
know 


The tryst is kept I held against the 
years 

With dire misgivings and with secret 
fears 

Lest you be late, too late: time travels 
slow 

When lovers wait. The evening sun is 
low— 

The kindly earth an autumn garment 


wears 

All brown and golden, as a friend who 
shares 

The others’ fortune, in its ebb and flow. 


Drunk with belated rapture hand in 


hand 

At length together, as-I dreamed, we 
stand, 

I —s beating of your heart, and 
ee 


The wordless messages it would reveal; 
At last I gaze into your eyes and see 
The perfect answer to the call in me.

Our Negro “Intellectuals” 


OR nearly ten years, our Negro 

writers have been “confessing” the 
distinctive sordidness and triviality of 
Negro life, and making an exhibition 
»t their own unhealthy imagination, in 
the name of frankness and sincerity. 
Frankness is no virtue in itself, how- 
ever, as any father will tell his son, 
nor is sincerity. A dog or savage is 
“sincere” about his bestialities, but he 
is not therefore raised above them. The 
modern novel has been frankly and sin- 
cerely preoccupied with sex, but has 
not escaped an insane naturalism. It 
is a question, then, of the purpose for 
which one is being sincere. It is quite 
evident that the sincerity of Milton, of 
Fielding, and of Dr. Johnson is differ- 
ent in kind from the sincerity of Mr. 
D. H. Lawrence and Mr. James Joyce. 
If sincerity is to justify one in exploit- 
ing the lowest traits of human nature, 
and in ignoring that sense in man 
which Cicero says differentiates him 
from other animals,—his sense for 
what is decent—then ‘sincerity is a 
pander to a torpid animalism. 

The plea of sincerity, of war against 
hypocrisy and sham, therefore, is no 
defence for the exhibitionism of Mr. 
George S. Schuyler and Mr. Eugene 
Gordon, nor for the sensationalism of 
such works as Dr. Rudolph Fisher’s 
HIGH YALLER or Mr. Langston 
Hughes’ FINE CLOTHES TO 
THE JEW. The first two writers 
by their coarse frivolousness and scan- 
dalmongering falsely represent that the 
Negro has no self-respect. A bawling 
confession from the house-tops is a poor 
substitute for honest and discriminat- 
ing self-examination, in race criticism 
as in religion. Mr. Schuyler and Mr. 
Gordon may be clever intellectual gym- 
nasts; as such they belong with the

vaudeville, and not with the men who 
set new currents of thought moving in 
Negro life. Of our Menckenites, how- 
ever, more later; let us first include 
in our view those who ought to be 
termed our Van Vechtenites. Mr. 
Van Vechten is not responsible for the 
beginning of our literary effort to ap- 
pear primitive, but he brought the 
movement to its complete fruition, and 
gave it the distinction of his patronage. 


UR writers started almost ten 

years ago to capitalize the sensa- 
tional and sordid in Negro life, nota- 
bly in Harlem, by making it appear 
that Negro life is distinctive for its 
flaming “color”, its crude and primi- 
tive emotion. This facile acceptance 
of the old, romantic delusion of “racial 
literatures”, which goes back beyond 
Taine all the way to Mme. de Stael, 
was a convenient mould for the ener- 
gies of writers who had no tradition 
to guide them in treating Negro 
themes. What was more to the point, 
it interested the sophisticated reading 
public, at the height of the “jazz age” 
following the war, because it seemed 
to bring fresh and primitive forces to 
a jaded age. 

These young writers hit upon two 
means of injecting primitivistic color 
in their work; one, the use of the Har- 
lem cabaret and night life, and the 
other, a return to the African jungles. 
Since Mr. MacKay’s HARLEM 
DANCER, the cabaret has been an 
unhealthy obsession with these youths, 
who in their relative naiveté imagine 
that there is something profoundly stir- 
ring about the degradation of its 
habitués. Even the best writers, Mr. 
McKay, Mr. Cullen, Mr. Hughes, 
and Dr. Fisher, as well as many of 
their less gifted imitators, have ex- 


Croxton Williams 
Salutatorian 
A. and T., N. C. 


ploited the cabaret. The jazz band be. 
came the model which the Negro poet 
sought to imitate. It is particularly yp. 
fortunate that Mr. James Weldon 
Johnson should yield to this jazzy 
primitivism in choosing the title 
GOD’S TROMBONES for a work 
purporting to represent the Negro’s re. 
ligious fervor. Of course here, as 
always, the Negro movement must be 
seen in relation to the broader current 
of American literature. Mr. Waldo 
Frank, Mr. Scott Fitzgerald, and 
a host of other white authors were at 
the same time popularizing the jazz 
complex. In illustration, moreover, 
Mr. Miguel Covarrubias and Mr, 
Winold Reiss did more than Mr. 
Aaron Douglas and Mr. Richard 
Bruce to represent the Negro as essen- 
tially bestialized by jazz and the caba- 
ret. 


” this mad rush to make the Negro 
exhibit his sensational and primitiv- 
istic qualities, our young writers did 
not lack white support. Mr. Carl Van 
Doren encouraged them in this fashion: 
“But if the reality of Negro life is it- 
self dramatic, there are of course still 
other elements, particularly the emo- 
tional power with which Negroes live 
—or at least to me seem to live. What 
American literature decidedly needs at 
the moment is color, music, gusto, the 
free expression of gay or desperate 
moods. If the Negroes are not in a 
position to contribute these items, I 
do not know what Americans are.” 
Mr. Max Rheinhardt spoke of the ne- 
cessity for the Negro dramatist’s re- 
maining true to the original spon- 
taneity of his race by portraying “pure 
emotion, almost independent of words 
or setting”. This myth of the spiritual 
and artistic virtue of spontaneous emo-

“9 in the Negro was enthusiastically 
ad by Mr. Carl Van Vechten. 
I think that the severest charge one 
can make against Mr. Van Vechten is 
that he misdirected a genuine poet, who 
gave promise of a power and technique 
exceptional in any poetry, — Mr. 
Hughes. Mr. Van Vechten disclaims 
any influence upon Mr. Hughes’ first 
book, THE WEARY BLUES, for 
which he wrote a preface expressing 
undiluted primitivism. The evident 
reply is that the drop from the best 
poems of this first book to any of those 
in FINE CLOTHES TO THE 
JEW, which Mr. Van Vechten un- 
doubtedly did influence, is the real 
proof of his having finally misdirected 
Mr. Hughes. 


OW came the devastating result 

of the primitivism which our 
Negro writers had concocted and made 
a holy cause. NIGGER HEAVEN 
was the telos, the perfect flowering of 
the “cabaret school”. By means of the 
same sensational primitivism and the 
creation of half a dozen cabarets which 
Harlem could never boast, Mr. Van 
Vechten warped Negro life into a fan- 
tastic barbarism. What was most per- 
nicious in NIGGER HEAVEN was 
the representation that the Negro up- 
per class is identical with the pleasure- 
seekers and cabaret-rounders. NIG- 
GER HEAVEN was the logical out- 
come of the forces our “intellectuals” 
had championed for five years, and in 
a very real sense these “intellectuals” 
were responsible for its -writing and 
its success. With its appearance there 
arose in the minds of many Negro 
writers and readers some doubt con- 
cerning the whole movement toward 
“color” and exhibitionism. The most 
prominent writers, however, could not 
evade the natural result of their own 
practice, and defended Mr. Van 
Vechten on the ground of artistic sin- 
cerity, for which they found proof 
chiefly in his mixing socially with Ne- 
groes. Here again the pretense of sin- 


cerity justified the most unalleviated 
sensationalism. In fact, the total ef- 
tect of the whole movement was that 
Negroes are sincerely bestial. 

An atavistic yearning for the Afri- 
can jungles, which was entirely sim- 
ulated, was the second device of these 
poets for adding “color” to the Negro. 
The desire of young poets to “dance 
naked under palm trees’, and to ex- 
press themselves in jungle loves has 
been the favorite device for making 
poetry authentically Negroid. Tom- 
toms, love-dances, strange passions and 
savage urges have been the parapher- 
nalia of almost every budding poet- 
aster. Even Mr. Cullen made especial 
use of the jungle urge in his early and 
best known poems, HERITAGE and 
THE SHROUD OF COLOR. This 
whole primitivistic interpretation of 
the Negro is the white man’s facile 
point of view, and our Negro “intel-: 
lectuals” wanted to appear as the white 
man would have them. The most im- 
portant assertion of the related prim- 
itivism of cabaret and jungle is the 
work of a white poet, Mr. Lindsay’s 
CONGO. There is nothing more for- 
eign to the Negro’s imagination than 
this yearning for savage Africa, and it 
is a false note every time it is struck 
by a Negro poet. The African tradi- 
tion which we want to uncover and 
make fruitful is certainly not that of 
savagery, but of self-containment, for- 
titude, and culture. 


At times the poets achieved some- 
thing beautiful and significant in spite 
of their material and creed. Mr. 
McKay’s poem, HARLEM SHAD- 
OWS touches on nobility and a 
higher imaginative view than most 
American realistic poetry ever reaches. 
The title poem of Mr. Hughes’ THE 
WEARY BLUES created a repre- 
sentative symbol for the frustration 
and inertia into which Negro life is 
penned. There were poems in McKay, 
Cullen, and Hughes which gave evi- 
dence of a higher understanding of 
Negro life, but this quality of their 


imagination was not developed. Mr. 
Hughes especially chose to exploit the 
meretricious themes of jazz, instead of 
developing the powers shown in such 
poems as AUNT SUE’S STORIES 
and WHEN SUE WEARS RED. 
The indubitable gift of Mr. Hughes 
and of one or two other poets was 
sacrificed to a dogma, which necessi- 
tated their being atavistic and “color- 
ful” at the expense of a full and experi- 
mental development of their imagina- 
tion. The untrammeled self-expression 
which the supporters of the movement 
claimed for it was actually freedom 
only to be as primitivistic as one liked. 
There was no freedom from the creed 
that a Negro poet ought to be barbaric. 
II 

UR primitivistic poets and story- 

tellers have been ousted from the 
stage lately by a rising group of young 
critics, writing for magazines and 
Negro newspapers. They are Menck- 
enites, largely inspired by their mas- 
ter’s attack upon Negro preachers and 
‘‘misleaders”, and his heralding of the 
self-critical Negro. Now the genuine 
critic is the individual who can fix 
upon the excellent and significant in 
the welter of all that is obvious and 
passing, and who can reveal how this 
seed may be made fruitful. Even 
though he must expose what is trivial 
or pernicious, he moves from a percep- 
tion of what is true. Such a critic 
will illustrate his higher standards by 
the point from which he attacks false 
standards. His criticism, then, is vital, 
even in the act of denying. We do not 
look to him for reform and solutions, 
but we do expect him to give currency 
to real and high principles. In apply- 
ing these standards with an esprit de 
finesse to the ever shifting flux of the 
energies which make for chaos, he will 
give perspective to the so-called “men 
of action”. 

A vital grasp upon standards, then, 
and the ability to apply them flexibly 
to the “gushing forth of novelties”

THE CONTINUING SONG 
HE Indus, published by Indian 


students in London, has an article 
by “an Indian” on Florence Mills: 


“The true artist has the world for a 
pedestal; the adventurer, after years of 
travel has nothing broader than _ his 
shoes.” So says a great writer. It is 
examplified to-day in the sadness that 
prevails over the loss of Florence Mills. 
Born in humble surroundings and be- 
longing to the coloured peoples that are 
usually despised, she worked her way up 
against tremendous odds, and won for 
herself, at the early age of twenty-six, 
a sacred place in the hearts of the peo- 
ples, coloured and white alike. Hers 
was a genius that had bridged over dif- 
ferences and worn down prejudices that 
had stood for generations. Her art had 
no limitations. Its appeal was as uni- 
versal as life. 

Many that had come to sneer had 
stayed to cheer. She captivated the most 
indifferent with the charm of her man-

ner and her naturalness. The exacting 
critic found himself swept off his feet 
with her irresistible personality and felt 
nothing but praise for the artist. Her 
voice of pure silver with a ring of 
pathos in it penetrated into the unfeeling, 
and stirred the depths that had hitherto 
not come to light, and her smile lit the 
faces of the cheerless with its own 
brightness—the brightness of unshed 
tears. 

In spite of her invariable success, she 
never forgot that she belonged to a race 
who is looked down upon, and that her 
mission in life was to elevate it in the 
opinion of the world. She set herself 
voluntarily this great duty with the con- 
viction that comes with a great truth 
and with the courage of a great right. 
She made her ideal the betterment of 
the coloured race. Her self-respect and 
dignity made her regret the lack of that 
footing of equality, which is the only 
means by which true fellowship and 
sociability can exist. 

The medium by which she sought to

establish this amity was her own art. 
Art in itself has no narrowness of vision 
and outlook. To delight an audience in 
face of opposition, expressed or unex- 
pressed, is a gift that falls to few. Her 
work and her art went side by side. 
In her, her mission had found a harbing- 
er of peace and good-will essential for 
the breaking down of age-long precon- 
ceptions; and from her, her co-workers 
will derive a new force and spirit to ani- 
mate their future activities. They can 
face the difficult task ahead with the 
noble example before them. Their suc- 
cess may be a long time to come, but the 
way has been paved to many a success by 
the sacrifices made by such ardent and 
devoted workers like her. Her sympa- 
thy will be a continual solace to the suf- 
ferers in the cause. Well she might 
have sung, with our nIdian poet:— 

“My last gift to you will be a tear 
dropped into the depth of your youth; 
it will make your smile all the sweeter, 
and bemist your outlook on the pitiless 
mirth of day.”

THE NEGRO VOTER 


CCORDING to the Census of 
1920, there were in the United 
States 60,886,520 persons twenty-one 
years of age and over. Of these 5,522,- 
475, or a little over 9 per cent were Ne- 
groes. Of these Negroes, 1,512,987 were 
illiterate, leaving a possible Negro vot- 
ing population of sufficient intelligence 
to read and write of over 4,000,000. 
Disfranchisement cuts this figure con- 
siderably. Neither whites nor Negroes 
in the District of Columbia vote. In 
Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, 
oma and Texas, there is a con- 
sderable Negro vote cast for presi- 
dential candidates, but Negro votes 
are not effective so far as Congressmen 
are concerned. In South Carolina, 
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi 
and Louisiana, nine-tenths of the Ne- 


August, 1928 









groes are disfranchised. ‘The possible 
Negro vote in these states is 2,722,048. 
This left in 1920, 2,800,427 possible 
Negro voters in the United States. 

Since that time, the Negro popula- 
tion has increased and the migration 
from South to North has transferred a 
considerable number of Negroes from 
disfranchisement to a territory where 
they can vote. It will, therefore, be 
possible for at least 3,000,000 and pos- 
sibly three and a quarter million of Ne- 
groes to vote in the next presidential 
election. 

These voters will be distributed 
roughly as follows: 

In the New England States, there 
will be 60,000 colored voters, out of a 
total vote of 4,500,000. In the Middle 
Atlantic States, there will be 500,000 
colored voters, out of a possible 13,- 
500,000. In the East North Central 
States, there will be 450,000 colored 
voters, out of a possible 13,000,000. In 
the West North Central States, 200,- 
000 colored voters, out of a possible 
7,250,000. In the South Atlantic 
States, the Negro voters will be in- 
effective except in Delaware, Mary- 
iand and West Virginia, where they 
will cast 250,000 votes, out of a pos- 
sible 1,750,000. In the Mountain and 
Pacific States, Negroes will cast per- 
haps 75,000 votes, out of a possible 
5,500,000. 

To this must be added two consider- 
ations: first of all, all persons, twenty- 
ene years of age and over in the United 
States for various reasons, do not vote. 
In the Presidential Election of 1920, 
only 26,674,171 votes were cast, out 
of the possible 60,886,520. If the 
Negro voter is alert, he may, therefore, 
cast even more than one-tenth of the 
actual vote, despite disfranchisement in 
the South. Certainly, in many of the 
states intelligent use of the Negro vote 
can bring results. 

We may assume that in 1928, the 
total vote cast in the following states 
and the Negro vote will be something 
as follows:

This, of course, will only be true in 
case the Negro attends to his election 
duties with unusual assiduity,—that is, 
votes even more largely than the white. 
That he ought to do this arises from 
his peculiar position. In every single 
one of these states, the Negro vote is 
important. 

Even in New England, while it 
forms only two or three per cent of the 
total vote, nevertheless, it is concen- 
trated in certain strategic centers, like 
Boston, Providence and New Haven, 
where it will effect the congressional 
vote; and with Smith as the Demo- 
cratic candidate the fight between Pro- 
testants and Catholics is going to be 
so close that the black voters will be 
needed. 

In the industrial East, New York, 
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the Ne- 
gro can cast 425,000 out of 6,500,000 
votes. This is between six and seven 
per cent, and that is a very im- 
portant bloc. The fight in the East is 
a fight between organized wealth and 
industry, on the one hand, and organ- 
ized iabor and radical reform on the 
other. The issues will be clouded. 
Smith is no enemy to organized wealth, 
and Hoover is no friend of organized 
labor. It will be hard for these ele- 
ments in many cases to choose between 
the two leaders. They will have, how- 
ever, no such difficulty of choice in vot- 
ing for congressmen and the issues will 
often be clear-cut and the Negro vote 
of large importance. 

In the Middle West, out of a total 
of 7,000,000 votes, the Negro should 
have at least 350,000, or 5 per cent. 
Wisely used, this means the balance of 
power, not only in the Presidential 
Election but in the election of congress- 
men; because the fight in the Middle 
West over the issues of liquor, Catho- 
licism, the farmer, labor and industry, 
is going to be fierce. 

The farm issue will, of course, be 
emphasized in Iowa, Missouri, Ne- 
braska and Kansas. Here again the

Negro will have 7 per cent of the vote 
and he ought to use every ounce of his 
power to the greatest advantage. 

The Southern Border States present, 
of course, the usual anomaly. In Dela- 
ware, Maryland, West Virginia, Ken- 
tucky and Tennessee, out of a vote of 
about 2,225,000, Negroes should cast 
25 per cent. This is enough to control 
the election; but the Negro vote in 
these states has for a long time been 
shamelessly manipulated. There is not 
only open bribery and economic intimi- 
dation, but there is the prevailing prob- 
lem of what the Negro can cast his 
vote for if he bolts the Republican 
Party. He dare not vote for the Demo- 
crats when the Democrats act as they 
have recently in Tennessee and he can 
hardly with self-respect vote with the 
Republicans of Kentucky. Certainly in 
Delaware and Maryland the Negro can 
afford to vote for the local Democratic 
Ticket in many cases. The results of 
doing this in the past have proven its 
wisdom ; but it is worth careful thought 
and prolonged negotiation. 

All things considered in the election 
of 1928, the Negro voter has the great- 
est chance for intelligent and purpose- 
ful independence than has come to him 
in a generation. 

(In future numbers we shall discuss: 
the effect of disfranchisement in the 
South; the presidential candidates; the 
congressional candidates and the issues 
at stake in the campaign.) 


THE FOURTEENTH SPIN- 
GARN MEDAL 


HE Fourteenth Spingarn Medal 

has been awarded to Charles 
Waddell Chesnutt of Cleveland, Ohio, 
“In recognition of his pioneer work 
as literary artist depicting the life and 
struggle of Americans of Negro de- 
scent, and for his long and useful 
career as scholar, worker and free- 
man of one of America’s greatest 
cities”. 

The Spingarn Medal was established 
by Joel E. Spingarn in 1914 and is 
awarded annually “for the highest or 
noblest achievement by an American 
Negro during the proceeding year or 
years”. 

It is no easy task to interpret and 
carry out the spirit of this distinguished 
award. If the Committee should em- 
phasize the achievement of a single 
year they would be in grave danger 
of rewarding an exceptional and acci- 
dental deed, popular and notable at the 
time, but of no lasting importance and 
giving no real indication of character 
end ability. On the other hand, if the 
Committee should establish the cus- 
tom of awarding this medal simply 
for the rounding out of a long and 
honorable career, it would again miss 


276 


the real object which is to herald dis- 
tinguished accomplishment, rather than 
desert or length of days. 

In awarding this medal to Mr. Ches- 
nutt this year, the Committee has had 
in mind a singular fact: it is not simply 
true that Mr. Chesnutt has done dis- 
tinguished work in past years, but it 
is singularly true that that work today 
and this year is being recognized as 
of prime importance in the renaissance 
of American Negro literature. Perhaps 
no single man could be picked out who 
is more worthy to be called the Dean 
of the young black artists who are 
writing today. This was one reason 
for the award, and in addition, the 
Committee had in mind Mr. Ches- 
nutt’s personality, his artistic detach- 
ment, his humor and good-nature, the 
high regard in which he is held by his 
fellow citizens of Cleveland, white and 
black, his interest in every civic move- 
ment, which makes for the betterment 
of men. For these reasons it seems 
to THe Crisis that the Spingarn 
Medal has seldom, if ever, been more 
fittingly awarded. 


THE CONFERENCE 


T may seem overstatement when we 

say from year to year that each Con- 
ference of the N. A. A. C. P. overtops 
the last. It is, of course, impossible 
that each Conference should surpass 
the others in every respect. But in 
certain ways every succeeding Con- 
ference sets a new mark: there was 
the great mass meeting of 10,000 at 
Indianapolis; the Spingarn Medal 
night at Chicago; and the Academy 
of Music meeting at Philadelphia. 

But Los Angeles rose to new heights 
—the reception at the decorated depot; 
the lovely blue and gold of the weather 
with blossoming flower and fruit; the 
presence of public officials of city and 
state; the throwing open of 22 leading 
churches to our speakers; the great 
meeting at the Shrine and Philhar- 
monic and above all—the Hotel, 
Somerville! Never before in the his- 
tory of black America has so beautiful 
and complete a hostelry, owned and 
conducted by black folk, been opened, 
equipped and presented to the world 
in six months for a great national con- 
vention. There is nothing like it in the 
United States among our people and 
white hotels surpass it only in size. 


PHOTOGRAPHS 


N this year’s grand commencement 

procession of Negro graduates of col- 
leges, we have the remarkable total of 
1617 men and women. It would be 
a delightful privilege for us to publish 
all of their photographs, but such an 
undertaking would not be practical 


even if we devoted every square inch of 
our thirty-six page magazine to Photo- 
graphs. Consequently we are publish. 
ing only the following photographs:

On this account we extend our sin- 
cere congratulation to all persons re- 
ceiving the Bachelor’s degree and pro- 
fessional degrees in ordinary course and 
to all high school graduates, and ask 
their pardon for omitting their. pictures, 


MANNING 


OSEPH C. MANNING iis a very 

sick man. Colored people should 
remember him. He is a white man 
from Alabama who represents the in- 
surgent South—those who do not be- 
lieve that all political activity begins 
and ends in the South. He was among 
those who tried triumphantly, twenty- 
five years ago, to establish popularism 
in Alabama, in Arkansas and in Texas. 
If there had been a Republican form 
of government in those states, the 
Third Party movement would have 
triumphed. But although triumphing 
at the polls, the white men were 
counted out by the same methods in 
use against Negroes, and the South 
sank to those present conditions of poli- 
tical lethargy. Those who want to 
hear a part of the story of this move- 
ment should read Mr. Manning’s book, 
“The Fade-Out of Popularism”. 


PROPAGANDA IN THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 


ACE prejudice is easily made in- 

distinctive in the Barrington High 
School, New York City. The teacher 
in a history class talked about John 
Brown, It was a shame that he was 
called a martyr. She could not under- 
stand how anyone could regard him as 
aught but a riotous law breaker. 

In a Flushing High School the 
teacher announced that there were no 
Negro soldiers in the Civil War. One 
colored boy ventured to remind her 
that there were 200,000. He was told 
that it was not so. 

In a Queens Grammar. School, the 
teacher had never heard of Frederick 
Douglass, but she allowed a colored 
student to write. an essay on it, and 
was rather astonished at what she 
learned.

bers of the colored race. In fact, some 
of them have been very popular in col. 
lege—one I especially remember who 
was a member of our baseball team and 
was liked by everybody. The two boys 
in college I find on intimate terms with 
their fellows.” 


Wellesley adds this: 


“We are, of course, very careful to 
avoid dormitory complications by giving 
these students single rooms. We are also 
careful in assigning to tables to avoid 
anything which would make an unhappy 
situation for these students, since, as you 
know, some southern girls might object, 
It has happened more than once that 
either a member of the faculty or a sen- 
ior in charge of a table in a college 
dormitory has asked that a certain Ne- 
gro student be assigned to her table.” 


Cornell makes no official declaration 
but a colored student there writes as 
follows: 


“There is no law preventing race stu- 
dents from entering the Cornell Medical 
School in New York, but it is an ex- 
tremely difficult proposition for them to 
matriculate there; and Negro women 
students are not prohibited from living in 
the girls’ dormitories, but it is always 
impossible for them to secure a room in 
the same as it is claimed that their appli- 
cations have not been filed early enough. 
They are usuaily grouped together with 
a Negro family and where they have 
been placed for the last few years has 
worked many hardships upon them be- 
cause they are at a great distance from 
the University, and during the winter 
when deep snows prevail the trolley ser- 
vice becomes disrupted thereby making it 
necessary for them to plod many miles 
through intense cold and heavy snows.” 


ANY institutions are doing se- 
cretly what Butler University 
has done openly. That is, admit only 
a certain number or proportion of col- 
ored students. Butler writes: 
“We admit ten Negro students each 
year on the basis of scholarship and 
character.” 


Kansas State Agricultural College: 

“Our policy toward Negro students 
has always been to give them the benefit 
of the best that we have in class room 
instruction, and opportunity to develop 
to the best of their ability. The training 
which they receive here enables them to 
go out and do a really serviceable work 
among their own people, and to assume 
positions of leadership. We shall con- 
tinue along these lines.”

garn Medal night was Tuesday, July 
3. Miss Ethelwyn Mills spoke of 
peace: 

+ “The white man arrogantly pushes his 
way through the Orient and the yellow 
peoples in turn are learning the white 
man’s way of violence and hurl at him 
their distrust. We seem to stand only a 
step or two away from gigantic war, 
which might easily involve the whole 
world in unimaginable terror and mis- 
ery. 

The Lieutenant Governor of the 
state presented the Spingarn Medal to 
Charles W. Chesnutt and Mr. Ches- 
nutt responded. Harry Davis closed 
the session with a spirited defense of 
reconstruction. 

“During the entire period only 33 col- 
ored men were seated in the national con- 
gress and one-half of these were college 
men. In one senatorial campaign the 
Charleston News and Courier urged the 
election of Robert Brown Elliott, an Ox- 
ford man, over a northern carpet bag- 
ger and a southern demagogue. It has 
been aptly pointed out that a majority 
of these men had received more scholas- 
tic training than a recent President of 
the United States. In state and local 
administrative office a fair number of 
colored men served with such conspicu- 
ous ability as to gain the respect of 
southern whites.

WASHINGTON, B. 6 














“ ite of inexperience and in spite 
of ot al of the technique of govern- 
ment, handicaps which have wrecked far 
abler officials, the Negro gave to the 
South in a few short years the funda- 
mentals of American democracy. — He 
wrote into the organic law provisions 
for a free ballot and free public schools. 
He reformed the judicial and penal code 
and made the beginnings of state institu- 
tions for the care of the unfortunate. 
He even made free labor and wages re- 
spectable. Some day history will cor- 
rectly appraise the Negro’s first oppor- 
tunity and effort and some day even a 
grudging South will admit the merit of 
these outstanding accomplishments—a 
program of achievements worthy of the 
highest praise in any democratic govern- 
ment. 

“Today we observe an appreciable ten- 
dency toward the restoration of the Ne- 
gro in public life. He is gradually se- 
curing not a dominating, but a repre- 
sentative place in public service.” 

The address to the country, drawn 
up by the committee of which Dr. W. 
E. B. Du Bois was Chairman, was as 
follows : 


“The year of the Presidential Election 
brings forcibly to the mind of every 
American, white and black, the insistent 
problem of Democratic Government in 
the United States. The National Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Colored 
People in its 19th Annual Conference 
reiterates its charge that the disfrancise- 
ment of the majority of intelligent adult 
Negroes in the United States is not sim- 
ply a race problem, it is a problem of 
Democracy and it affects the entire na- 
tion and the whole world. 

If Democracy is discredited and sneer- 
ed at today, it is very largely because 
of its partial failure in the United 
States. We are today dominated openly 
by selfish private interests, rather than 
by free and intelligent public opinion; 
and this is in no small measure because 
the disfranchisement of 3,750,000 black 
voters in the South has involved the dis- 
franchisement of more than 5 million 
Southern white voters. Despite an in- 
crease of 100 per cent in the voting popu- 
lation of 11 Southern states, and despite 
the 1%h Amendment, we face the as- 
tonishing fact that in the last forty years 
the voting population there has increased 

y 50 per cent and in the Southern 
South, there has been practically no in- 
crease in the number of voters in a gen- 
eration. 

These facts, together with the dis- 
franchisement of the foreign-born in 
New England, and the gerrymandering 
of congressional districts elsewhere, give 

astonishing result that a million vot-

VERY Negro in America has a tremendous 
stake in guarding this Citadel over which the 
National Benefit stands sentinel. The lives of 

our children and our children’s children—for genera- 
tions yet unborn—these too are vitally concerned in 
the manner of its guardianship. For the citadel is the 
Citadel of Negro Commercial Progress, and in its 
protection and strengthening lies our hope as a Race 
to obtain for ourselves—and those to follow us— 
the splendor of Equal Opportunity and Higher 
Standards of Living and Attainment. 


Against all invaders, over nearly three decades of 
years, the National Benefit has held every breach, 


repelled every attack, kept intact this stronghold of 
the Race. 


As the largest and strongest Negro enterprise—as 
the greatest Negro financial institution on earth— 
the post is ours by right as well as by choice. 


Stand with us—do business with Negro enterprises— 
insure in Negro companies—their future is the fu- 
ture of the Race.

Thus, Democratic Government in the 
United States has become a farce, pri- 
marily because for the sake of disfran- 
chising black men, white America has 
been willing to distranchise itself. 

The National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People in this 
year of the Presidential Election calls on 
the nation for a new faith in Democracy 
without regard to race or color. The 
American ballot must be re-established 
on a real basis of intelligence and char- 
acter. Only in such way <an this nation 
face the tremendous problems before it: 
the problem of free speech, an unsub- 
sidized press, and civil liberty for all 
people; the problem of imperialism and 
the emancipation of Haiti, Nicaragua, 
Cuba, the Philippines and Hawaii from 
the Government of American Banks; the 
overshadowing problem of peace among 
the nations and of decent and intelligent 
cooperation in the real advancement of 
the natives of Africa and Asia, together 
with freedom for China, India and 
Egypt. 

If we need the power of intelligent 
democracy for these broader matters, we 
need it all the more here in our own 
land and for the specific hurts of the 
population that this Association espe- 
cially represents. 

For the first time in a generation there 
has passed in the United States one 
period of one hundred and twenty days 
when a human being has not been lynched 
by a mob. The gratification of record- 
ing such a fact only increases the sense 
of utter shame that a great modern na- 
tion must needs rejoice at so elementary 
an exhibition of decency. If lynching can 
be stopped for four months, it can be 
stopped for four years. If it can be les- 
sened by local initiative, it can and should 
be wiped out by national enactment. It 
is clear from seven recent mob murders 
that lynching still needs to be stopped. A 
Federal Anti-Lynching Law should write 
into the statutes of the nation the deter- 
mination of America to put down mob 
rule. 

Disfrancisement and segregation, race 
hatred and war, all are steps toward the 
same degeneracy. We have driven ofh- 
cial residential segregation out from the 
protection of the law; but it continues 
to be common in real estate manipula- 
tion and by voluntary agreement. Segre- 
gation by race of American citizens is 
still practiced and persisted in the de- 
partments of the Federal Government at 
Washington. It is due to our unremit- 
ting effort that this open defiance of the 
constitution is less general. Whatever 
political power we have, should be used 
to continue the fight until no vestige of 
this abuse remains.

THE CRISIS, 
69 Fifth Avenue 


282 


New York City 

















In the past, racial discrimination in the 
United States has been repeatedly ex- 
cused on account of the ignorance of the 
descendants of the slaves, despite the fact 
that this ignorance was once notoriously 
made compulsory by law. Even today 
with the tremendous advance which 
black Americans have made in intelli- 
gence, their means of education are de- 
plorably limited. In the chief centers of 
Negro population there is open discrimi- 
nation in the salaries of teachers, length 
of school terms, provision of housing and 
equipment, and amount of money spent 
on white and Negro public schools. 


A recent document published in the 
Congressional Record shows that the 
states which have separate. schools for 
Negroes have only 3,000 college students, 
where they ought to have 37,000 and re- 
ceive only $2,300,000 a year from State 
and National funds, when they ought to 
receive twelve millions. This is illegal 
and unconstitutional and socially suicidal. 
It must be remedied and we must remedy 
it by every means in our power and 
especially by ballots and by court action. 


Our economic situation is still pre- 
carious and deplorable. We have more 
difficulty than white folk in securing de- 
cent work and we are paid less for the 
same jobs. We denounce the secret en- 
mity toward black workers which is still 
manifested by those American trade 
unions which acquiesce in discrimination 
toward them and in opposition to their 
membership and employment. We should 
refuse to use our political power to ad- 
vance the cause of white unionism when 
it stands for color discrimination. We 
rejoice at the continued growth and de- 
velopment of Negro culture, art and 
literature. Despite efforts within and 
without the race to prostitute beauty 
to filth and defeatism, we are still 
objects of petty public insult, coupled 
with economic theft. In time of public 
calamity, like the Mississippi flood, we 
are treated in many instances like slaves 
and criminals. We still lack the right 
to enter many places of public accom- 
modation, and especially we continue 
to pay railroads in the South for accom- 
modations which we do not receive. 
These public carriers, even in interstate 
trafic, enforce a species of discrimination 
$0 Outrageous and so obviously illegal as 
to call for immediate redress before the 
courts. Our great weapon of offense 
against all this is the ballot. We must 
not give it up. We must register and 
vote whenever and wherever we can. 
We must not mortgage our vote to faith- 

and corrupt political organizations. 
we must demand in return for our po- 
litical allegiance, education, decent home 
surroundings, public protection and na- 
tional respect. Behind that ballot and 
ghting for it stands the National Asso- 
Cation for the Advancement of Colored 
©. No American, black or white, 
does his full duty who does not support 
Its policies and its work. 

We hail and greet our friends, North 

and South, black and white, whose liberal 
t in word and deed, in platform, 

et classroom, book and press, is 
twarding the day of our complete 
¢Mancipation.”

Our Negro “Intellectuals” 
(Continued from page 269) 


which is the other side of life are the 
qualifications of the critic. Our Negro 
“intellectuals” have tried to substitute 
a display of their own and the race’s 
eccentricities for these virtues, Mr, 
Schuyler and Mr. Gordon are likely 
to become the forerunners of a line of 
young critics, who will pose as the 
thoughtful and emancipated Negro, 
They will pretend to represent a Posi- 
tivistic and experimental attitude to. 
ward the Negro’s situation, to replace 
the religious fatalism and inferiority 
complex of our older leaders. It js 
precisely this specious liberalism in our 
little Menchenites, which makes them 
dangerous. The Negro to-day is at q 
critical and strategic point of transi- 
tion, where the cry of intellectual 
emancipation will lead him after false 
lights, unless he is willing to be thor- 
oughly critical. We must avoid the re 
current, human tendency to exchange 
one extreme for another. Complete 
trust of all that parades as intelligence, 
and an effort to be hypercritical are not 
the proper cure for an inferiority com- 
plex. Smartness and a superficial cyni- 


cism are not substitutes for reflection 
and vision. 


R. SCHUYLER and Mr. Gor- 

don are interested only in ex- 
pressing themselves, their cleverness 
without taste, their radicalism with- 
out intelligence, their contempt for 
Negro leaders and our upper class, un- 
informed by serious principles. The 
most obvious fact concerning Mr. 
Schuyler’s articles is their coarse flip- 
pancy which he no doubt means to be 
a protective hardening for the sensi- 
tiveness and race-consciousness of Ne- 
groes. But to become hardened to 
such terms as “smoke”, “Ziggaboo”, 
“crow”, “dinge”, “shine”, or to take 
refuge in thumbing one’s nose by hutl- 
ing back “cracker”, “peckerwood”, and 
“hill-billy”, is not to gain  stoical 
strength, but to lose self-respect. The 
qualities which have kept the Negro’s 
spirit unbroken are a gift for irony of 
a broader kind, and an everlasting for- 
titude. 

Reflection and contemplation, alone, 
can insure the critic’s virtues of per- 
spective and balance. Reflection Is 
made evident by one’s discrimination, 
one’s power of making vital distinc 
tions. What Mr. Schuyler, Mr. Gor 
don, and their school, as well as Mr. 
Mencken, lack, is just this faculty of 
discriminating judgment. Mr. Schuy- 
ler especially reveals his lack of all 
standards in his frivolous and univer 
sal cynicism. In his indiscriminate

iE Crisis 


‘eeri t all efforts to ameliorate 
ee animosity and injustice, and at 
the efforts of such men as “Dr. Lamp- 
black of the Federal Society for the 
Exploitation of Lynching, who will 
eloquently hold forth for the better 
part of an hour on the blackamoor’s 
gifts to the Great Republic, and why, 
therefore, he should not be kept down , 
Mr. Schuyler betrays his own intellec- 
tual muddle. 


R. GORDON’S innocence of 
M any standards and his intellec- 
tual confusion are illustrated by his 
naive theory that the tradition which 
the Negro wants to preserve is that of 
the black-face minstrel and the Stephen 
Foster folk. THE NEGRO’S IN- 
HIBITIONS, so far as it is at all 
honest and serious, is an unconscious 
reductio ad absurdum of the primitivis- 
tic creed. The Negro is to treasure 
his eccentricities simply because they 
are spontaneous and differentiate him 
from the white man! If Mr. Gordon 
had any real perception he would have 
found ideals based upon the character 
of the Negro which distinguish him 
from the white man in a more funda- 
mental sense. The qualities which have 
moulded the Negro are not emotional 
crudeness and colorful spontaneity ; they 
are fortitude, an oriental spirituality 
and unworldliness, and a faculty of 
laughing at any tendency towards self- 
pity, which more than anything human 
approaches the laughter of Mr. 
O’Neil’s Lazarus! 


ITHOUT intelligent standards, 
then, our Menckenites still in- 

sist upon expressing themselves. What 
they really set up for our improvement, 
in the place of standards, is their own 
personality. The virtue of their writ- 
ing they believe to lie in the brilliance 
and iconoclastic smartness with which 
they demolish what is obviously ignor- 
ant and mean. Every man or move- 
ment treated is warped and caricatured 
by the necessity for displaying their 
own temperament. Mr. Schuyler ex- 
presses his fantastic misconception of 
the affluence recently acquired by Ne- 
gro writers, in this fashion: “the black 
scribblers, along with the race orators, 
are now wallowing in the luxury of 
four-room apartments, expensive radios, 
Chickering pianos, Bond Street habili- 
ments, canvas-back duck, pre-war 
tch, and high yallow mistresses”. 
And Mr. Schuyler is “wallowing” in 
his own temperament! Similarly Mr. 
tdon’s representation that most Ne- 
groes are blind apes of everything in 
the white world is only a reflection of 
his individual desire to pose before the 
te public. So long as we have had 
Tomantic confessionalists, we have been 
acquainted with those who desire “to 
publish themselves”, in Emerson’s

phrase; but when they set themselves 
up as serious critics, they become pub- 
lic dangers. 


Ill 

UR “intellectuals”, then, both 

those in literature and those in 
race criticism, have capitalized the sen- 
sational aspects of Negro life, at the 
expense of general truth and sound 
judgment. Primitivism has carried the 
imagination of our poets and story- 
tellers into the unhealthy and abnor- 
mal. A sterile cynicism has driven our 
Menckenized critics into smart coarse- 
ness. With regard to the primitivists, 
the first thing to be settled is whether 
our lives are to be interpreted with 
relation to the Negro race or the hu- 
man race. Are there any traits pecul- 
iar to Negro character, and if so, are 
those traits especially crude emotions? 
It will appear, I think, that the quali- 
ties of fortitude, irony, and a relative 
absence of self-pity are the most im- 
portant influences in the lives of Ne- 
groes, and that these qualities are the 
secret strength of that part of us which 
is one with a universal human nature. 
Our poets and writers of fiction have 
failed to interpret this broader human 
nature in Negroes, and found it rela- 
tively easy to disguise their lack of a 
higher imagination by concentrating 
upon immediate and crude emotions. 


UR critic “intellectuals” also lack 

this quality of elevation. Mr. 
Schuyler, Mr. Gordon, and their imi- 
tators, (at two removes from Mr. 
Mencken!) are preoccupied with the 
sordid and trivial aspects of Negro 
life. On the whole, the facts of Negro 
life are sordid; they have been so for 
three hundred years, as a result of 
slavery, and will very likely remain so 
for sometime to come. We are going 
on our grit, and it is these higher secret 
powers which I have indicated, (call 
them spiritual or chemical, as you like) 
which we must preserve and apply in- 
telligently to our future development. 
Self-respect is vital if we are to retain 
our courage, and self-respect is pre- 
cisely the quality which these critics 
lack. “Such conceits as clownage keeps 
in pay” are their qualifications, and the 
Negro has had enough clowning,— 
from his leaders down. I have already 
defined the true critic as the individual 
who holds fast to his perception of 
what is excellent and real, in the midst 
of appearances, and who applies his 
standards with discrimination to the 
flux of actual life. The genuinely qual- 
ified crtics of Negro life will fix upon 
the inner strength of Negro character 
as illustrated in the last three hundred 
years, and, discounting the trivial and 
irrelevant, will reinterpret these per- 
sistent characteristics for the new Ne- 
gro to whom he will be as an eye.
