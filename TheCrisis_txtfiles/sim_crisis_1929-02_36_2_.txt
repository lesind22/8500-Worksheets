Gentlemen: 


On August 31, 1928, I was painfully hurt. It did not occur to me 
that I was a member of the Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc., until I re- 
ceived a request from my agent in Portsmouth, Va., to send in my sick 
card. The check for my benefits came forthwith, and assurance that 
they would continue until I was able to work again, and they have. 


I did not seek the company after being hurt, but it sought me 400 
miles away to be sure that I was cared for. Is it a friend? Is it true to its 
contracts? I say cheerfully, it is, and I most cheerfully recommend the 
Southern Aid Society of Va., Inc. to all of my race everywhere.

OUR ADVICE FOR 1929 IS: 
BUY MORE LIFE INSURANCE 


Unlike some other great men, we have not been asked to contribute our prophecy on condi- 
tions in 1929. We give it any way, and pay for space to have it printed. 


The American People should buy more Life Insurance in 1929 than ever before. Especially 
should colored Americans, because we need it more; we understand more about its uses each 
year, and there are more of us with money to pay for it each year. 


Our interest in this subject is not entirely academic. Buy more Life Insurance because we have it to sell. Our 
business increased more than fifty per cent. in 1928. If it increased several thousand per cent, in 1929, we 
would not then have supplied all the Life Insurance that colored Americans need, and can pay for. Hundreds 
of our policyholders have reached their limit with us now. We urge them to continue to buy more; to add to 
their insurance policies from any reputable company that will supply their needs; especially from the legal 
reserve life insurance companies, owned and managed by colored people. 


The man or woman who buys more life insurance is the one who has already bought from us or from some 
other company. Such a person can better understand the idea of adding to, of accumulating something worth 
while for himself and for a generation that must have financial resources far in excess of our own. Our policies 
are good but they are not offered as substitutes for the policies of any other company. We-try to give our policy- 
holders something they never had before. Any one of the twelve thousand can tell you what that is. We can tell 
you if you mail us the attached coupon. An attractive calendar goes with the telling—without obligation to you. 


In 1929 Buy More Life Insurance

HE CROW, looking at the year 

of Grace, 1928 in reminiscent 
mood, notes a few facts.—The United 
States has proposed a treaty with 
twenty-nine nations, abandoning War 
as a national policy. As a result, no 
armies have been reduced and _ all 
navies will be enlarged.—The United 
States was the first to recognize new 
China.—Bolivia and Paraguay do not 
want to fight but are not sure how they 
can help it with the present world 
about them.—President Coolidge re- 
fuses to make Porto Rico either slave 
or free—The McNary-Haugen Farm 
Relief Bill is again vetoed by the Pres- 
ident—The 70th Congress appropri- 
ated $4,628,045,035—Mr. Samuel 
Insull’s personal representative has 
entered the President’s Cabinet, which 
seems reasonable—Mr. William F. 
Whiting succeeds Herbert Hoover as 
Secretary of Commerce, and Herbert 
Hoover will succeed Calvin Coolidge 
as President of the United States.— 
The Jingoes want fifteen new cruisers. 
—The Boulder Dam bill for power 
and flood control of the Colorado 
River is signed.—The Jones Bill to 
appropriate 325 million to control the 
Mississippi floods is passed, without

Powder directed the Smith campaign. 
All the other corporations joined 
Hoover.—President-elect Hoover took 
a trip to South America to see if there

Gambling in stocks on Wall Street

added two, burning one alive; making 
eleven in all.—A revised prayer book

A Pilgrimage To The Negro Schools 


By W. E. BURGHARDT Du BOIS 


HESE are snapshots, and _ they 

have the validity and weakness of 
snapshots. 1 got mere glimpses of 
these various institutions, and from 
the glimpses came impressions and 
judgments. In some cases these im- 
pressions are doubtless right, in others, 
just as surely they are quite wrong. 
I give them, therefore, not as final 
judgments, but simply for what 
they are worth, and | shall be glad to 
know of any mistakes | may have 
made. 


PALMER AND PETERSBURG 


HE Palmer Institute at Sedalia 
¥ has a distinct individuality and a 
certain little air of culture. ‘There is 
yim and enthusiasm, sunlight and air. 
Perhaps the institution feels a bit new 
and self-conscious and over-eager, and 
yet it is genuine. It has buildings, 
good-class rooms, and a teachers’ home 
that is homelike. It needs a library. 


I am confirmed in my feeling that 
the Virginia Normal and Collegiate 
Institute at Petersburg is a well-run 


February , 1929 


institution. It has, for instance, one 
of the best school libraries that I know: 
a library that is not a miscellaneous 
collection of old books, but a new thing 
planned and bought for use and used. 
It is building the most complete set of 
student dormitories that I saw in my 
journey. And what it needs, as so 
many institutions need, is some method 
of getting rid of buildings already 
there. 

What shall one do with an old 
building? The great central hall at 
Petersburg is a monstrosity. It ought 
to be sunk into a deep hole and covered 
up. A general destruction at Shaw 
would be an improvement. Johnson 
Smith could spare a couple of buildings, 
and so can Allen at Columbia. Be- 
thune-Cookman, Waters, Haines, At- 
lanta and Fisk have all one or two or 
more buildings that need to be burned. 


But to go back to Petersburg. It 
moves like clockwork. The curricu- 
lum is complete and all-embracing in 
its theory, and yet, do I not seem to 
feel a little too much machinery, a 
certain lack of spontaneity and initia- 


Sisters Chapel, Spelman College 


tive on the part of the students? The 
student audience did not have the 
same air of intelligence that I found 
in many other places. 


SHAW AND FAYETTEVILLE 


HAW is grey-haired and slow. But 

it has a constituency. It is built 
deep in human hearts. It needs, physi- 
cally and mentally, without doubt, 
thorough overhauling and _ re-adjust- 
ment to a new day. 


The State Normal School at Fay- 
etteville was a discovery. It has one 
beautiful building. Not many Negro 
institutions have beautiful buildings. 
As I| think back, I can see the crowning 
mass of the dining hall at Tuskegee. 
One does not easily forget it. The 
new quadrangle at Spelman is a fine 
thing and Talladega has the best and 
most beautiful group 
without ostentation, of any of the 
Southern institutions. But the dining 
hall at Fayetteville is one of the most 
beautiful buildings of the 
South.

Fayetteville is a curious mass of con- 
tradictions. It has some good dormi- 
tories, with a young, live faculty, and 
I have never spoken to a student audi- 
ence that showed more rapt attention 
and intelligence; and yet, on the top 
of that came one astonishing adven- 
ture: Fayetteville is difficult of access, 
and I asked the Principal to arrange to 
get me to Hamlet by auto sixty miles 


away. He promised to hire one, but 
could not. Nevertheless, it mattered 
little. The roads were excellent and 


the Principal himself owns two autos: 
a Cadillac and a new Ford. He sent 
his chauffeur with me and we made the 
trip in an hour and a half, with an 
expenditure of less than three gallons 
of gas, and the Principal charged me 
Ten Dollars for the courtesy! The 
next time 1 go to Fayetteville I shall 
walk. 


SMITH, ALLEN AND 
BETHUNE 
OHNSON C. SMITH is sedate 


and staid. It has a quiet, clean 
campus and an air of academic with- 
drawal. ‘The students are a crowd of 
sturdy big-voiced boys and they lis- 
tened with intelligence and even eager- 
ness. But the school has too much 
religion and too few.young modern 
teachers. It lacks something of fire 
and vim, of freedom and aspiration. 
There were roses in my room. 

Allen, at Columbia, had again an 
unusually intelligent and attentive 
audience. It occupies a whole city 
square, with many good-looking build- 
ings. Four modest and rather pretty 
girls sang Negro folk songs. But they 
sang them with quavers, and_ half- 
tones, and succeeded in taking every 
shred of melody, even out of “Steal 
Away”. 

I spent a Saturday off at Jackson- 
ville with Colonel Floyd, but that # 
another story and a long one. With 
him I rode down the beach to Day- 
tona, a magnificent flight between the 
ocean and the air. 

Bethune-Cookman, is a_ institution 
one does not easily forget. It is on 
exhibition and numbers of tourists pour 
#n to see it of a Sunday. I was dis- 
tressed to find my student audience 
behind me singing, instead of in front 
of me listening. I think next time I 
shall turn my back to the audience. 
But the institution has been built and 
planned by the indominable energy of 
one black woman and her enthusiastic 
spirit inspires it and makes it live. The 
students are unexpectedly alive. I 
talked with those in the Junior Col- 
lege, all alone and cosily sequestered 
in the Principal’s parlor with no teach- 
ers there. Goodness! but they walked 
into things. There were no hesitations 


44 


































or reticences. They started right out 
with social equality, racial intermar- 
riage, companionate marriage, the sex 
morality of the younger generation, 
occupations, and so on. It was a 
breathless living hour, and quite worth 
going to Florida for. 


I come back again to the extraordi- 
nary vitality and eagerness, the curios- 
ity and intellectual freedom of these 
new colored students. It is beyond 
that of the white students that I have

been talking to in numbers of North- 
ern institutions. And I presume it is 
more vital because it reflects a freedom 
but very recently gained and not yet 
quite recognized. Some of the teach- 
ers rather look to me like hens with 
ducklings and I am sure that teachers 
and principals were several times on 
the edge of apology when | hurried to 
forstall them by some remark. As 
compared with the colored student 
body which I knew and bullied as a 
teacher and which I have seen in vague 
glimpses during the last twenty years, 
I should say that since 1920 intellectual 





revolution had struck the colored gol. 
lege student ; and trustees and teachers 
had better yield gracefully. Indeed 
this is what they show many signs of 
doing. 


WATERS AND CHARLESTON 


RODE back from Daytona with 

the President of Edward Waters 
and stopped at Jacksonville to lecture 
for this college. Edward Waters is an 


A. M. E. School and it is down at 


the heels. It has one good building, 
and that characteristically, is a build- 
ing for theological students who are 
not there. Yet the African A. M. E. 
Church in Florida is vigorous and well- 
organized. ‘The school has valuable 
land, although the titles are clouded 
by failure to pay taxes. The student 
body looks dull and unintelligent. Vig- 
orous organization is needed here to 
save their institution. 

Charleston is always Charleston, 
with its Mona Lisa smile, and_ its 
hereditary hospitality. I go there to

“Jazzin God” 


By GEORGE W. CRAWFORD 


T is night. My errand brings me 

through a busy street of the Negro 
section in a city having a colored pop- 
ulation of seven thousand. Suddenly 
[ am arrested by bedlam which pro- 
ceeds from the open transom of a store 
front whose show windows are smeared 
to intransparency. What issues forth is 
conglomeration itself—a syncopated 
rhythmic mess of tune accompanied by 
strumming guitars and jingling tam- 
hourines and frequently punctuated 
by wild shrieks and stamping feet. 
Above the din occasionally emerge 
such words as “Jesus”, “God”, “Hal- 
lelujah”, “Glory”, and then I realize 
that this frenzy is being perpetrated in 
the name of religion. A young man 
of my own race who has stopped in 
amazement turns to. me_half-quizz- 
ically and says, “What do you know 
about that? Jazzin’ God”. 

The sharp pertinency of this shrewd 
observation remains with me. In the 
same block there are four other sim- 
ilar Temples to Hysteria. The Busi- 
ness has been standardized. First you 
have a Negro man either too lazy to 
work or else resolved to live by his 
wits. He starts a “chuch”. A new 
and bombastic title is found to differ- 
entiate the enterprise from the ortho- 
dox sects. The ‘“‘prophet” (he is al- 
ways a prophet) then begins the re- 
cruiting of his flock. It is no guess 
work; the requirements are accurately 
known. It takes a minimum of twelve 
washer women to pay the overhead and 
provide the prophet’s meal ticket. En- 
listments beyond that number are so 
much “velvet”. ‘Then the most avail- 
able store, usually a drug upon the 
rental market, is found, and here is 
housed ““The Saints of the Ever Liv- 
ing God”, “The Never Dies”, ‘The 
Sanctified”, or any other of the “fifty- 
seven” varieties of the titles usually hit

upon to designate those who have been 
peculiarly set apart from the Chris- 
tians who organize in the conventional 
way. One fine day, however, the 
smear is washed off, and the ‘For 
Rent” sign goes back on the door. The 
infinite variety of the “prophet” has 
become stale, and so he has departed 
to new and unconquered fields. His 
flock has dispersed until the coming of 
another “prophet” with a more in- 
triguing line of “bunk” and a new and 
different brand of “gravy”. 


T is a Sunday morning. In the 

most congested Negro center in the 
world, I set out to find a place of 
worship. My quest does not take me 
far when I stand before a wonderful 
pile of stones. The sign tells me it is 
a Negro Church. Later information 
reveals that the edifice was built by and 
for white followers of Jesus, but that 
it was abandoned in the face of a Ne- 
gro invasion, and then unloaded for 
its weight in gold upon a Negro con- 
gregation. I enter and with great 
pomp am ushered to a handsome pew. 
The entire appointments are gorgeous, 
and would befit a group of Wall 
Street capitalists. The organ alone 
surely cost twenty-five thousand dol- 
lars. And then an imposing figure of a 
man ascends the dais—pulpit would 
be misnomer in view of what takes 
place. His air is imperious. He ex- 
udes authority. He is both cynosure 
and magnet. After certain prelimi- 
naries deemed necessary to create the 
proper atmosphere, the preacher comes 
to the front in the manner of an actor 
who is about to put on the star feature 
of the performance. That which is 
committed in the name of the ‘‘sermon’”’ 
turns out to be a bag of verbal tricks 
in the hands of a master of mob

psychology. The text chosen and 
solemnly announced, is a mere excuse, 
for it has not the slightest relevancy 
to what follows. A fervid recital of 
an outstanding Biblical incident; a 
florid picture of the elect at God’s 
right hand, gloating over the lot of the 
damned; a final and devastating emo- 
tional sweep which carries before it 
all the sanity left in the house; a 
frenzy which continues until spent in 
the utter exhaustion of the worship- 
ers. 


The calm that eventually arrives 
finds the stage set for the next act. A 
dapper band of go-getters prance up to 
several tables at the front, and crack 
jokes and “lift” the collection which 
amounts to a princely sum for a group 
of working folk. Now comes the more 
prosaic business of projecting the 
schedule for the following week: meet- 
ings of a dozen auxiliaries are to be 
held ; a chiterling supper is to be served 
—all addressed to the staggering bur- 
den of the church debt; a midweek 
prayer meeting will convene at which 
the saints will foregather and con- 
gratulate each other that their respec- 
tive souls are saved. I listen in vain 
for the suggestion of a single activity 
having to do with the problems of the 
lives which these people will live until 
the next Sunday. Not one word. The 
gospel promulgated here has no social 
implications. The religion housed in 
this building begins and ends with a 
trickle down the spine. It is now two 
solid hours since I entered the door. 
A stentorian announcement comes from 
the chief actor that we will all rise 
and sing the Doxology. I mentally add 
the famous admonition of Bert Wil- 
liams to ‘“‘use of all the doors’, and 
then with a thousand deluded souls 
I file out into the daylight saying to 
myself—‘‘Jazzin’ God”.

Ad HOME 


O you see the home pictured on 

this page? It is a_ beautiful 
home within and without, tasteful, 
well-furnished and housing a physician 
who belongs to the City Club of 
Cleveland, Ohio, and is on the staff 
of the leading white hospital. He has 
a wife and an infant son. He is a 
former officer in the A. E. F. and 
served with distinction. He is a col- 
lege graduate and a gentleman. Yet 
when he built this home, which is the 
most tasteful if not the most costly on 
its street, the neighbors were in arms, 
the house was dynamited twice, the 
lives of its inmates endangered, the 
chief of police wounded in its protec- 
tion, and the city thrown into turmoil. 
Dr. Charles Garvin did not flinch. 
Mrs. Garvin stuck to her home and 
they are living there now in peace and 
quiet if not in love with their neigh- 
bors. All of which illustrates civili- 
zation in the United States in 1926- 
27-28. 


CHARLESTON LIBRARY 


66 HE governing Board of the 

Public Library may not exclude 
persons therefrom on account of their 
color, race or previous condition of 
servitude.” 

This is the substance of an opinion 
written by Judge Litz of the Supreme 
Court of Appeals of West Virginia. 

It constitutes a clean and clear-cut 
victory for the Charleston, West Vir- 
ginia, branch of the National Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People, which, under the leadership of 
its attorney, T. Gillis Nutter, contested 
the attempt to “jim-crow” knowledge 
at its source, in the use of books in a 
public library. 

The case arose out of a resolution 
passed by the Charleston Board of Ed- 
ucation on 12 December, 1927: “Re- 
solved, that the Secretary be requested 
to write the Librarian of the Charles- 
ton Public Library to inform any col- 
ored citizens who come into the 
Library, that in as much as the Board 
has provided Garnett Branch Library 
for their exclusive use, they must use 
such Library instead of the Charleston 
Public Library and that the Librarian 
shall be instructed to refuse to serve 
them.” 


This action met a prompt response 
from Mr. Nutter, who besides being an 


46 


able attorney, and a former member of 
the legislature of West Virginia, is 
President of the local N.A.A.C.P. Mr. 
Nutter wrote to the Board of Educa- 
tion protesting against their action and 
challenging their legal right to pass 
such a resolution. 

The Board of Education countered 
Mr. Nutter’s letter by resolving “that 
the Board deems itself bound to estab- 
lish and maintain separate libraries for 
the white and colored schools and citi- 
zens of this district and therefore de- 
clines to rescind its former orders deal- 
ing with this matter.” 

In order to establish its authority the 
Board of Education further resolved 
“that the Charleston Public Library, 
located in the capitol annex building 
be and it is hereby declared to be and 
made a part of the public school system 
of this district for the use of white 
school children and white citizens only ; 


and that the Garnett Branch Library 
now located in Shrewsberry Street 
but which is to be transferred to and 
maintained in quarters provided for it 
in the new Garnett High School Build- 
ing, plans for which the Board has 
adopted and the erection of which is 
about to commence, be and it is hereby 
declared to be and made a part of the 
public school system of this district for 
the use of colored children and colored 
citizens only.” 

Issue was now clearly joined be- 
tween the Charleston Board of Educa- 
tion and the local branch of the 
N.A.A.C.P. The Board was trying to 
have the Public Library made a part of 
the school system in order that Jim- 
crow might be legalized. 

The executive committee of the 
N.A.A.C.P. branch promptly author- 
ized Mr. Nutter to bring suit to compel

The National Interracial Conference 


OR a long time national plans have 

been developing for a National 
Interracial Conference to meet at 
Washington, D. C. Sixteen national 
organizations combined to sponsor this 
meeting. ‘These organizations were as 
follows: 


American Friends Service Committee, 
Interracial Section. ae 

American Social Hygiene Association. 

Commission on Interracial Coopera- 


tion. 
Council of Women for Home Mis- 


ions. 
: Federal Council of Churches, Commis-

ence. 

National Council Y. M. C. A. 

National Federation of Settlements. 

National Urban League. 

Phelps Stokes Fund. 

Protestant Episcopal Church, Depart- 
ment of Christian Social Service. 


In the Conference meeting Decem- 
ber 16th to 19th, there were actually 
present 151 delegates, representing: 
Organizations, 37; Colleges, 27; 
Churches, 26; United States Govern- 
ment and State Departments, 17; En- 
dowed Funds, 9; Periodicals, 5; Social 
Settlements, 4; Labor Organizations, 
4; and 22 Members at Large. 

The Committee held morning, af- 
ternoon and evening sessions, with the 
following presiding officers: Mordecai 
W. Johnson of Howard University; 
Robert R. Moton, Tuskegee Institute; 
Mary Van Kleeck, of the Russell Sage 
Foundation; Dr. George E. Haynes 
of the Federation of Churches was Ex- 
ecutive Secretary. The day sessions 
were held in the auditorium of the De- 
partment of the Interior, and the even- 
ing sessions in the auditorium of the 
Medical School of Howard University. 

Before these meetings the Research 
Committee, under Charles S$. Johnson, 
of Fisk University laid a digest of 
250 typewritten pages. The purpose 
of it was “to construct a reasonably 
faithful contemporary picture of Negro 
life and the status of race relations as 
revealed in recent social studies and in 
official statistics.” This tremendous 
piece of compilation was done with un- 
usual completeness and fairness. With 
this data before them it was the task 
of the de'egates to seek an answer to 
three questions: 

1. In the light of social research 
what do we now know about Negro 
life and race relations as affecting both

the white and colored in the 


United States? 

2. What significance has this knowl- 
edge for the programs of social organi- 
zations whose purpose it is to improve 
these conditions ? 

3. What gaps in knowledge are re- 
vealed, calling for further study by uni- 
versities and research organizations? 


races 


HE subjects taken up were as 
follows: 

Monday morning, December 17th, 
“Health”, with Louis I. Dublin, Chief 
Statistician of the Metropolitan Life 
Insurance Company, and Dr. A. B. 
Jackson, of Howard University, as 
speakers. Monday afternoon, “Edu- 
cation”, with W. A. Robinson, former 
Supervisor of Negro High Schools of 
North Carolina, and Professor Mabel 
Carney of Columbia University, and 
Principal James E. Gregg of Hamp- 
ton, as speakers. On Tuesday morn- 
ing, “Industry and Agriculture” were 
discussed by Monroe N. Work of Tus- 
kegee Institute and Niles Carpenter, of 
the University of Buffalo; on Tuesday 
afternoon, “Recreation and Housing’, 
by Forrester B. Washington of At- 
lanta, Ernest T. Attwell of New York, 
T. J. Woofter of the University of 
North Carolina, and Roscoe C. Bruce 
of New York; Wednesday morning, 
“Law Observance and Administration” 
by Thorsten Sellin of the University 


of Pennsylvania, and Lawrence Oxley. 


of North Carolina; Wednesday after- 
noon, “Citizenship and Race Rela- 
tions’, by W. E. B. DuBois of New 
York and Herbert A. Miller of Ohio 
State University. 

These sessions were attended only 
by delegates. Public sessions were held 
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday 
evening, at which general summaries 
of the discussions were given. On 
Monday evening, the speakers were F. 
O. Nichols, Raymond Pearl of Johns 
Hopkins University, and the Presi- 
dents of Fisk and Morehouse. Tues- 
day evening, the speakers were Charles 
Wesley of Howard, Mary E. Mc- 
Dowell of Chicago, R. S. Wallace, and 
John P. Frey of the American Federa- 
tion of Labor. The speakers for the 
final evening were James Weldon 
Johnson, Clark Foreman, Alain Locke, 
Julius Rosenwald, John M. Glenn, 
Edwin R. Embree, Mordecai W. John- 
son, R. R. Moton, Mary Van Kleeck 
and Anson Phelps Stokes. 


T goes without saying that with so 
ambitious and full a program the 
Conference left much to be desired. 
The discussions fell far below possibili- 


ties, partly because of lack of time and 
partly because of a certain timidity and 
fear of free expression. "There was a 
good deal of unnecessary repetition: 
the speakers repeated what the Re- 
search Committee had reported, and 
other speakers summed up what the 
main speakers had said. The net re- 
sult often was almost like spoon feed- 
ing of children lest they mentally over- 
eat. 

Nevertheless, never before in the his- 


tory of the United States have so many 


organizations, representing so diverse 
points of view and methods of ap- 
proach, come together in a spirit of 
tolerance and inquiry to seck out the 
facts which underlie the relations of 
races in the United States. 


Of course, conclusions could not be 
reached; nor were they indeed de- 
sired. The object of the meetings was 
enlightenment, and none could possi- 
bly have left without a feeling that he 
had learned something. In the matter 
of health, there is no doubt, but what 
great strides in our knowledge of the 
condition of the Negro has taken place 
in the last twenty years. No scientist 
today doubts but what the American 
Negro is going to survive and is going 
to achieve a sound body and has a 
normal brain. The great need now is 
physicians and hospitals. 

The advance in Education has set to 
rest all questions of the ability of Ne- 
groes to absorb and use modern educa- 
tion. There is still a pressing demand 
for the eradication of Negro illiteracy ; 
the betterment of Common and High 
Schools; and the endowment of good 
colleges. 


Industry and Agriculture show the 
revolution due to the migration of Ne- 
groes from South to North, and their 
entrance into industry as common and 
semi-skilled laborers. The consequent 
problems of Housing and Recreation 
are severe and pressing. 

Crime was shown not to be racial 
but the result of changing conditions 
of living; of poverty and of ignorance; 
and it is by no means certain that the 
rate of crime among Negroes is even 
as large as those among whites. 


|‘ Citizenship and Race Relations an 
insistent demand for the suffrage 


was made. One speaker said in his 
climax: “I hold this truth to be éelf- 
evident, that a disfranchised working- 
class in modern industrial civilization 
is worse than helpless. It # a menace, 
not simply to itself, but to every other 
group in the community. It will be 
diseased ; it will be criminal; it will be

The Native Problem in Africa, by 
Raymond Buell. Two volumes. 


MacMillan Company. 


HESE volumes are large and costly 

and cannot, therefore, be in the li- 
brary of the average reader; but any- 
one who wishes information concerning 
present conditions in Africa and is will- 
ing to spend some time and trouble in 
getting it, will find these two volumes 
indispensable. They form a kind of sta- 
tistical and sociological photograph of 
the African Negro in the first half of 
the twentieth century. The spirit of the 
author, while not altogether satisfac- 
tory, is good. He means to be fair, and 
while he does not see that political 
power and economic reform are the 
only solutions for the problems of 
Africa as they are for those of Europe 
and America, yet he does. realize that 
the present attitude of the white world 
toward the black world is hastening a 
crisis. 

As Mr. Buell rightly says: “Africa is 
the one continent of the world where 
by the application of intelligence, 
knowledge and good will, it is not too 
late to adopt policies which will pre- 
vent the development of the acute racial 
difficulties which have elsewhere arisen, 
and the evils of which have been 
recognized only after they have come 
into existence.” 


The American Negro. Volume 140 of 
the “Annals” of the American 
Academy of Political Science. 
HIS is a compact and interesting 
book, and ought to be in the library 

of each one of our readers. It is a series 

of papers edited by Donald Young 
with an advisory editorial committee 
of three Negroes and two white per- 
sons. It is divided into seven parts: 

Race Relations; The Negro as an Ele- 

ment in the Population of the United 

States; the Legal Status of the Negro; 

fhe Economic Achievement of the 

Negro; the Negro’s Mental Ability; 

Organization for Social Betterment; 

and Race Relations in Other Lands. It 

has a bibliography with reviews of re- 
cent books and an index. 

Nearly all prominent persons inter- 
ested in the advance of the American 
Negro, both colored and white are 
writers of these papers. Among them 
are Reutet, Frazier, Miller, Du Bois, 
Locke, Moton, Haynes, Jones, Buell, 
and White. Striking essays include 
one on “Race and Class Parallelism,” 
“The Negro Family,” “Legal Aspects

of the Negro Problem,” “The Chang- 

ing Economic Status of the Negro,” 

“The Mental Status of the Negro,” 

“The Church and Negro Progress,” 

and “The Negro in Latin America.” 

Considering its size, its readableness 

and its accuracy, this is one of the best 

compendiums on the American Negro 
ever published.

to have wide circulation. 

The Fastest Bicycle Rider in the 
World. An autobiography of 
Major W. Taylor. Wormley 
Publishing Company. 

HIS book is an interesting human 

document as this account of his 
first race will show: “My entry into 
this event was an accident pure and 
simple. I had gone out to witness the 
event, which attracted the cream of the 
amateur riders of Indiana, and had 
taken a vantage point near the start 
when Mr. Hay spotted me. Thinking 
to inject a laugh into the race for the 
benefit of the thousands that lined the 
course, Mr. Hay insisted that I take 
my place on the starting line. I re- 
belled, but he fairly dragged me and my 
bicycle across the road saying, ‘Come 
on here, young man, you have got to 
start in this race.’ I was badly scared 
at the thought as one may well imagine 
since I had never seen a bicycle race 
before. 

“Although the band was playing a 
lively tune and the crowd was cheering 
wildly, I was crying. When Mr. Hay 
saw that he started to lift me from 
my wheel, but stopped and whispered 
in my ear, ‘I know you can’t go the full 
distance, but just ride up the road a 
little way, it will please the crowd, 
and you can come back as soon as you 
get tired.’ . .. 

“After I had ridden some distance I 
noticed a group of riders coming to 
meet me. As they drew closer I recog- 
nized Mr. Hay among them. He had 
the gold medal that was hung up for 
first prize and dangled it in front of 
my eyes as we rode along. As he did 
so he informed me that I was a mile

ahead of the field and had half of the 
distance left to go. The act on 
Mr. Hay’s part was the psychological 
turning point of the race for me. From 
then on I rode like mad and wobbled 
across the tape more dead than alive in 
first place about six seconds ahead of 
the scratch man, Walter Marmon. 
Incidentally this same Walter Marmon 
is president of the Marmon Automo- 
bile Company today.” 

The Associated Publishers of Wash- 
ington, D. C., have issued two compila-

sists of biographical sketches from The 
Negro in Our History. It is a volume 
of 362 pages. The other is African 
Myths, a supplementary reader com- 
posed of folk tales filling 184 pages. 

Recent Gains in American Civiliza- 
tion, edited by Kirby Page and pub- 
lished by Harcourt, Brace and Com- 
pany, has a chapter by Charles S. John- 
son. He concludes by saying: “There 
was a time, and not so long ago, when 
even the most reasonable men recoiled 
before the meaning of a race relation 
founded upon the highest principles of 
ethics and Christianity accepted by 
themselves. And although as numbers 
go, few have actually achieved a full 
adjustment to it, or perhaps will do 
so in many decades, it can be counted 
as perhaps the greatest gain that it is 
not now so difficult to accept the prin- 
ciple.”

THE FAR HORIZON 


THE ELECTION OF- 1928 
NS that the smoke has cleared 


away, we may consider what hap- 
pened to the American Negro in the 
last election. Herbert Hoover, candi- 
date of the Republican Party, received 
91,429,109 votes. Alfred Smith, can- 
didate of the Democratic Party, 
received 15,005,497 votes. Norman 
Thomas, Socialist, received 267,835 
votes, Foster, of the Workers’ Party, 
received 48,228 votes, and Reynolds, 
Socialist-Labor Party, 21,181 votes. 
These voters chose 444 electoral votes 
for Hoover in 40 states, while Smith 
received 87 electoral votes from 8 
states. This result was brought about 
by the following debate: 


THE PRO-SMITH ARGUMENT 


HE DAILY NEWS of Jackson, 
Mississippi, published a letter by 
R. H. McDaniel: 

I’ve never had the pleasure of going 
on a lynching party, but I don’t know of 
anything that would afford me a greater 
pleasure than to have a chance to help 
lynch the Negro or Negroes that wrote 
the letter that was published in the News 
August 10, 1928, signed Equal Rights 
League—any man that calls himself a 
Democrat and then votes for Hoover 
instead of Smith for president on ac- 
count of his religious belief, and espe- 
cially a man with as clean a record as 
Smith has, is a bald face liar. He is not 
a Democrat. a ee 

The only way to keep Democracy clean 
and fit is to keep the Negro in the cot- 
ton patch, and the Republicans out of 
office. 

The Montgomery Advertiser “ac- 
cuses”’ Curtis of being on the Board of 
Directors of the N. A. A. C. P., mis- 
taking him, of course, for Capper. It 
says: 


“No Alabama Democrat can vote for 
Hoover, the anti-segregationist, without 
at the same time voting for Curtis, the 
guide, counsellor and friend of W. E. B. 
DuBois.” 


Rubin R. Arnold, an Atlanta law- 
yer, speaking in Griffin, Georgia, said: 
I do not believe that race equality is 
practiced by Tammany Hall. The only 
party I know to practice race equality 
is the Republican party in the South, 
which, as to Georgia, in the national 
convention, was represented by a dele- 
gation half black and half white, and 
which has at the head of its organization 
in Georgia Ben Davis, a Negro, of At- 
lanta, and Mamie Williams, a Negro 
woman of Savannah. I know that in 
eorgia it is the black national commit-

teeman, Ben Davis, and his associates, 
who have been levying toll upon the 
white postmasters and rural letter-car- 
riers of Gecigia for contributions to 
party. funds. 

The article in the New York Nation 
about Smith and the Negro vote was 
hailed with great glee in the South. 

The Jackson, Miss., News says: 

W. E. B. DuBois, editor of THE 
Crisis, author of “Dark Water’, the 
most intellectual Negro in America, and 
one of the meanest, bitterly assails Gov. 
Al Smith in the current number of The 
Nation. 

DuBois is a typical Northern Negro, 
graduate of Harvard, inveterate hater 
of the South and all things Southern, 
and more nearly voices the sentiments 
ot Negroes north of the Mason and 
Dixon line than any member of his race. 

He concludes his significant article 
gloomily by saying: 

“Liberals may, if they will, vote for 
Al Smith. But a vote for Al Smith is 
a vote for the Bourbon South.” 

That last paragraph is the gospel 
truth, even though it comes. from a 
South-hater. 

A vote for Governor Smith is a vote 
for the South, the old-fashioned South, 
the South that is determined to preserve 
a white man’s civilization at all hazards. 


The Wiregrass Farmer of Alabama 
says: 

Our Republican friends, following 
their well-defined policy of making every 
mean and contemptible statement possible 
against Gov. Smith, have very largely 
hinged their case against him on the 
charge that he artd Tammany Hall for- 
bade the passage of a law in New York 
State which would have stopped the prac- 
tice of marriage between the white and 
black races. This has been the most 
serious charge so far made by the Anti- 
Jemocrats. 

The Wiregrass Farmer now takes 
pleasure in presenting a resumé of the 
oficial records of the New York State 
Legislature in which it is demonstrated 
clearly that Gov. Smith had nothing to 
do with the “killing” of this proposed 
legislation. On the contrary, the record 
shows that Tammany Hall, in the person 
of Jimmie Walker, made two attempts 
to prohibit intermarriage between whites 
and blacks, and that in both instances 
these efforts were frustrated by members 
of the Republican party.

Progress 


People who are inclined to vote the 
Republican ticket next November should 
analyze the meaning of the Dyer lynching 
bill, which is one of the features of the 
Republican platform. This bill lacked 
only one vote of passing in Congress, and 


a Tammany Democrat cast the ballot 
which defeated its passage. Under the

ANTI-SMITH ARGUMENT 


HE Atlanta Georgian carried a 

full-page advertisement, marked 
“Paid Political Advertising By Anti- 
Smith Democratic Headquarters”. It 
is headed by a picture of Civil Service 
Commissioner, Ferdinand Q. Morton, 
with the legend: “$7,500 A Year 
Tammany Negro Boss And His White 
Secretary. This Is The Race Equal- 
ity That Southern Democrats May 
Expect If Tammany Wins.” Then 
there are paragraphs as follows: 


Al Smith and Tammany Hall are one 
and the same. The Tammany Demo- 
crats of New York appointed a Negro, 
Ferdinand Q. Morton, to be one of the 
Civil Service Commissioners of New 
York. The stenographer assigned him 
by the Tammany Democratic Adminis- 
tration of New York is a white American 
born woman, Florence Eckstein. 

Morton is given this place by the 
Tammany Democratic Party to pass on 
the application of every white man and 
woman Democrat in New York, who 
wants a position under the Tammany 
Democratic Administration .... 

White and black children are mixed 
in the public schools of New York under 
the Tammany Democratic Administra- 
tion. Little white children are not al- 
lowed to transfer to white schools when 
the majority of the pupils are colored. 
Negro teachers in large numbers are 
employed by the Tammany Democratic 
Administration. They teach white chil- 
dren, as well as colored, both mixed to- 
gether, in the same rooms. There are 
more than two hundred Negro police- 
men under the Democratic Tammany 
Administration. 


Paul E. Wankan, Grand Dragon of 
the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi, 
writes as follows to Mrs. M. B. Dot- 
tery: 

There will be no Third Party, as the 
time is too short. 

We have Hoover, a Republican, who 
is dry, and Smith, a Democrat, who is 
wet. We have Hoover, who is a Prot- 
estant, and Smith who is °a Romanist. 
We have Smith who believes in social 
equality and intermarriage of blacks and 
whites, and Hoover who was the last 
head of the department in Washington 
to abolish segregation. 

Tammany Hall has a Negro division,

Farewell 
By MAE V. COWDERY 


O more 

The feel of your hand 
On my my breast . 
Like the silver path 
Of the moon 


On dark heaving ocean. 


No more 

The rumpled darkness 
Of your hair 

Like the wind 

In leafy shadowed trees. 


No more 

The lush sweetness 
Of your lips 

Like dew 


On new opened Moon-flowers. 


No more 

The drowsy murmurings 
Of your voice 

Like the faint twitter 
Of birds 

In twilight. 


No more 

The poignant melody 
Of hours spent 
Between the moonrise 
And the sunrise 

Like the song 

Of a crystal river 
Going out to sea. 


Only 

The awful song 

Of silence 

In that hour a’fore the dawn 
When the moon has waned 
The stars died 

And the sun is buried 


In mist. 


Locust Trees 
By MARGARET L. THOMAS 


N O locust grows alone; 

A pine tree dares to go 
“To almost any land. 

Young willows follow brooks, 
Then one waits long to die. 

A maple in a meadow 

Lives far from other trees. 

No palm nor aloe fears solitude. 
But locust trees,— 

With pendant leaves, 

And blossoms swaying like white tails 
Of peacocks on the grass,— 

No locust grows alone. 

The scent of locust flowers, 

Deep buried in the darkness, 
Passed quick at night, 

Is like the look of one 

Who would speak, 

But cannot.

By JOHN F. MATHEUS 
HE soul of Toussaint is not dead; 
His flaming spirit flares 
Above the haughty head 
Of many a man who dares 
In Haiti still to plead 
For lands his black forefathers freed. 


And Dessalines dead still lives, 
Audacious, swart Jean-Jacques, 
Whose sword, unsheathed, yet gives 
A hope for heroes black. 

He stands in Port-au-Prince, 

An iron man, none like him since.

The slumbering Citadel, 

Some aura hides of Christophe still, 
His cause and message tell, 
Napoleon could not shake; 

His realm defeat, his courage break.

Last Night 
By ETHEL M. CAUTION 
AST night I danced on the rim of the 
moon 
Delirious and gay, 
Quite different from the mood 
I wear about by day. 


Athwart my vibrant body 

A chiffon cloud I flung, 
Diaphanous and azure, 

With starpoint brilliants hung. 


And, oh! my feet flew madly! 
My body whirled and swayed! 

My soul danced in its ecstacy 
Untrammeled, unafraid! 


Last night 1 danced on the rim of the 
moon 
Delirious and gay; 
Then slipped into my sober self 
Just ere the break of day. 


Ecstacy 
By VIRGINIA V. HOUSTON 


VEN here, dwelling in chaos, 

I find your charm is all-pervasive 
And I remember only the ecstacy 
Of soft lips covering mine 
Dragging my soul through my mouth, 
The joy of strong young arms 
Clinging, holding me ever closer, 
The exquisite agony of holding you 
In unfulfilled embrace. 


Exhortation 
By EDWARD SILVERA 


OUR hands 
Are no longer empty, brother— 
You came 
With hands full of the warm nothing- 
ness 
Of Africa: 
Stretch out your arms, brother, 
Stretch out your calloused fingers, 
Show them the corns on your palms, 
Show them the hands 
That are no longer 
Full of emptiness.

her color. William Pickens, Field Sec- 
retary of the N. A. A. C. P., was the 
third speaker, and reported on the As- 
sociation’s achievements during the

@. Lewis Howard Latimer. who died 
recently at Flushing, New York, was 
born in Chelsea, Mass., September 4, 
1848. He went to work at an early 
age’ as office boy with Crosby and 
(Gould, patent attorneys, Boston. By 
observation and intensive study, he 
gradually worked his way up to chief 
draughtsman in the office. He joined 
the Navy during the Civil War, serv-

candescent lamp department for the 
Maxim-Weston Electric Light Com-

trol of the General Electric and West- 
inghouse Electric companies was 
formed in 1896, Mr. Latimer became 
its chief draughtsman, which position 
he held until 1911, when the board 
went out of existence and he entered

lynching states, with five mob mur- 
ders, Louisiana and Texas follow with 
two each, and Missouri and New 
Mexico with one each. Georgia,

est number of lynchings, had none dur- 
ing 1928. One of the victims of the 
lynchers was a Mexican and the others 
were all Negroes. Two of the victims 
were lynched because they were broth- 
ers of the murderer of a white man. 
three were accused of murder, two of

President Coolidge in 
Washington. 

@ Miss Otelia Cromwell 
of Washington, D. C., has 
been elected to the Phi Beta 
Kappa of Smith College, 
She was selected after grad- 


uation, which is a rare 
honor. Miss Cromwell's 
thesis on Heywood has 


been published by Yale

of Congress, and is remem- 
bered by many persons who 
have frequented that busy

@ It looks as though the 
color line in Law was go-

SUALLY in thinking of February 

now I think of a moth. Some 
one handed one to me in February. 
The neat little goldish tan packet was 
fastened to a twig and I pinned the 
whole affair to a curtain and forgot 
about it. 

One night a surprisingly short time 
after I heard something like a rustle of 
window shades and wondered what the 
noise was, that little soft whisper of a 
sound near my bedside. Next morning 
it occurred to me to look at the little 
pale cocoon. I did so and found it 
open. The cocoon, colorless almost and 
as wanting in all beautiful decoration 
as the month of February, had blos- 
somed in first April just as thg trees 
were doing. But where was that moth? 

On going out on the latticed porch 
I found him. Strange how these inci- 
dents~wind together like the strands 
of fairy yarn. The wan fawn colored 
fan wings were limp and damp looking 
and touched with rose and bronze. 
There was my polyphemus moth. First 
the sound of the breaking cocoon, then 
the discovery of the moth’s escape and 


then a few minutes later the finding of 
Great Wing himself! 


Dear Me, What a Pity! 


I thought. For when it came time 
to make a bird house drawing for the 
LITTLE PAGE I found neither 
drawing pen nor ink. So the typewriter 
must draw a bird house this time. 


The Bluebirds are Coming 


HE snow’s on the bird house, 
On gable and eaves, 

The snow’s on the bird house 

On gable and eaves. 

But still I feel merry, 

For here’s February, 

And bluebirds are coming, 

The whole world believes, 

Yes, bluebirds will be here, 


The whole world believes.

Right in my eyes and at my teeth, 
And all that I can see.

I look and wonder all the while, 
And blink my eyes, and blink, 

And twist my lips to see them move. 
Grown folks would laugh, I think. 


Sometimes when I am staring hard, 
Counting what teeth I see, 

My sister cries, “Oh, mother dear! 
Boy’s acting shamefully! 


“Here making faces at himself, 
In such a silly way!” 

I can’t tell mother what I meant— 
I guess no one could say. 


Squirrel and the Crimson Leaf 


HIS must be a valentine 
Sent by some dear friend of mine. 
The wind brought it here 
And dropped it quite near, 
In fact, in this towering pine. 
It’s red as a ruby bright, 
Has corners to left and right, 
Was buried, I know, well under the 
snow, 
Till winds made it mine, all mine. 


At Chimneyside Hall 


7 a in the fireplace gave a great 

all. 

The Flames were invited to Chimney- 
side Hall. 

They came in a hurry, a rush and a 
flurry, 

In rose and vermilion, in gold and in 
blue, 

And fluttered around 

With joy to the sound 

Like cracking of fingers and baritone hum 

Like winds on the side of a loosened up 
drum! 

Low, low went the music 

And round swirled each flame 

On flaring red carpet they brought as 
they came. 

Then when all were weary 

They slipped off some way, 

And took their red carpet 

And left one of gray. 


Winter Birds 


HE little chickadee looks neat 
From skull cap to his very feet. 
His cap is made of coal black feathers. 
He wears this in all sorts of weathers. 


All winter long he’s in our trees, 
He and the titmouse, both of these, 
Titmouse like Chickadee is small, 
Yet how they differ, after all! 


For Titmouse has a dark topknot 
And hides a little golden spot 

Of feathers underneath his wing. 

I watch him as I hear him sing. 
He wheezes and goes “Leedle-leedle,” 
Perhaps he’s saying, “Eat a beetle.” 


Peace on Earth 


a does not matter much how small yeu 
are, 

I’m sure you've often heard of that 
bright star, 

Which led and led the wise men through 
the night 

To find a manger bathed with sacred 
light, 

Where lay the little Jesus slumbering, 

The holy One, the lowly One, 

Earth’s Only King.

THE Crisis 





ree 


THE N. 4. A.C. P. 
AM very glad to respond to your 
appeal for a few words of appre- 
ciation of the work of the National 
Association for the Advancement of 
Coloured People. 

There is nothing of greater impor- 
tance for the future of white civiliza- 
tion itself than the establishment of 
more just and humane relations across 
the colour line. I find the information 
given in your yearly report quite in- 
valuable for judging the symptoms of 
improvement and occasional relapse, 
and I could wish that the same thing 
were being done in respect of the col- 
oured peoples in Africa, and particu- 
larly those under the British flag. 
Your work must have the hearty sym- 
pathy of all who have any respect for 
social justice. 

Yours very sincerely, 
(Signed) L. T. Hopnouse. 
Wimbledon, England. 


DEPRIEST 


E have received the following 
letter from Margaret Deland, 
the well-known writer: 


“IT remember with great pleasure meet- 
ing you very many years ago at the house 
of my friend, Mrs. Evans, in Boston. I 
recall that William James was there 
also, and that we four had a delightful 
time. As I have always been profoundly 
interested in the political, industrial and 
spiritual welfare of the people who were 
so deeply wronged some three hundred 
years ago, I am keenly alive to the ad- 
vancement of Negro Americans to-day. 

“So, remembering your good nature 
in answering the questions I asked that 
day at Mrs. Evans’, I am venturing to 
send you the enclosed clipping in regard 
to the election to Congiess of Oscar De- 
Priest. I have a feeling that few things 
would be so impressive to persons who 
desire not only justice, but spiritual ad- 
vancement, for the colored people, as to 
have a colored man of your eminence 
protest against the political advancement 
of any persons of his race who does not 
display intellectual and moral integrity. 

f course, the same protest should be 
made to the political advancement of any 
unethical white man—and, as we both 
know well, there have been many oppor- 
tunities for such protest! But political 
indignation expressed against white 
scoundrels, in papers conducted by white 
men—desirable as such expression of 
opinion is—can not draw forth the same 


February, 1 929 


approval, as that same indignation ex- 
pressed against an unethical colored man, 
in a magazine such as THE CRIsIs. 

“T am sure that you will see my point 
in this, and I most earnestly hope that 
THE Crisis will repudiate this man in 
no uncertain terms.’ 

Tue Crisis regrets that it cannot 
do this. On the contrary, it congratu- 
lates Oscar DePriest upon his election. 
We do not approve of all that Mr. 
DePriest has done in the past and 
probably shall not approve of much 
that he will do in the future, but we 
do know that Oscar DePriest stands 
solidly and unwaveringly for the fol- 
lowing things: 

1. The enforcement of the 13th, 
14th and 15th Amendments of the 
Constitution of the United States. 

2. The passage of the Dyer-Anti 
Lynching Bill. 

3. The abolition of the “Jim-Crow”’ 
car in interstate commerce. 

4. The abolition of color segregation 
and discrimination in the Civil Service 
of the United States. 

We wish that in addition to this, 
Mr. DePriest believed in clean poli- 
tics; in the smashing of Big Business, 
bootlegging and crime in their present 
alliance for political power; and in the 
organization of political life in Chicago 
so that the intelligent will of the 
majority could be openly and efficiently 
expressed. 

We wish that Mr. DePriest stood 
for these things, but we acknowledge 
with bowed head that if he had stood 
for such a program as this he never 
would have been Congressman from 
Illinois. In other words, the only or- 
ganized interests in the United States 
who could be induced to send a colored 
man to Congress or any man who 
stands for the five things outlined 
above, are the same interests which are 
allied with the rule of wealth and 
crime. 

We find ourselves compelled in po- 
litical life, therefore, to choose the 
least of evils. If we remember that 
Senator Borah stands for clean poli- 
tics, we also are compelled to remem- 
ber that he stands for the disfranchise- 
ment of Negroes; that he did not vote 
for the DyerAnti Lynching Bill, and 
that he has grown dumb in the fight 
for Haiti. We would like to admire 
Al Smith because of the high level of 


his appointments to office, and his fight 
against the power trust. But we are 
compelled to vote against him because 
never in all his career has he given 
the slightest attention to the American 
Negro or expressed the slightest inter- 
ests in his problems. We _ support 
Oscar DePriest, therefore, for the same 
reasons that we oppose Borah and 
Smith, namely: the things that De- 
Priest stands for are more vital to the 
future of democracy in America than 
prohibition, crime and privilege. Given 
democracy in this land and we can 
fight drunkedness, prostitution and 
monopoly ; without democracy and with 
a “Solid South” we can only wobble 
between Hoover and Raskob. 


BISHOP GARDINER 


E have received the following 

letter from the Right Reverend 
James E. Freeman, the Bishop of 
Washington: 

“My attention has been called to 
your December issue in which, on pages 
409-410, you make the definite state- 
ment that Bishop Gardiner of Liberia 
‘was barred from the public dining 
room of the Willard Hotel.’ By im- 
plication this suggests that I, as host 
of the Convention, and my committee 
had done an un-Christian and ungen- 
erous thing to a respected Bishop of 
the Church. I have made careful in- 
quiry concerning this matter and find 
that the large room in which all the 
luncheons were served to the dele- 
gates, clerical and lay, Bishop Gar- 
diner, as well as Bishop Demby, were 
entertained as were all the other 
guests. Each delegate had a luncheon 
book containing tickets. These books 
were gratuitous, the expense being 
borne by the Diocese of Washington. 

An assertion made in a reputable 
paper in so definite a way as the one 
alluded to is grossly unjust and is de- 
signed, obviously, to provoke serious 
criticism. Already I am hearing from 
some of my colored brethren in the 
South that they have repudiated this 
statement, and I have in my files a let- 
ter from the chairman of the General 
Convention committee giving the pre- 
cise days on which Bishop Gardiner 
dined in the great dining room as- 
signed to the General Convention. 
While you may very properly attempt 
to correct the statement in your Decem- 


57 





ber issue, the damage done by it is 
practically beyond repair.” 

The Editor has sent the following 
reply: 

“Tt is evident that THE Crisis has 
made a mistake in this case, and we 
shall be very yzlad to do everything we 
can to rectify it. Apparently what 
happened was that Bishop Gardiner 
took luncheon regularly with the other 
churchmen; but on one day (I quote 
from a letter) ‘not being acquainted 
with affairs, it seems that Bishop 
Gardiner mistook one of the many 
private affairs being held at the Hotel 
at the same time and found himself out 
of place.’ It was this incident that 
was reported to us and which we pub- 
lished in THE CRISsIs. 

I beg to assure you that it gives 
THE Crisis great gratification to know 
that no discrimination was made at the 
Conference, and we shall say so pub- 
licly.” 


THIRD PARTY 

HE pressing political problem in 

the United States is that of es- 
tablishing the principle of a Third 
Party’ movement. It does not matter 
how logical and convincing an appeal 
is launched by any group, unless they 
can effectively place this before the 
voters of the nation, their work is in 
vain. For many years we have seen 
in the United States the rise of Third 
Party movements which have come to 
naught. They have failed, not be- 
cause they did not have a good pro- 
gram and a right to persist and grow, 
but because they could not get the 
proper political hearing. 

The difficulty of making the appeal 
of the Third Party effective, arises in 
part from our indirect method of 
electing presidents, but the greater rea- 
son is the so-called Solid South. This 
is a difficulty which for years no gen- 
tleman was permitted to discuss. Any- 
one who dared to attack or arraign 
the astonishing political machine which 
dominates twelve states of the United 
States and is in almost absolute control 
of 124 out of 531 electoral votes, is 
supposed to be reactionary, opposed to 
“national unity and a fanatic on the 
race problem. Hiding back of these 
excuses, there has been built up in the 
South a political machine before which 
Tammany pales into insignificance. It 
is a machine which dictates the presi- 
dency, declares war, fosters imperial- 
ism, maintains a pfotective tariff, bol- 
sters plutocracy, and above all, makes 
the chances of any Third Party move- 
ment impossible. 


Yet, strange to say, every recent 
Third Party movement that we have 
had, has begun its career by appealing 
to this machine for liberal support! 


58 


Even the Socialists, before the War, 
cast longing eyes in this direction. 
The Populists staked their all upon it. 
The Progressives, led by Theodore 
Roosevelt, made their chief appeal to 
this Southern machine, and _ the 
Farmer-Labor Party, while it did not 
actually appeal to the South, refused 
in any way, even by implication, to. at- 
tack Southern political methods. 

The Socialists in the last campaign 
attacked the Solid South. Their at- 
tack was not given prominence or de- 
veloped as its importance demanded, 
but, nevertheless, the platform did de- 
mand the “reduction of the representa- 
tion in Congress of thuse states where 
large sections of the citizens are dis- 
franchised by force or fraud.” And 
the “Open Letter to American Lib- 
erals and Progressives” was even more 
explicit. 

“The very backbone of the Demo- 
cratic Party, the old, reactionary bour- 
bons of the South are still engaged in 
the shameful policy of making it all 
but impossible for great numbers of 
the Negro population to vote; a South- 
ern bourbon class which, with the in- 
dustrialization of the South, is now 
pressing its claims for high tariffs and 
for the private exploitation of the 
water powers not already bequeathed 
by the nation to private monopoly.” 


Even here the main result was not 
sufficiently stressed, and that result is 
that of the 531 electoral votes, a Third 
Party today can only appeal to 407. 
Even if the party gained a majority of 
the popular votes back of these 407 
electoral votes, nevertheless, with the 
help of the Solid South, the Demo- 
cratic Party could be triumphantly 
elected. What happens then, continu- 
ally, (it happened in 1912, in 1924 
and in 1928), is that the practical 
voter has to choose between the Demo- 
cratic ticket, backed by the Solid South, 
and a Republican ticket; and if after 
several years of Republican govern- 
ment, being convinced that nothing 
could be worse, he tries Democracy it 
is with disastrous results. The politi- 
cal power of the South, built on the 
forced disfranchisement of two million 
Negroes and the voluntary disfran- 
chisement of more than two million 
whites, concentrates in the hands of a 
ruthless gang, more political power 
than any machine in the United States 
ever wielded before. It must be at- 
tacked and atatcked frankly and openly, 
and the smoke screen of the “Negro 
problem” must not divert the attack. 

The results of the election of 1928 
illustrate the situation: 


Eleven Southern states cast, in 1924, 
2,865,747 votes. In 1928, they cast 
3,632,292. Thus, of more than four 
million disfranchised voters, one mil- 
lion came to the polls, and the Demo- 


crats consequently lost 5 states with 
60 electoral votes. 

But was this a real triumph of 
democracy, and a “breaking’’ of the 
Solid South? Nothing of the sort. 
While they voted against the machine, 
these voters did so for no modern rea- 
sons. They voted because of religious 
prejudice, hatred of the party domina- 
tion of New York, fear of the Negro, 
and prohibition. Of the modern prob- 
lems presented, for instance, by Social- 
ists, they knew nothing and cared 
nothing. They had no intelligence of 
nor intelligent answers to the problems 
of protecting labor, curbing monopoly 
and privilege, preserving natural re- 
sources, equitable taxation of incomes, 
and preventing crime. ‘The million 
new electors who came into the field 
were densely ignorant and prejudiced. 
For the most part they continued to 
assert their party “regularity”’, i.e. their 
voluntary disfranchisement so far as 
national questions go, and they reas- 
serted their determination to enforce 
the 18th amendment, to nullify the 
14th and 15th, and to ignore the 19th. 

In future elections, as in the past, 
these 124 electoral votes can be ap- 
pealed to by no Third Party and can 
be depended on to keep reaction and 
Plutocracy in power. To make assur- 
ance doubly sure, Work is backing 
the “Lily White” faction of the South- 
ern Republicans whose program is not 
simply to disfranchise Negroes at the 
polls, but also in the party councils. 

Here, then, is the first point of at- 
tack for any Third Party that is worth 
its salt or hopes ever to win. 


SEGREGATION 

UR attention has been called to 

the fact that in our statement 
concerning Segregation in December, 
the sentence “Segregation in rooms by 
race has practically disappeared”, can 
be misinterpreted. What we meant to 
say was that segregation in separate 
rooms by race had disappeared. There 
is still widespread a custom of group- 
ing colored and white clerks in the 
same room. 


A HERO 

Village, Va. 

December, 1928. 
R. HOWARD ABNER MAR- 
TIN of Village, Virginia, a 
graduate of the G. A. and I. School, 
Cappahosic, Virginia, was a great edu- 
cational worker. So much that he sac- 
rificed his home in order that the 
children in his community might have 
a comfortable school building. By so 
doing, he was forced to leave home in 

search of work to redeem his home. 
On June 14th, 1928, he started out 

to find employment.

THE BORDER STATES 
@ The State Legislature of Kentucky 
has appropriated more than $600,000 
for the state normal schools at Frank- 
fort and Paducah and $800,000 for 
new Negro schools in Louisville; 
$100,000 was refused for an institution

@ Fisk University at Nashville has 
been given $400,000 by the General 
Education Board for a new library 
building. The most unusual feature 
of the gift is that it is made outright 
with no requirement that Fisk raise 
an equivalent sum. 
@ Mrs. R. H. Boyd, wife of the late 
Dr. R. H. Bayd, died recently at

Mrs. Boyd is not known, as she was

ored Catholic institution, $800,000, 
and a like sum to the Good Shepherds, 
where white and colored are cared for. 


THE MIDDLE WEST 


@ The African Art Sponsors, com- 
posed of representative Negro citizens 
of Cleveland, Ohio, held a banquet at 
the Museum of Natural History in 
December, when Paul Travis, artist 
and member of the faculty of the 
Cleveland School of Art, displayed his 
collection of native African art, which 
he secured while he was abroad re- 
cently. Travis’ work was aided by a 
contribution of $15,000 provided by 
the African Art Sponsors and the Gil- 
pin Players. The material collected 
is to be divided between the Cleveland 
Museum of Natural History and the 
Cleveland Museum of Art. 


@ No hotel in Cleveland would permit: 


the formal banquet to be held under 
its roof. Attorney Harry E. Davis 
and Russell W. Jelliffe, director of 
the Playhouse Settlement, appeared be- 
fore the Hotel Managers’ Association 
and presented arguments in behalf of 
permitting Negroes to be granted the 
use of hotel dining rooms. They were 
accorded a reception and their plea 
taken under advisement. The atti- 
tude of the Hotel Managers is in direct 
violation of the Ohio Civil Rights 
bill, which is not easy to enforce.

@ The Victory Life Insurance Com-

@ At the end of the fiscal year, Oc- 
tober 31, 1928, the Victory Life In- 
surance Company reported that its 
premium income for the year approx- 
imated $350,000. This is an increase 
from $210,000 for 1927. The total 
income for the year was $75,000 
in excess of disbursements. Reserves 
on the business in force were close to 
$295,000. Assets of the company 
were considerably over $500,000. For 
the first ten months of the year, the 
company had an increase in the busi- 
ness in force of something more than 
$3,000,000. This was almost fifty per 
cent increase of the business in force 
in 1927. The company has paid to 
agents in ten months of this year more 
than was paid during the entire year 
of 1927. This means that the income 
of agents will be increased by one- 
sixth in 1928 as compared with 1927. 
@ The outright gift of Dr. John T. 
Wilson of $50,000 has made it pos-

a charitable corporation chartered un- 
der the laws of the State of Illinois. 
The buildings, grounds and equipment 
are valued at $750,000. 

@ The University of Wisconsin pub- 
lished recently a list of men who were

John W. Lawlah, a graduate of More-

@ During the war, a British Gover- 
nor of the Gold Cuast sequestered

Crisis 





Far Horizon 
(Continued from page 49) 


and I am enclosing you copy of record 
appearing in the Negro year book. 
Smith's record on the Negro question is 
ten times blacker than that of Hoover’s, 


and of course it is needless for me to say 


that I intend to vote for the Republican 
electors. They will be the Lily White 
electors, not the Perry Howard electors. 

It is a question of country, and I ex- 
pect to stay with the country in opposi- 
tion to the alien-controlled, Rome-ridden, 
Negro-loving, rum-selling Tammany 
gang. The Smith forces are going to 
seek to force us all to vote for Smith 
on the Negro question, and that little 
bubble will all be punctured and we 
won't hear much more of it after our 
campaign gets under way. 

Bishop Cannon of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, South, speaking at 
Bristol, Virginia, attacked Governor 
Smith for his ‘““Tammany affiliations.” 

He asserted that Ferdinand Morton, 
Negro, a Tammany member of the Civil 
Service Commission of New York, had 
two white stenographers. At the same 
time the Bishop defended Herbert 
Hoover from charges that the Repub- 
lican candidate favored intermingling of 
the races on terms of equality. 


“Are those New York stenographers 
girls?” some one asked the Bishop from 
the audience. 

“About forty years old I should say,” 
the Bishop replied. 

“Tammany has other white girls work- 
ing under Negroes,” he continued. “The 
Civil Service Commission in New York 
consists of a Republican, an American 
Jew, a Roman Catholic Democrat and 
a Negro Tammanyite.” 

A personal investigation conducted by 
himself of the race situation in Mr. 
Hoover's office, he said, revealed that 
Mr. Hoover separates the Negro and 
white races in a Southern way. 


THE NEW SOUTH 

HE progressive South was not 
silent under all this. The News 

Leader of Richmond, Virginia, said: 
Why should the South go backward 
politically? Why should it be the slave 
of unfounded fears? The Negro has 
not involved himself in this campaign. 
He did not make the VOLSTEAD act. 
He nominated neither HOOVER nor 
SMITH. He is Protestant but he is 
not anti-Catholic and, manifestly, he is 
not an ally of the Klan. In the greater 
Part of the South, the Negro has been 
attending to his own business, and where 
¢ has shown any political stirring what- 
‘ver, it has been in an effort to affiliate 
with the Democratic party, in protest 
against ostracism by the “Lily White” 
epublicans, The vote that can be cast 
y the Negroes in November will be 
negligible in the South, and it will not 
¢ swollen perceptibly by Republican 
electioneering—certainly not by the peo- 


February, 1929 


ple who are going over to HOOVER be- 
cause they do not like SMITH. It is 
unfair to charge them with any desire 
to enleague themselves with the Negroes 
against their own section. 

The South’s political salvation is not 
to be worked out through a unity born 
of hate, of ignorance, or of self-deception. 

A number of distinguished South- 
erners, including ministers, lawyers, 
presidents of colleges and_ editors, 
joined in a protest: 


We .... call upon the leadership of 
the South—the pulpit, the press, the plat- 
form—and upon every right-thinking man 
and woman among us to disclaim, dis- 
courage and discountenance such appeals 
to prejudice and fear, to the end that the 
gains of recent years in interracial good- 
will and understanding may not be sacri- 
ficed to the passing interest of a political 
campaign. 

LILY WHITES 
HE movement to extend the dis- 
franchisement of Negroes at the 
polls to the councils of the party, re- 
ceived strong impetus from Herbert 
Hoover, in his speech at Elizabethton, 
‘Tennessee. 

J. B. Skipper, white Republican 
leader of Florida. makes this interpre- 
tation: 

Your Committeeman will check over 
each recommendation before they are 
submitted to the President and, as Mr. 

Hoover has declared, no one can be ap- 
pointed if objectionable to our Southern 
people. 

“Our 
white ! 


Southern people” are all 


Ed Thompson, a colored politician 
of Key West, makes this reply: 

I have been a Republican all of my 
52 years, have given of my time, money 
and labor towards the upbuilding of the 
Republican Party in the State of Florida, 
and while I will not vote for Mr. 
Hoover and his Lily White Cohorts and 
policies, still I cannot vote for the Demo- 
cratic candidate on account of the prin- 
ciples and policies of the Democratic 
party as laid down in this, our South- 
land. On Election Day I will be out 
fishing, the right place I think for all of 
us Negroes and especially our so-called 
leaders on this day. 


A private letter explains the situa- 
tion in Florida: 


“George Bean, national committee- 
man, and one Gerow, state chairman, 
were the ‘leaders’ of the Republican Par- 
ty there. State law provided that, when 
candidates on any ticket polled 10% of 
the vote for certain offices, the backers 
of that ticket gained the stature of a 
political party, entitled to conduct its 
own primary in which, of course, it also 
would choose its party leaders. The 
Republicans, a number of years ago, hap- 
pened to poll more than 10% of the vote 
for the specified offices, and gained the 
privilege of conducting a primary. In 
that primary, Bean and Gerow were

N.A.A.C.P. Battle Front 
(Continued from page 46) 


the admission of Negroes to the Public 
Library. He employed C. E. Kim- 
brough, a colored attorney to assist 
him. On March 13, three colored 
people, Messrs. Brown, Powell and 
Sanders, went to the library, at the 
instance of the attorneys, asked for 
books, and were refused them. 

The next step in this battle was the 
filing of a petition for an Alternative 
Writ of Mandamus which would 
compel the Board of Education to ad- 
mit Negroes to the Library and permit 
them to use its facilities. On the 12th 
of April, Judge Arthur P. Hudson of 
the Circuit Court declined to grant the 
writ of Mandamus, holding: “It is the 
opinion of the Court that the Acts of 
the Legislature referred to make the 
Public Library a part of the Public 
School System of the city of Charles- 
ton, and under the laws of this State, 
as expressed in the Constitution and 
Acts of the Legislature, it is proper for 
the Board to provide separate library 
buildings for white and colored per- 
sons.” 

A setback, but not the end, by any 
means. 

Messrs. Nutter and Kimbrough at 
once filed a petition for a Writ of 
Error and Supersedeas to the Supreme 
Court of Appeals of the State. The 
writ was granted and the case was set 
for argument on the 13th of November. 

When the case was heard and the 
Court rendered its opinion, it was 
found that this highest tribunal of the 
State of West Virginia had sustained 
every point raised by the colored at- 
torneys. It held that the Public Li- 
brary was not a part of the school sys- 
tem as the Board of Education had 
tried to make it, and that the Board of 
Education could not establish a “jim- 
crow” system there, thus overruling the 
lower court. 

This case did not concern merely the 
Charleston Public Library. It was of 
importance for the colored people in 
other cities of the state. For Bluefield 
and Martinsburg had taken similar ac- 
tion and the colored people were being 
excluded from the public libraries in 
those cities. In this, as in so many 
cases fought by the N.A.A.C.P. or its 
branches, through the courts of first 
instance to those of highest jurisdiction, 
a principle was established which gov- 
erned other instances as well as the one 
occasioning the suit. 


The victory, which was greeted with 
jubilation by the colored people of 
West Virginia, was the more impres- 
sive, in that the two colored attorneys 
had confronted and won from Price, 
Smith and Spillman, one of the leading 
white firms of the State, representing 
the Board of Education.

The Browsing Reader 
(Continued from page 48) 


“How Race Prejudice is Overcome” 
is discussed by George D. Collins in the 
World Tomorrow for October. Mr. 
Collins thinks that inter-racial groups 
and the influence of student Christian 
Associations are to a great degree re- 
sponsible for the increasing fellowship 
between white and colored college stu- 
dents in Southern States. 

Edward Campbell Aswell, a white 
Southerner, who believes the Negro to 
be docile, indolent, and not capable of 
sustained effort, writes on “The Church 
and the Negro” in the Commonweal for 
November 21st. The history of the 
South, says Mr. Aswel, has been almost 
wholly the history of the changing 
phases of the race question. For this 
reason, any proposed change in_ the 
status of the Negro, should challenge 
the attention of the Southern whites. 
The Protestant South should welcome 
the efforts of the Catholic church to 
convert Negroes to Catholicism because

the first virtue of the Catholic church is 
ility ! 

Mciled studies of the policies of 
three typical Negro newspapers, The 
New York Age, The Pittsburgh Cour- 
ier and The Chicago Defender, have 
heen made by Gladstone H. Yeuell, 
who discusses “The Negro Press as a 
Factor in Education” in The Journal 
of Educational Sociology for October. 
Forty-nine and sixty-seven per cent of 
the straight reading matter of these 
papers is included under social better- 
ment news; 31.28 per cent is classed 
as neutral; and 19.05 per cent as anti- 
social. Mr. Yeuell comes to the con- 
clusion that the Negro press does not 
differ materially from its white proto- 
type. 

“The omniscience of the South on 
the race question is only equalled by the 
nescience of the North.” This sen- 
tence from the Independent Magazine 
twenty years ago, when lynching was 
at its height, was an apt summation of 
the knowledge of that period on the 
Negro question. Herbert J. Seligmann 
in Current History for January, re- 
views the last ““T'wenty Years of Negro 
Progress” and says that these years 
have been meaningful ones for black 
America. Scientifically, Mr. Seligmann 
says, there has been nothing to prove 
that the Negro is incapable of any level 
of cultivation yet .attained by white 
man. 

Claude McKay 
“White Houses”: 
“Your door is shut against my tight- 

ened face, 

And I am sharp as steel with discon- 
tent, 
But I possess the courage and the grace, 
To bear my anger proudly and un- 
bent.” 
This is the spirit of the contemporary 
Negro—the spirit of protest and revolt. 
The day of “Uncle Tom” has passed! 
P. M. Fox, who writes on “The Negro 
Renaissance” in The Labour Magazine 
tor November, says that in this spirit 
of revolt and protest, the literature of 
minority groups has much in common. 
W. E. E. B. Du Bois, Mr. Fox says, is 
alive to the enslaving influence of eco- 
nomic imperialism, and has sounded a 
call to his people to realize its dangers. 

The American Mercury for January 
carries “I Investigate Lynchings”, by 
Walter White, Assistant Secretary of 
the National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People. Mr. 
White offers a few interesting vignettes 
on lynchings he has investigated and 
an amusing side light or two on the 
grave charge of “passing”. 

Allison Davis in Plain Talk for 
January says that the bourgeois ‘Negro 
Deserts His People.” In discussing the 
Unproductive Negro upper class, Mr. 


has written’ in 


February — 920 


Davis strikes a note which perhaps may 
be considered too critical, but his cen- 
sure is deserved and true. The Negro, 
he says, is color mad and is a slave to 
the myth of “white over black”. 
MarvEL JACKSON. 


Negro Schools 
(Continued from page 44) 


pick up threads of the past. ‘There 
were two colored banks. One has sur- 
vived, and it is the one that deserved 
to survive. Avery is still the city High 
School and the city still refuses to sup- 
port it; the students looked awake lin- 
ing the gallery, and sang well. ‘There 
was a little dinner before the lecture 
with singular cross-currents of religion 
and art, education and business, com- 
promise and resentment. The audi- 
ence was intelligent. 


JIM-CROW 


I rode to Augusta, starting early. 
This riding in the South is interesting. 
From New York to Sedalia, 463 miles, 
I went in a Pullman. After reaching 
the South I traveled in a Pullman, 190 
miles back to Virginia—and then 275 
miles from Columbia to Jacksonville; 
166 miles from Atlanta to Tuskegee 
and 205 miles from Birmingham to 
Nashville. 

In all these cases, however, special 
and careful arrangements had to be 
made. Friends of mine who knew 
some white persons or officials of im- 
portance, had to intercede and conduct 
subtle negotiations. Where the mat- 
ter was a night ride, as from Greens- 
boro to Petersburg, Columbia to Jack- 
sonville, and Birmingham to Nashville, 
the matter was arranged with a cer- 
tain secrecy and ease. After all, the 
white folk did not see their dark pas- 
senger until morning had dawned, and 
he was already there. And in most 
cases, even then, they said nothing. In- 
deed, at Petersburg, they were quite 
polite, and at Jacksonville and Nash- 
ville, they bore up without comment, 
so far as I could see. The matter of 
the day ride from Atlanta to Tuskegee, 
was of course much more grave. I 
paid $6.30 to ride in the drawing 
room. If I had been white, I could 
have ridden in some of the empty seats 
of the main car at a cost of less than 
$2.00. 

On the “Jim Crow” car I rode fre- 
quently and at length. From Peters- 
burg to Raleigh, 190 miles, over the 
Seaboard: the Negro coach was half of 
a smoker and not as modern a coach 
as that of the whites. It was, how- 
ever, clean and the conductor said 
“please” when he asked for tickets. 
This is a decided improvement over 
ten years ago. The news boy, or rather 
the news old man, was unobtrusive and

CLUB CAROLINE 
262 WEST 127TH SYTSEET 
NEW YORK CITY 


A Residence for Women 


Housekeeping and non-house- 
keeping facilities 


kept in his place. From Selma to 
Fayetteville, I rode fifty miles on a 
separate coach, old and empty. From 
Hamlet to Charlotte I rode seventy 
miles over the Seaboard in a miserably 
dirty car which any decent State Board 
of Health would have condemned. 
From Charlotte to Columbia I was 
on the Southern in a fairly clean coach, 
but very slow and roundabout, taking 
nearly six hours to go 108 miles. 
From Jacksonville to Charleston, I 
not only could get no Pullman for the 
all-day ride of nearly three hundred 
miles, but I could not even get a ticket 
on the nine o'clock train, which was 
the fast train, and connected with 
Charleston by coach. I must go on the 
9:05, which took an hour longer! 


I remembered of old that ride from 
Charleston to Augusta, five hours for 
150 miles. From Nashville, north, there 
were difficulties about certain crack 
trains. The Noon train which makes 
only one stop to Bowling Green was 
all Pullman. I could not go on that. 
I had to take the half past eleven train, 
which occupied three hours instead of 
two. From Bowling Green to Cin- 
cinnati, had I been white, I should 
have taken the 10:41, arriving bright 
and rested, at 8:00 A.M. As it was, 
I started the next morning and took 
the 9:46, having an all-day ride of 231 
miles, looking out at principally noth- 
ing, from an almost empty car. 

My chief joy in these “Jim Crow” 
rides was these empty cars. The auto- 
mobile is certainly bringing just ret- 
ribution upon the silly profiteering of 
Jim Crow. All over and everywhere 
the colored people are traveling in their 
automobiles. They took me from 
Raleigh to Selma, sixty miles, by auto; 
from Fayetteville to Hamlet, sixty 
miles; from Jacksonville to Daytona, 
and back, 200 miles; from Tuskegee 
to Talladega, 95 miles, and from Tal- 
ladega to Birmingham, 121 miles; five 
hundred and thirty-six miles by auto, 
and only my lack of time kept me from 
increasing this. By auto, of course, 
we avoided all sorts of things: the 
waits for tickets in the depot; at Char- 
lotte, the ticket agent served every 
single white person at the white win- 
dow before he came around to the 
colored window. I must have stood 
for fifteen minutes. The matter of 
food and luncheons was, of course, 
made easy. In fact, the only discrim- 
inations that we chanced upon was one 
at which we heartily laughed: a fill- 
ing Station on the Jacksonville-Day- 
tona road had a sign “For white trade 
only”. We passed it four times and 
saw no single car there. “These 
Crackers persist in being fools!” says 
my companion. 

Especially is the automobile a boon 
for the colored Bishops, the officials 
of fraternal societies, insurance agents, 


and the like. I remember once that 
the venerable Bishop Turner stricken 
with paralysis, could for neither 
love nor money, hire a Pullman 
berth from Savannah to Atlanta. 
They fixed the old man up in the “Tim 
Crow” smoker across two seats. Yes- 
terday, I saw the African A. M. F. 
Bishop of Florida. He was gliding 
along in his Cadillac car with a chauf- 
feur on the way from Jacksonville to 
Atlanta. He looked extremely com- 
fortable. 


AUGUSTA AND ATLANTA 

UGUSTA shows a sort of dog- 

ged stagnation. It is the home 
of rich Northern golfers, grim cotton 
mills, and disinherited black folk. For 
fifty years it has refused any substan- 
tial improvement to its Negro schools 
and the Negro section still has its un- 
paved _ streets. Increasing _ poverty 
among the poor white folk is leading 
to every effort among the well-to-do 
whites to displace Negro labor. In 
fact, this movement is characteristic 
of the Southeast. It is perhaps wid- 
est in Florida, where the whites have 
poured in from Georgia and Alabama, 
like a plague of locusts. Wherever 
they could get a Negro’s job by legis- 
lation or mob violence, they did so. 
The Negroes underbid them only by 
semi-servile work, as for instance, when 
white women of Jacksonville canvassed 
the business center for white truck- 
men; it was revealed that the colored 
truckmen not only drove their trucks, 
but loaded and underloaded them; 
which, of course, no lordly white men 
would be expected to do! So in Au- 
gusta, the colored people are fighting 
for lowly jobs. 

Haines Institute looked grey and 
slow. Its guiding genius still sits 
within, sedate and firm, and lonesome. 
Yes, Lucy Laney looks lonesome. 
Haines calls for new blood and new 
blood means new money. ‘There was 
an intelligent and responsive audience, 
both of citizens and of students. 

Atlanta is taller and fiercer and 
richer. A terrible blood-sucking 
crowded hell with heavens for the 
white rich, roundabout, outside. 
Money, money and gaud. No cul- 
ture, no humanity, American in the 
crassest sense. Here even as in Jack- 
sonville and Augusta, they are piling 
the white “Crackers” on black folk, 
and adding insult. At the depot, no 
colored persons can hire a yellow cab, 
and no black man can keep his cab 
at or even near the depot. All the 
Negro quarter is neglected. “The main 
bridge from the center of Negro popu- 
lation out past Atlanta University to 
the High School is broken down and 
roped off. The High School and all 
the colored schools have two and three 
sessions a day. Down in the low bot-

toms is the unpaved mud and unsew- 
ered homes of the black poor, looking 
much as they did twenty years ago, 
when I first saw them. Ugliness is 
rampant in Atlanta save in the white 
residential developments that circle 


_roundabout and add suave and gracious 


beauty to the carcass of the city. A 
city of dope and coca-cola. Atlanta 
University is falling behind in build- 
ings and equipment. It has its old 
spirit, its library and laboratories and 
a good body of students, but they are 
not as enthusiastic and do not give the 
evidence of intelligence that I saw in 
many other schools. New blood and 
new ideas are needed in the faculty; 
and yet probably no institution in the 
South has so significant a body of loyal 
alumni. Over across the hill are 
Morehouse and Spelman. 1 did not 
see Morehouse in the light, but the 
alert body of Morehouse and Spelman 
students was up to the highest mark. 
I could feel the audience thrill beneath 
me. I am not sure about the More- 
house teachers. I saw only a few. But 
Spelman has risen from the dead. It 
has a library with books, a new and 
beautiful quadrangle and a _ chapel 
which is a shrine, although one is sorry 
that it wasn’t built to be something 
more useful than a shrine. The Presi- 
dent is an energetic woman, whom it 
is a pleasure to meet. 


TUSKEGEE 

ND now to ‘Tuskegee. It is 

twenty-five years or more since I 
saw Tuskegee. Booker Washington 
was then at his zenith and the Tuske- 
gee idea was triumphant. It was a 
combination of something insistent 
but suspicious that led to my invita- 
tion twenty-five years ago to talk to 
the Tuskegee summer school. I come 
back to find the school a city. One 
can no longer speak of a single insti- 
tution, or judge this mass of buildings, 
roads and institutions as one thing. It 
is a great historic growth, and most 
significant of all, it has grown beauti- 
ful. It lies in curving undulating hills, 
with pines and trees and grass, and 
the happy voices of thousands of young 
folk. 

I was interested to know about these 
young people, but I had only time to 
glimpse them. In other days, Tuske- 
gee was a silent marching regiment. 
It had no soul. There is still regi- 
mentation. The silence of the chapel 
was uncanny. The marching is over- 
done, and yet, the grade of the stu- 
dents, their intelligence, their initiative, 
has greatly increased. I talked to a 
college of over 100 students (fancy a 
college at Tuskegee! and no openings 
of graves, no waving of cerements.) 

hey were bright-eyed men and wo- 


February, 1929 





men. They were doing something. 
But, of course, Tuskegee is caught in 
the problem of its own making. It 
has its artisans and its grammar school 
students, its High School students, and 
its college, it has its teachers, who 
are a jumble of all kinds of culture 
and training. Only the unity of a 
great ideal can carry such an_insti- 
tution on to success. And there can 
be no doubt, it is moving on. 

The National Hospital at Tuskegee 
is a miracle. Here black Americans 
have done the impossible with great 
buildings and beautiful grounds, and 
the Circle of the officers dwellings. 
The spirit of efficiency and discipline, 
is exactly the thing which even black 
people, a few years ago, suid we were 
not prepared for. Of the fifty-one 
Veterans’ Hospitals, this one stands 
well within the first half dozen. It 
has an excellent library with books that 
are read. It has secured experts, and 
it succeeded in the face of an Alabama 
mob, which threatened to lynch Rob- 
ert R. Moton, unless he put white men 
in the control of the hospital, and sent 
“nigger nurse maids” to wait on white 
nurses, lest they touch black skins. One 
can hardly reconstruct that extraordi- 
nary outburst, even in memory. 

There has been reconstruction at 
Fisk University. It is the one insti- 
tution that I visited which feels thor- 
oughly modern, and that feeling 
comes in some very little things. When 
I think that for thirteen years I had 
to get up at Atlanta University and 
eat breakfast at 6:45, I unconsciously 
make one test of modern culture, the 
hour of breakfast in these schools. It 
varies from 6 A. M. on. But at Fisk 
alone, is there a moveable breakfast 
hour from seven to seven thirty, with 
students who may go and come, with- 
in these limits. Men students smoke 
on the Fisk campus. I am not sure 
about the women. I hope they do, 
too. The men and women mingle 
quite naturally. I saw them walking 
and talking together at times and 
places, which would have sent us to 
the penitentiary in my day, and made 
them liable to hanging, drawing and 
quartering under the MacKenzie re- 
gime. 

All this does not solve the problem 
of discipline by any means. It simply 
opens the door to its solution. There 
must be scores of young people who can 
not stand this freedom, having never 
been required to before. But it gives 
one a sigh of human relief to see baby 
nurses and swaddling clothes dropping 
at last from grownup Negro students. 

Fisk has a good library. It has ex- 
cellent laboratories in Chemistry and 
Biology. It needs buildings. In Fisk, 
everything except historic Jubilee and 
the chapel could well be swept out of

existence and modern structures put

In teaching force, Fisk has the dif. 
ficulty of the newer Negro colleges, 
It is more and more easy to get black 
men who know higher m: ithematics, 
but these men may not know enough 
not to proceed the hostess out of the 
dining room. Difficulties of culture 
and knowledge are bound to recur at 
an institution like Fisk. But the same 
thing is true when we compare West- 
ern and Eastern universities, or Amer- 
ican and English. Knowledge comes 
but culture lingers. Fisk and °Tal- 
ladega were the only institutions on my 
list that dare choose “The Russian 
Revolution” as one of the subjects, and 
on the night after the lecture, there 
was assembled in the historic parlors 
of Jubilee, a gathering that astounded 
me. ‘Teachers and students mingling 
quite freely. A few white teachers and 
one or two students from Vanderbilt 
and other white institutions, and fif- 
teen or sixteen representatives of for- 
eign peoples: Chinese, Italians, South 
Americans, Russians, Dutch, Swiss, 
and others. It was an unusual and 
"inspiring scene. 

There is always one looming and 
insistent difficulty at Fisk: the teachers 
and students of white Vanderbilt and 
Peabody come in contact with at least 
the white Fisk teachers and executives. 
Unconsciously they will seek to dom- 
inate and advise, and the authorities at 
Fisk may easily be tempted to defer to 
this public opinion, rather than to the 
more reticent and poorly expressed 
public opinion of the black world. But 
right here, let Fisk beware. It went 
on the rocks in a former administra- 
tion because the Chamber of Com- 
merce of Nashville tried to set stand- 
ards for it. The standards of Fisk 
University are being set today by its 
own Alumni and the colored world. 
It must continue in this line despite 
Vanderbilt, Peabody and all white 
Nashville. 

Talladega is a small, quiet New 
England college, built in the heart 
of Alabama. It has splendid work 
in biology, a thorough going li- 
brary, good dormitories, and probably 
the best dining hall in the colored 
South. It has a President who is 
quiet and courteous and gives his teach- 
ers and officers real authority, and it 
has, what seems to me, a rather un- 
usual collection of white and colored 
teachers and officers. Talladega is to- 
day one of the best and best growing 
institutions of the South. 

I made my last speech to the colored 
citizens of Bowling Green in a Baptist

was speaking. But it was a kindly

Interracial Conference 
(Continued from page 47) 


ignorant; it will be the plaything of 
mobs, and it will be insulted by caste 
restrictions.” 

The whole bogie of inherent, inerad- 
icable race distinctions was attacked. 
“Races that try to be exclusive are both 
the producers and the consumers of 
each other’s goods. The tompetition of 
laborers seems immediate and threaten- 
ing. However, with a rising tide of 
economic activity, no race is self- 
sufficient, and the organization of in- 
terracial labor will be just as easily 
demonstrated and just as necessary as 
is international banking.” 

One comes from a meeting of this 
sort with a distinct feeling that all of 
the labor and devotion which was put 
into this ought not to be lost. There 
is no need for any super-organization. 
Agreement is not yet wide enough for 
a movement of this kind; but THE 
Crisis suggests that the following 
program be carried out, to obviate, 
on one hand, such an impossible crowd- 
ing of problems and spoiling of real 
conference and discussion as was inevi- 
table at this meeting; and on the other 
hand, to widen and deepen our knowl- 
edge of facts. 

THE Crisis proposes that the spon- 
soring organizations, and any other 
organizations that may wish to come 
in, should arrange a comprehensive pro- 
gram; admission should depend upon 
willingness to inaugurate, with the co- 
operation and consent of consulting 
Committee of experts, a long  in- 
tensive scientific study of some one 
phase of the Negro problems; and that 
there be held each year a meeting at 
which the result of one of these lines 
of study be reported to the public and 
adequately and thoroughly discussed. 
The following year another subject 
should be taken up, etc. At the begin- 
ning, of course, subjects would have to 
be chosen which had less than ten 
Years’ investigation, but it would be 
tasy to do this because, for instance, in 
matters of health, education, industry 
and agriculture, recreation and hous-

ing, .here is already a fairly good be- 
ginning of material.. In 1929 and 
1939, for instance, we might have a 
meeting devoted entirely to health, in 
which all of the studies made and 
available, should be presented and dis- 
cussed. After that the following prob- 
lems could be put on: 1930 and 1940, 
Education; 1931 and 1941, Industry 
and Agriculture; 1932 and 1942, 
Housing and Recreation; 1933 and 
1943, Law Observance and Adminis- 
tration; 1934 and 1944, Citizenship 
and the Suffrage; 1935 and 1945, Race 
and Race Relations. With the year 
1936, the question of health could 
again be taken up with seven years of 
additional study over 1929, and so on 
through the program. 

At each of the meetings, while the 
main topic which had received the in- 
tensive study for the period, would re- 
ceive the main part of the attention, 
one or two sessions might be given to a 
general survey of all conditions, in 
which new studies and new occurrences 
would be partially reported. The an- 
nual meetings could be in charge of the 
organization making the main study, 
with financial aid for the meeting from 
all member organizations. 

This was the plan that was con- 
ceived at Atlanta University. It could 
not be carried out there because we had 
only an annual appropriation of $5,000, 
which included our salaries and ex- 
penses. The scheme, therefore, had to 
be given up; but this would seem to be 
an unusually favorable time for re- 
drafting and improving the scheme and 
starting a study of group development 
and relations which would be unique 
in the history of the world, 


W. E. B. D. 


(Continued from page 58) 
On June 30th, 1928, he met his 


death on the job, accidentally, leaving 
a wife and three small girls with a 
great responsibility. 

Done by order of community with 
consent of his wife, Mrs. C. A. Mar- 
tin, who looks upon her husband’s 
work and sacrifice as just “service”. 
We look at it as “heroism”. 


He was born April 21, 1884. 


We have printed this letter as it 
came to us. It is the story of an hum- 
ble worker in a little Virginia town 
but it is a fine story and a fine life. 
Out of bits like this great races and 
great nations are built. 

We lift our hat and hand to the 
memory of Howard Martin.
