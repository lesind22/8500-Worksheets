Southern Aid Society 
of Va., Inc. 


3 announces with pleasure the granting 
Moers Nm a by the department of Banking and 
Tener Insurance of the State of New Jersey, 

of a license to conduct its business in that state. 


The requirements were— 
a Paid-up Capital of $150,000 
a Surplus of 75,000 
a deposit of 10,000 


in approved bonds, a Legal Reserve to cover outstanding policies and 
evidence of ability to conduct the insurance business on the high plane 
now required by all progressive states. In 2!l of these particulars this 
company was fully prepared to toe the mark. 


This step was in response to the invitation of hundreds of old policy- 
holders who have moved from Virginia and the South to that state, and 
who wanted to continue their Superior Three-in-One Insurance Protec- 
tion. These, and thousands of others will now have the opportunity to 


secure for One Small Premium, protection against Sickness, Disability 
and Death.

EDUCATION AND 
LIFE INSURANCE 


INCE 1916 the amount of Life Insurance in force in this country has increased from some 
eighteen billion to more than seventy-one billion dollars at the end of 1927—an increase of 
about four times in a single decade. While the number of people who have large amounts of 
insurance has increased more than proportionately the average policy at the end of 1927 was 
only about six hundred dollars more than the average policy a decade ago. This is a clear indi- 
cation that millions of people of small means, today, are buying life insurance who had, or who 
would have had, little appreciation of its value to them and their families a decade ago. 





This increase in appreciation of life insurance by common folk has been attributed in part 
to the action of the Government in selling life insurance to the soldiers in wartime. These men, 
and their families have, during the war and since, given thought to a form of investment for 
future benefits which many of them would never have considered seriously otherwise. The 
number of women employed today is vastly greater than a decade ago. Women are buying life 
insurance today, for themselves and their families, who were unable to make such investments 
then, or left the matter for the most part to the ‘“‘head” of the family. Every family has at 
least two heads nowadays. . ° 


As a result, a generation is now growing up to become the beneficiaries, through these thought- 
ful parents and other relatives, of almost four times the financial resources that would have 
been available to them under conditions that existed in 1916. Probably a better way to put it is 
that almost four times as many people are to share in financial resources, under the changed 
conditions of the past decade, that would otherwise have been available to comparatively few. 


At this season of the year when children are starting off to school again, thoughtful parents 
give added concern to Life Insurance as the only real means of providing definitely for the 
completion of high school and college, and a real start upon business or professional careers. 
Have you moved forward with the past decade, or is your family to be left in the 1916 class?

Ee CRISIS 





October, 1928 


OU’LL doubtless say that Phyllis 

dreamed it all. And it might 
have been a dream. It began this way. 
Phyllis was watching a clear stream. 
The water kept playing over vermilion 
and white and purplish pebbles and 
made them look very clean and cool. 
Phyllis thought of the poem about the 
water nymph and the boy and how the 
nymph had drawn the child into the 
pool. Dreadful! 

She hurried her thoughts on to 
something else. “I’ve known rivers,” 
she recalled lines from a poem by 
Langston Hughes that her elders had 
repeated, “Ancient dusky rivers.” She 
knew what “ancient” meant, but 
“dusky”, what did that mean? Dusky? 

The little summer winds in the 
water willows blew softly and a bee, 
gold barred like a royal bee from Italy, 
kept humming near her. After that— 
What did “dusky” mean? 

Phyllis found herself at a great en- 
trance. At first it seemed to be the 
hollow of a huge tree. Indeed | think 
it was a tree toad that met her at the 
threshold with a tart demand, “Are 
you looking for data?” 

“Data?” Phyllis gasped. 

“Never mind, I see you don’t know 
anything about it. Come in.” 

Phyllis obeyed and seemed as she 
went through the opening to see walls 
hung with bats upside down as these 
creatures fix themselves for winter in 
tree hollows. Then the bats became dull 
bronze sconces. And the one or two 
owls on the walls were doubtless stuf- 
fed birds, Phyllis thought. “What is 
this place?” she asked. 

“House of Hark Back,” came a 
voice from no living thing that she 
could see unless it could have been one 
of the owls. “And the entrance fee,” 
went on the voice, “is a thought. Only 
people who think can come in here. 

f what were you thinking?” 

“Rivers and runlets? Yes, rivers 
and runlets.”’ 

“Rivers and runlets’?” Sure 
enough, it was one of the large owls 
speaking. “Oh, then it’s data you 
want. The tree toad at the door—he’s 
grouchy enough—may have mumbled 
something against data. Data and 
Warts furnish him something to grum- 
ble about. But reason ought to tell 
him that a House of Hark Back is the 
Very place to which to come for ‘data. 
Let me call Mary’s Lamb.” 

: Mary's?” Phyllis gasped, wonder- 
ing if she was about to see that well 
known creature. 


House of Hark Back 


A Tale for Young Folk 


By EFFIE LEE NEWSOME 





Sarah E. Carter, Texas 


The owl gave a piercing cry. “Yes,” 
beginning again to talk to Phyllis, 
“after the way it’s worked all these 
ages, seems only reasonable that it 
should have a little rest in the House 
of Hark Back, when they will allow it 
to rest! Some one is always calling it 
out. Mary’s Lamb”—the lamb en- 
tered—‘‘that holds the honorary post 
of keeper of parchments in this the 
House of Hark Back.” Evidently the 
owl was presenting Mary’s Lamb. 

It was white to Phyllis’s amazement 
and not stone gray like most of the 
lambs that she had seen. 

“Now you want data, you say, on 
rivers?” the owl went on while Mary’s 
Lamb waited as it had waited on 
Mary. 

“T don’t know now,” Phyllis re- 
plied growing weary of the persistent 
owl. “I’d just been thinking some- 
thing from a piece called ‘The Negro 
Speaks of Rivers’, I believe. I forget.” 

“Oh, ‘The Negro Speaks of Rivers’? 
That would come under the record of 
darker peoples. Suppose I call Aben 
Hamet. Chateaubriand the great 
French writer created him. He is a 
Moor of long ago. The Spaniards, 
you know, drove the Moors from mag- 
nificent Granada. But Aben Hamet 
continued to go back over the water 
again and again to Granada.” 

“But why did Aben Hamet go 
back ?” 


’ 


“For two reasons,’ the owl said. 
“One of these was because every- 
where in Granada he could find mar- 
velous monuments in fret work and 
tower that his people the Moors had 
placed there. He loved to see them. 
Aben Hamet is a prominent figure 
here in the House of Hark Back. Here 


he is.” 


In walked Aben Hamet, a slender 
graceful man with rich tinted skin and 
dark hair and eyes. 

“Was it an Italian painter, da Vinci, 
Aben Hamet, who studied and loved 
the course of waters? Tell this child, 
please,” suggested the owl. 

“Leonardo da Vinci was ever in- 
terested in hydraulics. But this little 
girl”—he turned to Phyllis who had 
never seen any one more graceful— 
“might want to know that there was 
once in old Egypt a man with a 
strange name, C-T-E-S-I-B-I-U-S. He 
it was who centuries ago invented that 
branch of engineering science that is 
known as hydraulics.” 


“That’s another terrible word,” 
Phyllis cried. “And what does it 


mean ?” 


“Hydraulics?” asked Aben Hamet 
with a pleasant smile. “The regula- 
tion of liquid motion to laws and the 
application of these laws to marine en- 
gineering.” 

“But I would rather talk with 
Mary’s Lamb. I think Mary’s Lamb 
didn’t go inside the school. And per- 
haps it will not be too wise for me to 
understand.” 

Aben Hamet smiled again. “Yet I 
have told you something that it would 
be well for you to pin to your mind. 
A man of dark skin invented that 
science which keeps the fair skinned 
man’s world rushing forward. Call 
Mary’s Lamb. But hereafter when- 
ever you happen to hear the gurgle of 
waters remember what Aben Hamet 
has told you: A man heard waters 
gurgle in old Egypt and made them 
force.” 

Aben Hamet swept softly away. And 
Phyllis began calling, ““Mary’s Lamb! 
Mary’s Lamb!” The words seemed 
strangely hard to say. She was trying 
with all her might. But was she not 
only gurgling after all? 

Then something happened. Phyllis 
opened her eyes. You're right if you 
guessed that she had been asleep. She 
was sitting against a great oak that 
had a hollow on the other side. And 
not far beneath Phyllis’s toes that

“October is the darling of the year.” 
—Dunbar 

























HIS issue of THe Crisis, the 
Children’s Number, is for the 
month of nature’s most interesting 


changes, October. Trees become ra- 
diant with orange, yellow and crimson. 
The indescribably interesting migra- 
tions of birds take place. The creatures 
of woods find their winter homes. Corn 
shocks in the fields are brown neigh- 
bors to great golden pumpkins that 
often remind us of the festival of All 
Saints, the eve of the vigil of All Hal- 
lows, Halloween. 

And yet if you and I had lived cen- 
turies ago in Rome we might have been 
planning for the festival of the horse. 
In ancient days many celebrations oc- 
curred in October. But none equaled 
the occasion of the great Roman sacri- 
fice to the god Mars. A horse that 
wis called October would be offered 
up with elaborate ceremony to the god 
ot war, Mars, most dreaded of the 
upper gods. 

October with the Romans was orig- 
inally the eighth month in the “year 
of Romulus” which began with March. 
But the father of Romulus, according 
to myth, changed the opening of the 
year to January. And October be- 
came the tenth month, though the orig- 
inal name meant eight. Efforts were 
made to alter October to Invectus, 
Fectinus, other names. But October 
comes to us still branded as though it 
ranked eighth in the march of months.

early production of the very young 
poet, we learn, had a wonderful ef- 
fect in changing the literature of Rus- 
sia to a simplicity in style that would 
later mean the triumph of Tolstoy and 
Turgenieff. 

“With this tale the modern Russian 
literature—simple, realistic in its de- 
scriptions, modest in its images and 
fable, earnest and slightly humoristic 
—was created.” Pushkin as a child 
loved to listen to his grandmother and 
his.nurse telling thrilling tales of Rus- 
sia, and even as a man, when compelled 
by circumstances to. return to his coun- 
try estate, he there eagerly heard the 
many folk stories of his old nurse and. 
came to an appreciation of the force of 
simplicity in expression. The genius 
of reformation in Russian literature, 
“so the world pronounced this playful, 
crimpy-haired young man who had te- 
ceived the portrait of his teacher.

HE building and opening of the 

Paul Laurence Dunbar Apart- 
ments in the Negro quarter of New 
York City, is a striking step. In all 
American cities, the housing of the Ne- 
gro population has ever been a prob- 
lem, sometimes dormant, sometimes 
acute. In the large Northern cities, like 
Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Pitts- 
burgh, Philadelphia and New York, 
it was rendered acute by the World 
War, when the stoppage of foreign 
immigration led employers to import 
Negro labor from the South. 


The question as to where these new- 
comers were to live was a difficult 
one. It was doubly difficult because, 
before this time, all kinds of attempts 
at segregation and legal and illegal 
ghettos had been made. In Harlem 
there were numbers of efforts to keep 
Negroes out of the district altogether, 
to confine them to the area above 
135th Street and east of Lenox Ave- 
nue, and other districts. The Negroes 
won the fight by out-bidding the white 
laborers in rents, by buying isolated 
properties at strategic points, and, after 
the War, by taking title to millions 
of dollars worth of apartment house 
property. 


UT the process was socially very 
costly. Rents were high, not for 
the accommodations received, but as 
compared with the income of the col- 
ored people paying them; those buying 
could not buy single houses because 


October, 1928 


The Housing of Harlem 


By ALFRED ALEXANDER 





land in Manhattan is too costly for 
the single house. They must, there- 
fore, combine their resources to buy 
whole apartments. This called for 
bank credit and bank credit all the 
New York banks refused on direct ap- 
peal. Indirectly, however, they were 
forced to make loans through brokers 
and these brokers made the burden for 


The Paul Laurence Dunbar Apartments 


the payment of the interest and brok- 
erage amount, in many cases, almost to 
confiscation. 

Thus the landlords, new and old, 
colored and white, were caught be- 
tween two millstones: they must pay 
compound interest -and large bonuses 
and they were dealing with careless 
untrained tenants, who misused their 
property, paid rent irregularly, and 
spoiled neighborhoods by dirt and 
noise. Manifestly a weeding out proc- 
ess of the decent and indecent, the re- 
liable workers and the noisy wastrels 
was needed and was hindered by race 
prejudice and. the war rent laws. What 
was needed then was stabilization and 
the setting of standards for a segre- 
gated group which was refused such 
social service by the general commun- 
ity. 


HE new laws and banking cus- 

toms which encouraged coopera- 
tive buying of apartments opened the 
door and a considerable number of such 
apartments are now being bought by 
the better class of colored people. But 
here, too, difficulties were encountered. 
Banks still refused capital and credit on 
reasonable terms, and this enabled 
agencies to boost prices far above the 
real market. Again it was difficult to 
pick out ten, twenty, or thirty. colored 
families who would cooperate punctu- 
ally and honestly and submit themselves 
to common rules. Only a few Ne- 
groes saw the necessity of self-imposed 
regulations and business promptness.

Thus, two delinquent or careless fami- 
lies in a twenty apartment house would 
often utterly ruin an otherwise suc- 
cessful project. 

Into this situation came the Rocke- 
feller experiment. Many agencies had

from time to time appealed to John D. 
Rockefeller, Jr., and other philanthro- 
pists to “help” colored people in busi- 
ness lines. They were for a long time 
rather puzzled as to what could be 
done outside of helping Southern edu- 


cation. They were probably warned 
that a housing experiment would fail 
because of the difficulties of securing @ 
site and because of Negroes’ lack of 
thrift. Mr. Rockefeller was, neverthe- 
less, induced to make the experiment.

The original suggestion came from 
Mr. Rockefeller himself and was con- 
sidered by an invited group of repre- 
sentatives from the colored Y. M. C. 
A, Y. W. C. A., and the Urban 
League. He bought a whole block, 
from 149th to 150th Streets and from 
Seventh to Eighth Avenues in Harlem 
and erected a set of ten connecting 
buildings. The block contains 150,320 
square feet. The area of the build- 
ings is 74,764 square feet, or 49.7% 
of the ground area. ‘The architect, 
Andrew J. Thomas, had had experi- 
ence in erecting apartments for folk 
of moderate means. He made the 
buildings, first of all, beautiful,—not 
gaudy and over-loaded with orna- 
mentation—but built with brick of 
warm color and soft texture, in well- 
proportioned masses, with sparing use 
of carving and wrought iron. He left 
a great space in the center open for 
grass, trees, shrubbery and a play- 
ground, building the dwellings but 
two rooms deep, and disposing them 
so as to make a series of wings and 
towers which concealed the fire escapes 
and gave a pleasing vista. 

The buildings are erected on rock 
and concrete piles with foundations of 
tubblestone. The first floor is fire- 
proof with steel beams and concrete 
arches. Other floors have steel beams 
supported by Lally columns and ex- 
terior walls with intermediate wooden 
beams. The hallways are all fireproof 
throughout and enclosed with eight 
inches of brickwork. The entire peri- 
meter of the exterior of the buildings 
consists of Holland face-brick with 
ornamental details of limestone and

walls at the roof of architectural terra 
cotta, 

The buildings are heated with a 
low pressure steam heating system sup- 
plied by Smith cast iron boilers. Each 
building is treated as an individual 
unit, having its own boiler. The hot 
water system is separate from the heat- 
ing, and like the heating each building 
is treated independently. All branch 
lines of the water supply are of brass. 

In the construction of the stairhalls 
slate is used for the platforms, land- 
ings, and treads, face brick for the 
walls. The doors leading to the apart- 
ments are fireproof kalamein. These 
doors are equipped with Ackerman 
door interviewers. 

There is a large playground in the 
center of the garden for the small chil- 
dren, equipped with slides, see-saws, 
sand piles, gymnasium apparatus, etc. 
This playground is equipped with 
drinking fountains and toilets for boys 
and girls. In addition, there are two 
nurseries adjacent to the playground. 


HE result was an astonishing suc- 
cess. The house received the 
American Institute of Architecture’s 
first prize for 1927. Perhaps.for the 
first time in the life of the Negro in 
America, here is an enterprise which 
with all its philanthropy has essayed 
and succeeded in being beautiful. The 
deliberate ugliness which has been 
thrust upon American Negroes in the 
past,—upon a group peculiarly suscept- 
ible to beauty of color and form,—is 
astonishing. These apartments came 
as a pleasant change.

ing about seven by ten feet, the dining 
rooms, eleven by twelve, the living 
and bed rooms, ten by eleven, thirteen 
or fifteen feet. The ceilings are eight 
feet, one inch high, and the decorations 
and finishings are simple, but good. 
There is, of course, electricity, hot and 
cold water, wash tubs and gas ranges, 
refrigerators and dumb waiters. The 
buildings are five and six stories high 
without elevators or roof gardens, but 
with wide brick entries and iron stair- 
ways and flagged landings. 

The method of financing this proj- 
ect is as follows: no attempt has been 
made to take advantage of tax exemp- 
tion. The buildings were erected at 
an actual cost of land and building in- 
cluding architect’s fees, insurance and 
taxes during construction, together 
with 5% interest on the money which 
was advanced, of $3,330,000. No 
charge was included for financing 
other than 5% interest nor was any 
charge made for the services of Mr. 
Rockefeller’s staff in developing the 
whole project. These services are be- 
ing continued without charge, includ- 
ing a large amount of bookkeeping and 
other statistical work. 

Tenants only can be stockholders, 
and stockholders only can be tenants. 
The tenants are required to subscribe 
for such an amount of stock as repre- 
sents the cost of the apartment which 
they select. The down payment called 
for $50. per room, that is, for a three 
room apartment, $150. or for the larg- 
est apartment, namely, a seven room 
apartment, a $350 down payment 
must be made. The six and seven

OR several years after the World 

War I used to talk concerning 
the results of the War, and to say that 
notwithstanding the slaughter and the 
upheaval that always accompany war 
we were going to have in the world an 
extension of democracy as a result of 
the fighting; that the democracy which 
formerly had ruled in restricted fields 
—in the election of officials, in the so- 
called political world—we were going 
to see extended into industry, so that 
in regard to work and wages and in- 
come, we were going to have democratic 
control. But I write today to apolo- 
gize and change my thesis. I was 
wrong in what I was predicting. I 
see today without any doubt that in- 
stead of the great question of democ- 
racy being an extension of democratic 
control into further territory, the prob- 
lem that faces us in America and faces 
the world is the question as to whether 
we can keep the territory which we 
thought democracy had already con- 
quered; that, as a matter of fact, in 
every single culture country there is 
today a fight to retain democracy, and 
that reaction and oligarchy are begin- 
ning to hold up their heads in the 
world and to triumph. Moreover, 
here in the United States, here where 
we have essayed the greatest experi- 
ment in democracy, we have perhaps 
the greatest failure. 


OTHING could show this more 

than the present presidential 
campaign. There are momentous 
questions: the plight of American agri- 
culture, the monopoly of water power, 
the role of organized wealth in indus- 
try, the future of organized labor, the 
distribution of national income. Most 
of these important questions we are 
not facing in this campaign. Why? 
Because the average voter does not 
understand how to face them. He 
finds himself vainly pawing the air in 
the so-called elections. He finds that 
he cannot exercise democratic control 
because he is not free to vote. 


In the September Crisis I showed 
how, where and why American Ne- 
groes were not free to vote. But how 
about white. Americans? Are they 
disfranchised ? 

It might be assumed that the practi- 
cal disfranchisement of the great ma- 
jority of Negroes chiefly by race and 
not by condition had no effect upon 
the state and nation, but simply upon 
them; but the singular thing is, and 
the point which this paper is seeking to 
emphasize, that this disfranchisement

of the Negro has had an astonishing 
effect on the voting of other persons 
in the states concerned and in the 
whole nation so far as the mass of 
voters is concerned. 


IRST, in the Southern states it en- 

courages oligarchy. Secondly, it 
enables cliques: to nullify, not simply 
the 14th and 15th Amendments, but 
the 19th Amendment, giving the right 
vote to women, And finally, it en- 
tirely vitiates the normal distribution 
of voting power throughout the nation 
and makes a third party impossible. 
Let us take these points up in order. 


One of the most interesting state- 
ments on clique government in the 
South comes from Henry W. Ander- 
son, a rich white Virginia politician, 
who spoke at the Institute of Public 
Affairs held at the University of Vir- 
ginia, August 19, 1927: 


“The Negroes were disfranchised. 
The Negro vote has since been so small 
that it is no longer a material factor 
in the political situation. But the 
process of disfranchisement did not 
stop there. The machinery of dis- 
crimination, devised primarily for this 
purpose, was then employed by the 
dominant party organization to effect 
a disqualification of a large proportion 


of the white population opposed to that 
organization, while unchallenged con- 
trol of one political group permitted or 
encouraged political corruption. As 4 
result of these measures the vote quali- 
fied or cast in the Southern States has 
been so reduced that it includes only a 
small minority of the population. Spo 
small is this vote that the State and 
local office-holders constitute or easily 
control a majority. Governors and 
other state officers are sometimes 
elected by less than 10 per cent of the 
population of voting age.” 

Let us see how far we can illustrate 
this state of affairs by figures: we will 
take eleven Southern states—Virginia, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, 
Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and 
Texas. We have the following facts 
as to the increase of population and of 
voting population in the presidential 
elections.

HE population in these states in- 

creased over 200 per cent since 
1870, but the voting population has 
increased only 131% over 1872, de- 
spite woman suffrage. If we compare 
the population 1890-1920 and the 
voters 1892-1920, we find the popula- 
tion has increased 75% and the voters 
42% despite the doubling of the elec- 
torate by woman suffrage. In other 
words, we have in the South today not 
only a nullification of the 15th but also 
of the 19th Amendment. 

Moreover, the increase of voting 
from 1904 to 1924 is mainly in North 
Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas. If 
we take the five states of Alabama, 
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and 
South Carolina, we have this result:

THE BROWSING READER 


DARK PRINCESS 
Dark Princess, a Romance by W. E. 
Burghardt Du Bois. _ Harcourt, 
Brace and Co., N. Y. $2.00. 


OTHING at last can defeat the 

Negro but meanness of spirit; 
nothing can save him but the courage 
to enter his fiery furnace. It is as if 
three centuries had made him a flex- 
ible, Toledo blade for this century to 
test. Let it now flash and strike, if its 
steel be true. Courage is the real 
theme of Dark Princess, courage em- 
phasized by symbols which are more 
representative than any yet chosen 
from Negro life. 

We are abject, we are apologetic. 
In our society, in the crowded, every- 
day world, in the work we do, every- 
where we jeer and scoff at ourselves. 
We need some vision of the unre- 
leased possiblities of our natures, some 
higher confidence to stir us to great 
aims. We have had enough of de- 
precating and hedging. Ultimately it 
kills the spirit, it gives us life without 
purpose and dedication. We are be- 
come unworthy of the dignity and 
spiritual fire of our ancestors who were 
slaves in body alone. 

McKay has been a clarion voice in 
our literature, says Mr. Thurman, be- 
cause he only is aggressive in spirit. 
But I suspect Mr. Thurman is un- 
critical in praising mere desperate 
bravado. The courage of the Negro, 
like all courage of all peoples, is based 
on a wise and enduring spirit. It is 
rooted in suffering. Courage and the 
discipline of sorrow must be equally 
effective in moulding the new Negro. 
There is a great suffering behind us. 
We should be unified by this common 
tragedy. It is this last note which 
makes Dark Princess a sane and bal- 
anced work, purged of any rash and 
strident “aggressiveness”. In fact, Dr. 
Du Bois has revealed the futility of 
mere “protest” and “aggressiveness” by 
the satiric but tragic portrait of Peri- 
gua, who ended by blowing himself 
out of the “problem” with dynamite, 
while the Kluxers he meant to kill 
were unhurt. 


bor author wants an energy and 
a courage which are based upon 
the Negro’s terrible suffering. Mat- 
thew Towns sets the double theme of 
courage and the chastening of sorrow 
at the very beginning of the novel. He 
is tempted to answer the Indian who 
contemptuously places the Negro

among “the lower classes’, by boasting 
of mythical African dynasties, and of 
the mixed blood in our Southern aris- 
tocracy. “I reckon,” he began—then 
something changed within him. It was 
as if he had faced and made a decision, 
as though some great voice, crying and 
reverberating within his soul, spoke for 
him and yet was him—‘I reckon 
you're right. We American blacks are 
very common people. My grandfather 
was a whipped and driven slave; my 
father was never really free and died 
in jail. My mother plows and washes 
for a living. We come out of the 
depths—the blood and mud of battle. 
And from just such depths, I take it, 
came most of the worth-while things 
in this old world.” 

Since the rise of our Negro school 
of beauty and pure emotion, repre- 
sented perfectly, I suppose, in the easy 
savagery of Home to Harlem, no catch- 
word has been used so devastatingly 
against everything intellectual and 
purposeful as the catch-word, “prop- 
aganda”. Certainly Dr. Du Bois is a 
propagandist, as many of his critics di- 
vine. He has raised the dead weight 
of our stolid depression by propaganda 
at once eloquent and sane. He has 
spoken both to our spirits and to our 
intellects. There have been both fire 
and light in him. Propaganda, I take 
it, is in his case the bringing to the 
people of inspiration and energy ordin- 
arily beyond their reach. What he 
must sacrifice in artistry, he gains for 
this purpose and this time in stimulat- 
ing the soul of a great people. What 
is the truth of the crv of “art for art’s 
sake”? The English novel abounds 
in propagandists, including two of its 
greatest figures, Richardson and 
Dickens. And what of Harriet 
Beecher Stowe? With all its prop- 


| 


te 


agandic fire, Uncle Tom’s Cabin re- 
mains great in theme and emotional 
power. It would be false to say that 
Richardson and Dickens are great in 
spite of their propaganda, because their 
propaganda is the very spirit of their 
genius, their driving force. There are 
critics who would measure all art by 
one yard-stick. Dark Princess must be 
evaluated as a representative panorama 
of the spiritual influence in Negro life, 
with a propagandic purpose, if you 
please. 


HAVE said that Dark Princess is 

representative. The characters of 
Matthew, his mother, Jimmie, Sammy 
Scott, and Perigua are all related to a 
normal center of Negro experience, 
and the Indian princess is brought 
into similar relation by the chastening 
of work and suffering which she un- 
dergoes. Sara Andrews, however, is 
the center of the book. Sara is more 
significant than any character yet 
drawn from Negro life, Porgy in- 
cluded. For Sara is what our aspira- 
tions seem to be. She is smooth and 
worldly and almost white. She is 
sensitive neither to the strengthening 
tragedy of our past, nor to fire and 
beauty in our souls to-day. She repre- 
sents all that Negro middle class, 
which fails to perceive the divine hu- 
man nature in Negroes, which scorns 
the soul of its own people, and tries to 
shut itself off in a world of comfort 
and relaxation. Smooth, clever, hard, 
selfish, and comfortable, is not Sara 
what we want to be, if we can get the 
education and social status? What 
has she to do with the depths out of 
which we come, “the blood and mud 
of battle’\—or with a mother who 
“plows and washes for a living?” 

It is she who is ignoble, not they 
who daily need to raise their spirit 
above the sense of defeat, above dis- 
ease and penury. The class she typifies 
is killing its dignity and its vision by 
selfish comfort and detachment. High 
hopes and aims, and a sense of great 
adventure are being born in the ficry 
South among the people they scorn. In 
Sara Andrews and her Chicago set, 
or their counterparts in any section of 
the Negro bourgeoise, is the real mean- 
ness of spirit. Their compromising 
and truckling to the white world of 
power, their exploiting of the common 
Negro, and more than all else, their 
lack of vision and confidence in their 
highest human abilities is degrading, is 
inner death.

The portrait of Sara is made by an 
artist in fiction. The treatment of the 
life of the Pullman porter and of the 
Chicago politician is a re-creation of 
new and generally significant portions 
of Negro life. There are two care- 
fully prepared and forceful climatic 
scenes; one on the train hurtling to- 
ward the dynamite set by Perigua, the 
other at Sara’s reception to the politi- 
cal leaders of Chicago who are agreed 
on Matthew’s election to Congress. 
The style varies naturally with the 
symbolic and realistic material, and is 
a credit to one already recognized as 
“a master of modern, English prose.” 


HE novel’s chief virtue, however, 

lies in the mergence of a central 
theme. Matthew Towns is drawn be- 
tween cowardice and courage, and the 
struggle is ennobling. Courage proves 
to be courage to sacrifice self. It is 
natural that Dr. Du Bois should have 
chosen this theme, for his own struggle 
for years past must have been to be- 
lieve in the Negro’s spirit and man- 
hood. Are we soft and pleasure-loving, 
or are we tempered like fine steel? Peri- 
gua, the anarchist, expresses our own 
recurrent doubts: “We're tame tab- 
bies; we’re fawning dogs; we lick and 
growl and wag our tails; we’re so glad 
to have a white man fling us swill that 
we wiggle on our bellies and crawl. 
We slave that they may loll; we hand 
over our daughters to be their prosti- 
tutes—We're afraid, we're scared; 
we're congenital idiots and cowards. 
Don’t tell me, you fool—I know you 
and your kind. Your caution is cow- 
ardice inbred for ten generations; you 
want to talk, talk, talk and argue until 
somebody in pity and contempt gives 
you what you dare not take.” 


ERLGUA is wrong, as McKay is 
wrong in “If we must die—”. 
Our “caution” is not cowardice, any 
more than our laughter is childishness. 
The Negro is an Oriental in philos- 
ophy and spirituality. He ought not to 
prod himself into American “‘pep” and 
“aggressiveness ’. Endurance and 
fortitude are the foundation for the 
higher courage we now want. We 
shall not be weakened by a slavish love 
of life, if we fight as valiantly against 
misfortune and hardship as our fore- 
bears have. The fighter whom we 
honor is not the crusher, the slashing 
tiger, but the. man who takes the 
hardest blows and keeps coming back, 
who refuses to be knocked out. And 
life itself demands just this ability to 
take sorrow and misfortune without 
bitterness, and likewise without loss of 
spirit,—just this wisdom of sorrow to- 
gether with this persistent and higher 
energy. 
In a class of college students in lit- 
erature, I recenly found that none had 
read any book by McKay, Du Bois, 


340 


Cullen, Hughes, Johnson, 
Green, Peterkin, Adams, O’Neill, 
Heyward,.or Qdum. Indifference to- 
ward Negro literature is a general con- 
dition, not only among our college 
students, but throughout our whole 
bourgeoise. The Emperor Jones was 
laughed off the boards in Washington 
and in Harlem. Negroes who have 
the money to buy books and the intelli- 
gence to read them are not interested 
in the literature of Negro life. Con- 
sequently Negro books are written for 
white readers, just as Negro schools 
are run for white patrons, and Negro 
spirituals are sung in New York to 
please white audiences. Dark Princess 
will not appeal to the same public 
which enjoyed Nigger Heaven and 
Home to Harlem. All those who have 
a high faith in the destiny and nature 
of the Negro, therefore, ought to read 
it.

the American Negro. By Arthur

HAT shall our children read? 

This is a puzzling query for 
colored mothers and fathers. Quite 
naturally, most of the books tell about 
white people and this, together with 
what they learn in school and in the 
newspapers, brings the unspoken as- 
sumption that everything that has been 
done in this world worth while, has 
been done by white people. We can- 
not attack this natural conclusion by 
dogmatic assertion to the contrary, but 
we can put Arthur Fauset’s book into 
the hands of young people. “It is told 
in the spirit of young folk because they 
more than any of us, perhaps, are able 
to re-live the lives and struggles of 
heroic characters with that innocence 
and fidelity of interpretation which 
are so essential to a true understanding 


of the elements which underlie human’ 


aspiration.” 

There are twenty-one very short 
chapters telling about slavery, Crispus 
Attucks, Phillis Wheatley, the Negro 
soldiers in the Revolutionary and other 
wars, Benjamin Banneker, Sojourner 
Truth, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. 
Washington and others. Then there 
is something about Negro singers and 
contemporary writers and poets. It is 
an excellent book, clearly written and 
it ought to be in all our libraries, par- 
ticularly where there are children.

IN THE MAGAZINES 


ARVEY C. LEHMAN and 
Paul A. Witty, a couple of eru- 
dite professors from Ohio University 





and the University of Kansas, report 
their findings in “Some Compensatory 
. T ’ . 

Mechanisms of the Negro” in the 
Journal of Abnormal and Social Psy. 
chology for April-June, 1928. The 
study is based on the hypothesis that 
“an individual who realizes he is de- 
ficient in one field. sets out to conceal 
that incapacity by training his ability 
in another direction”. And so the 
good professors conclude that Negro; 
children participate in church actiyj- 
ties, playing school, writing poetry, 
social activities, and particularly box- 
ing—boxing only requiring ° brute 
force, ability to stand bestial pummel- 
ling and a modicum of intelligence— 
with more frequency than white chil- 
dren because these activities symbolize 
a knowledge, power, and prestige 
which Negroes are unable to discover 
in actuality! ’ 

E. Franklin Frazier discusses “Sex 
Morality Among Negroes” quite 
frankly in Religious Education for 
May. Mr. Frazier says that to cor- 
relate the sex behavior of the Negro 
with his African inheritance is barren 
speculation, because the morality of 
the Negro in this country has grown 
out of his experience in America. 

Dixon Meritt sends us a letter 
from the “New South” in Outlook 
for August 8. Mr. Merritt says, in 
writing about “Politics and the South- 
‘ern Negro”, that the time has passed 
when the Negro is blindly devoted to 
the Republican Party. In the coming 
election, he seems oblivious to partisan 
differences between Democrats and 
Republicans, and is giving very little 
support to either. After discussing the 
unscrupulous political manipulators 
and “other pusillanimous phases of our 
politics”, Mr. Merritt concludes his 
letter by asking: “Who can blame a 
self-respecting Negro for keeping out 
of it?” a 

America, a Catholic weekly review, 
carries “The Unknown Field of Negro 
History” by John LaFarge, who tells 
of the aims of the Journal of Negro 
History, edited by Carter Woodson. 
Mr. LaFarge says: “In view of the 
efforts put forth by the Association for 
the Study of Negro History to set 
forth all the facts impartially and 
without the trace of ulterior motive, 
it would seem that it deserves the co- 
operation of Catholics as well as of 
the many non-Catholics who have al- 
ready interested themselves in_ this 
work.” 

There is a simple grandeur con- 
nected with the ritual of “Crowning 
a Gold Coast Potentate”, according 
to Alexander Reynolds in Travel for 
August. He tells the story of a race 
of men, whose slim, black bodies are 
models of symmetry and grace, and of

The Late Bishop Delaney 


HE Reverend Henry B. Delany 

was born February 5, 1858, the 
son of Thomas Sterling Delany and 
Sarah L. Delany. He was the young- 
est child in a family of twelve. His 
father, a Negro freeman, was a car- 
penter and ship builder. His mother, 
a slave, was a full-blooded African 
from the West Coast. 

He was born at St. Marys, Georgia, 
but during the Civil war, he and the 
entire family being slaves, by reason 
of the marriage of his father with a 
slave, escaped across the St. Marys 
River into Fernandina, Florida, which 
was at that time occupied by Union 
forces. ‘This escape was a memorable 
event in his life and was attended by 
no little danger. The crossing was 
accomplished in a boat by means of 
muffled oars. 

Fernandina, Florida, thereafter be- 
came the home of the family. He re- 
ceived his earliest educational training 
from one of his elder sisters, Mary, 
who though born in slavery, had never- 
theless, because of her aptitude for 
learning, been secretly instructed. 

He later attended the Freedman’s 
School in Fernandina. From an early 
age he was musically inclined and was 
the leader of the town band and the 
organist for the Methodist Church. He 
early showed signs of devout religious 
leanings and joined the Methodist 
Church. It was at this time that he 
attracted the attention of the Reverend 
Dr. Thackara who persuaded him to 
give up his trade, that of a brick mason, 
and study for the ministry. No finan- 
cial aid was offered by Dr. Thackara, 
but encouragement that was sincere. 

At this time he had already received

what would correspond to a High 
School training. Thus at the age of 
twenty-three he left Fernandina and 


Cornelia and ee Lampkin 
a. 


eritered St. Augustine’s Normal and 
Collegiate Institute at Raleigh, N. C. 
He graduated from the Collegiate De- 
partment of the Institution in 1885, 
having established what was consid- 
ered a brilliant scholastic record, and 
he was an efficient Latin and Greek 
scholar. 


Upon graduation he was immediately 
appointed a teacher of Latin and Greek 
in the school. It was at this time that 
he completed his studies for the min- 
istry in the Episcopal Church, St. 
Augustine’s, being at that time a 
theological school. 


N the same class with him was Nan- 

nie James Logan, who was the 
valedictorian of her class. She later 
became his wife on Oct. 6, 1896 and 
was a teacher thereafter in the school 
until she resigned in June, 1927. 


On January 7, 1889 he was or- 
dained Deacon in St. Ambrose Church, 
Raleigh, N. C. In 1891 he was or- 
dained as priest in the same Church. 


In addition to his work as a teacher 
in the school he was Chaplain of St. 
Augustine’s Chapel, the Church con- 
nected with the school. During the 
summer months he was Superintendent 
of the school, and actively supervised 
and took part in the erection of addi- 
tional buildings for the school. When 
it was decided that St. Agnes Hospital 
was to be built, he opened a quarry on 
the lands belonging to the school and 
quarried the rock from which St. 
Agnes Hospital was built, and actively 
aided and supervised its building. 


He was later made Vice Principal of 
the School.

@ Young colored men often ask if 
there is an opening for Negroes in 
various lines of work and usually they 
are discouraged by hearing that there 
is very little chance for a Negro, even 
though he is trained, to become an 
engineer or an aviator or a bank of- 
ficial. Charles H. Dodge of San 
Diego, California, is an exception to 
the rule. Many years ago he attended 
Fisk University and then became a 
bank messenger in St. Louis. He 
served in this capacity for many years 
and then removed to San Diego where 
he became a collector for the Bank of 
Commerce and Trust Company. This 
bank was merged with the Southern 
Trust and Commerce Bank and finally 
was absorbed by the Bank of Italy. 
Today, Mr. Dodge is Currency Mail- 
ing Clerk in the bank and his daily 
count of half million dollars or more 
of currency is final. He has his own 
steel and locked compartment and has 
probably in the last twenty-five years 
handled more millions in actual cash 
than most millionaires. His integrity, 
kindliness and public service are known 
to everyone West of the Mississippi.

THE ACCEPTANCE SPEECHES 
CAREFUL comparison of the 


remarks of Messrs. Smith and 
Hoover in accepting their nominations 
to the presidency, reveal certain clear 
facts. 

One of the great issues before the 
American people is the treatment of 
black Americans: their wholesale dis- 
franchisement in the South, discrimina- 
tion against them in work, wages and 
dwelling places in the North, their 
lack of educational opportunities, and 
the lawlessness and lynching of which 
they are the victims. Concerning this 
momentous problem, Mr. Herbert 
Hoover spoke as follows: 


Eleven days later, Alfred Smith 
treated the same subject as follows: 


If it be objected that this report does 
not take into account certain statements 
which inferentially may cover the Ne- 
gro problem, we may say that Mr. 
Hoover said: 

“The Republican Party does deny 
the right of anyone to seek to disturb 
the purposes of the Constitution by in- 
direction.” And he adds: “That the 
Republican Party adds to the Revolu- 
tionary doctrine ‘that all men were 
created equal’ and all should have 
equality before the law, a third ideal: 
The ideal of equal opportunity.” He 
also declared that so far as the other 
countries are concerned “We have no 
hates, we wish no further possessions, 
we harbour no military threats.” 

Governor Smith declared that “‘in- 
terference in the purely internal affairs 
of Latin America must cease”. That 
“every race has made its contribution 
to the betterment of America”. And 
he added that “the impairment of the 
general regard and reverence for law 
was a mistake which was scarcely to be 
estimated”. 

Those Negroes who can find any- 
thing to get enthusiastic about in any 
of these statements are welcome to 


346 


Potlacuhl 










their enthusiasm. When Mr. Hoover 
spoke of enforcing the law, he did not 
mean the 14th and 15th Amendments; 
when he talked about equality, he was 
not thinking of the Negro. When Mr. 
Smith talks about law enforcement, he 
means liquor; and although he men- 
tioned Nicaragua, he did not mention 
Haiti. And there you are. 


HOW SHALL WE VOTE? 


6¢TIRST, I will say that I am a 

Black Man and live in the 
South and have lived here all of my 
life. Second, I am a Reader pf THE 
Crisis. I read every issue and in fact 
I find no fault with anything that you 
have advocated and I am now asking 
you some questions: 

“First. How should the Black Men 
of the South vote in this coming Presi- 
dential Election? Second. Should they 
vote for Hoover or should they vote 
for Smith? Third. Will the modi- 
fying of the Volstead Act change or 
have any effect on the 18th Amend- 
ment to the Constitution of the United 
States? Fourth. Will not the tam- 
pering with the Volstead Act lead to 
more desperate action on the part of 
those who really are enemies to the 
13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to 
the Constitution of the United States ?” 

Our answers follow: 

First. Black men of the South 
should not vote for Herbert Hoover be- 
cause he favors the Lily White domina- 
tion of the Republican Party in the 
South; because he has always been si- 
lent as to lynching; because he has 
stood for the subjugation of Haiti; and 
because he has done nothing and advo- 
cated nothing toward the enforcement 
of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amend- 
ments. 

Second. Negroes should not vote 
for Al Smith because in twenty-five 
years of public service he has never in 
any way recognized any Negro by ap- 
pointment or by assenting to laws 
which Negroes wished enacted; be- 
cause he is the running mate of an 
Arkansas Democrat who may succeed 
him to the Presidency; because he has 
made no protest against lynching and 
his political obligations to the South 
are such that the Negro cannot expect 
from him as President the slightest 
consideration af which the dominant 





bourbon South does not approve, 

Third. Both Smith and Hoover 
represent in their parties and organiza- 
tion, organized wealth, industrial 
monopoly, and the exploitation of the 
poor. 

Fourth. The Volstead Act could 
be modified without changing the 
18th Amendment. If the 18th 
Amendment were repealed, some per- 
sons might be encouraged to attempt 
the repeal of the 15th Amendment. It 
is doubtful if the corporations which 
have taken refuge under the 14th 
Amendment would elect the repeal of 
that law, and while many people would 
like the repeal of the 13th Amend- 
ment, the opposition of white labor 
would stop them. 

Fifth. If the Negro does not vote 
for Smith or Hoover, what should he 
do? He can vote for the candidate 
of the Third Party—for Norman 
Thomas, the candidate of the Social- 
ists, or for the Nominees of the Farm- 
er-Labor Group or the Prohibitionists, 
This will be in effect throwing a vote 
away, because no Third Party candi- 
date can be elected as long as the 
minority party can depend upon the 
rotten boroughs of the Solid South. 
Nevertheless, a vote for the Third 
Party in this election is a moral pro- 
test, and moral protests are of im- 
portance, even in the United States of 
America and in the year of Grace, 


1928. 


CHICAGO 


E may measure intelligence and 

count the number of homes 
owned and go over the list of Negro 
graduates, and yet be somewhat in 
doubt as to the advancement of the 
Negro race. But now and then there 
comes to our notice some sudden indi- 
cation of progress that is “the voice 
without reply”. 

I rode down South Parkway, Chi- 
cago, the other day. It was once 
Grand Boulevard. And there, where 
this great and newly redesigned artery 
of the greatest city of the West, 
swerves and widens to a park, men are 
building a statue. At night the statue 
is guarded—a black policeman to the 
left and a white one to the right. And 
the statue is one built to Chica70s 
black soldiers who fought in the Great

Crisis 






October, 1928 





347 


War and a Negro race and figure 
towers in its midst. Perhaps in itself 
it is not the greatest work of art; but 
ir is artistic; it is beautiful; and above 
all, it is tremendously significant. 

Here in the midst of the most typi- 
cal of American cities stands in stone, 
a black soldier. Why? Not because 
Chicago loves her Negroes so well, but 
because with their work, their educa- 
tion, their prosperity, and their poli- 
tical power, she must needs recognize 
the Truth at times. 


THE A. M. E. CONFERENCE 
TORIES are still current of an 


unprecedented use of money dur- 
ing the election of bishops in the late 
General Conference of the African 
M. E. Church, which was held in May 
in the city of Chicago. Exact facts 
are difficult to obtain but some testi- 
mony from an unimpeachable source 
has. come to us. 

“T do know that money was liberally 
used—that there was a ‘pot’ made up 
among certain candidates. I know it 
so well that you are at liberty to quote 
me as saying that the election of bishops 
was influenced principally by the 
shameful use of money.” 

Tue Crisis believes so thoroughly 
in the essential integrity and good in- 
tentions of the organized Negro church 
that it wants one of two things to take 
place and to take place quickly: either 
a thorough airing of the use of the 
inoney in the election of bishops in the 
A. M. E. church and steps toward im- 
mediate reform: or an effective denial 
and disproof of such allegations. 


PROTEST 


HERE are many legitimate reac- 

tions of the Negro to American 
race prejudice. Some may laugh it off 
by seeing the absurdity of it; some may 
ignore and live absorbed in their own 
groove alone with sea and sun and 
friends. Some may be silently indig- 
nant and some may shout their just 
resentment to the stars. 

Many persons accept every attitude 
except the last. They are perfectly 
willing that the Negro should laugh 
or keep to himself and be silent, no 
matter what he thinks. But that a 
black man should stand up openly and 
protest, is to them monstrous. They 
stress the undoubted efficacy of cynical 
humor; they give great weight to the 
unquestioned dignity and moral splen- 
dor of silent self-denial. But they are 
transported with wrath if a Negro 
openly complains and sees crimson 
when a white man pushes his face in 
mud. 

And yet in the history of the white 
world, what did modern peoples do to 
gain freedom for body and soul? They 
developed a few saints who went to 


348 


silent death for. a. Cause. But also 
they brought forth great prophets who 
cried aloud and spared not; who spoke 
with flaming tongue and made men 
understand the filth and evil they were 
doing. And without the trumpet tones 
of prophets many a meek martyr had 
died in vain. Die, Victim, die! but 
let’s not all die. Laugh, clown, laugh! 
but for God’s sake don’t let us all 


be clowns. 


OUR JUDGES 


VERY government tries to hedge 

some part of itself about with 
sacredness and infallibility, so as to put 
it beyond criticism. In England, it is 
the King, even though he is shorn of 
exact power. In Germany, it used to 
be the Emperor and the High Nobility ; 
and in the United States, it is the 
courts. Yet our courts are among the 
greatest dangers that assail democratic 
government. First of all, they repre- 
sent, by appointment, by education, 
and by contact, the rich, the well edu- 
cated, the privileged, the employers. 
Secondly, by tradition and by actual 
law, they are above the law. A Lou- 
isiania judge, sitting in New York, 
impudently and openly defies the 13th, 
14th and 15th Amendments, and brow- 
beats a respectable lawyer with im- 
munity as certain as that of a French 
executive officer under Louis XIV. 
Repeatedly, magistrates, sitting in 
great cities, have threatened their vic- 
tims with lynching or regretted that 
they were not in Mississippi where 
lynchings are more common. War- 
rants are issued for ridiculous offences 
and injunctions are being used to stop 
strikes and prevent the publication of 
newspapers. And all this is because 
our courts are sacred; because they 
cannot be criticized; and because we 
must jump up with bared heads and 
kow-tow when a Judge seats himself 
upon his throne. 


DRUNKENNESS 
OTHING 


clearly the limitations of half- 
baked minds than the present discus- 
sion in the United States concerning 


demonstrates more 


liquor. We are not, in fact, discuss- 
ing liquor at all. We are discussing 
laws. Laws depend for their enforce- 
ment upon public opinion, whether 
they are enacted by the United States 
or states or counties or cities. There 
was a day—lI remember its beginning 
—when, in the matter of consuming 
alcoholic liquors, we concentrated our 
attack upon this opinion of the public. 
We said to young men and young 
women: “Strong drink is raging and 
whosoever is deceived thereby is not 
wise.” Today, we are concentrating 
all of our reason and ammunition upon 
methods of getting or not getting 


strong drink. Yet, there is even more 
necessity today, and among young Ne. 
groes, of insisting that the intem. 
perate use. of alcohol is unhealthy and 
silly. There is no doubt but that fol. 
lowing the example of the white world 
there has been a large and dangerous 
increase in the alcohol habit among 
young folk, Whether it is caused by 
the wholesale violations of law which 
they see about them, or by the in. 
creased competition of life, or by the 
fact that we have stopped teaching 
temperance—no matter how it js 
caused—it is true. And we should be. 
gin again in school and home and 
church to spread wide warning against 
the intemperate use of alcoholic liquors, 

There is no royal road to manners 
and morals. They cannot be estab. 
lished by act of Legislature or royal 
proclamation. They can only be in. 
stilled by parental advice, the love of 
friends, and human contact. All other 
methods have failed and will fail. We 
are a drunken land today and a 
drunken race. Not because of pro 
hibition or the open saloon but because 
we have ceased to teach temperance to 
the young. 


LOS ANGELES 


N your delightful description of the 

conference at Los Angeles, | 
noticed that there was no mention of 
the work of the Los Angeles Branch. 
But on consideration I realized that 
this was the highest compliment. 
When everything goes off well, with- 
out hitch or accident, we do not see 
the machinery by which the work is 
done. But do not let anyone imagine 
that the wonderful meetings that took 
place in California just happened. They 
were the result of careful, painstak- 
ing, wearying work. For months be- 
fore the conference began outlying dis- 
tricts were visited, encouraged to hold 
meetings, to work at baby contests, in 
every way to awaken interest in the 
great event that was to come in June. 
The Los Angeles Branch raised seven 
thousand dollars for the conference at 
its baby contest alone. The music was 
arranged for, every detail was carefully 
gone over before any of the delighted 
participants arrived upon the scene. 
Not a penny was paid in salaries, but 
the work that the various committees 
accomplished I should guess would 
have taken the full time of three or 
four persons for as many months. It 
meant sacrifice, not only of time but of 
money, for professional men, like the 
Branch’s President, Dr. Claude Hud- 
son, cannot leave their offices for hours 
on a stretch without pecuniary loss. 

All this was done for the cause and 
that we might sing as you have sung, 4 
paean to the hospitality and efficiency 
of California.

for sleep, and Mrs. Fall Winds was 
very patient with them. In fact I 
sometimes think she liked to see them 
play with each other as they put on 
their brown nighties. Funny isn’t it 
that they wore brown nighties instead 
of white ones. But Mrs. Fall Winds 
seemed to like the brown ones best. 

One of their favorite games that 
they liked to play so much was to pile 
up. They would scamper along the 
ground for several yards and then all 
would pile up one upon the other. I 
even liked playing this game with 
them and often I would pile up on 
some of them while still others of 
them piled on me. 


NE LITTLE LEAF was still 

swinging on the twig of a 
great oak tree. “Come down! come 
down!” called Mrs. Fall Winds in a 
shrill voice, “I must get you in the bed 
before the blanket is spread over you”’. 
“All right”, called back One Little 
Leaf, “In a moment as soon as I get 
a few more swings”. 

By this time Mrs. Fall Winds had 
placed all of the other children in their 
places in bed and thought she was 
ready for the blanket to be spread when 
she noticed that One Little Leaf was 
still swinging away on the twig of a 
great oak tree, even though he had 
by this time put on his little brown 
nightie. ‘For shame’, she cried, 
“Are you not in bed yet?” “TI shall 
tell Mr. Fall Winds right away”. And 
she did. 

When Mr. Fall Winds looked and 
saw One Little Leaf swinging on the 
twig he gave one loud call, when down 
came One Little Leaf and fairly 
scurried into bed for he was always 
afraid of the heavy bass voice of Mr. 
Fall Winds. 

“There now, I am glad that task 
is done”, said Mrs. Fall Winds, “For 
now that all of those children are in 
bed, perhaps I may be able to get a 
little rest”. Then they were all cov- 
ered with a great white blanket and 
soon were fast asleep.

A three year lease is then given to the 
tenant for his apartment with the 
privilege of renewing the same each 
year thereafter. The tenants pay an 
average of $14.50 per room per month, 
of which approximately 54% is prin-

cost of the apartment and 47% is for

will have paid for the entire project, 
including the land, and will then have 
in their possession not a bundle of rent 
receipts of no value, but an equity in 
the apartment that will average for 
each tenant over $6,600. 


There are 511 apartments consist- 
ing of about 2400 rooms, also a doc- 
tor’s suite, a dentist’s suite and ten 
stores. The doctor’s and dentist’s 
suites and the stores are not sold on a 
cooperative basis. They are rented on 
a commercial basis and the rent re- 
ceived is credited back in order to re- 
duce the monthly payments on the 
apartments. : 


The annual budget for upkeep calls 
for an amount equivalent to approxi- 
mate 47% of the total collected from 
the tenants, and includes the care of 
the gardens, shrubs, etc., as well as the 
cost of the nursery and playground op- 
eration. 


I first, there was some hesitation 
on the part of the colored people 
on account of the small rooms and 
strict leases. Many wanted larger 
rooms and less regulation and they 
considered the rents high. Indeed, the 
carefully worked out rentals proved 
that Harlem rents in general were not 
high for the accommodations afforded, 
and in comparison with other parts 
of the city. The appeal of the Dunbar 
Apartments lay rather in the security 
of the investment and the standard of 
the tenants. 


The buildings were opened in Feb- 
ruary, 1928, and in less than six 
months, every one of the 511 apart- 
ments had been sold. Most of the 
tenants realized that while they were 
making a sort of self denying or- 
dinance ; they were setting a new stand- 
ard for Harlem living. The great 
evils of living in Harlem, and, so far 
as that is concerned, in any poor neigh- 
borhood, with people of any race, are 
noise, overcrowding, crime and delin- 
quency, dirt and ugliness. In the Dun- 
bar Apartment, noise is regulated by 
playgrounds and by time limits for 
parties, radio and music, limits which 
are sometimes irksome, but which al- 
low people to sleep. Overcrowding is 
limited by the size of the rooms them- 
selves and by rules against lodgers. 
Delinquency and crime are kept down 
by a careful sifting of applicants, by 
the uniformed watchmen day and 
night, and by peremptory dispossess for 
evil doers. Dirt and ugliness are at- 
tacked by various and sometimes mi- 
nute regulations about bottles on win- 
dow-sills, shaking mops out of win- 
dows and down the dumb waiters, dis- 
posal of garbage, hanging of clothes, 
and other rules of that sort which 
seem to many people an interference

with individual liberty, but which are 
in fact education for the necessities of 
a changed social existence. 


The experiment has had its diffi- 
culties but on the testimony of people 
who live there, it has been unusually 
successful, although it is but eight 
months old. The amount of noise has 
been astonishingly reduced, compared 
with other communities of that size, 
and the buildings are kept clean and 
beautiful. There are still numbers of 
lodgers but not nearly as many as else- 
where and, on the whole, the people 
are contented and happy and are pay- 
ing their rents. 


Already the success of the experi- 
ment is leading to other projects. Mr. 
Rockefeller himself, on a neighboring 
square, is going to erect a second set 
of buildings. Julius Rosenwald in 
Chicago, is planning a similar project 
and elsewhere there are proposals and 
plans. Thus, for the first time in 
America, organized capital faces the 
Negro problem, not in almsgiving, but 
with a definite business proposition, in- 
volving restricted profit, regulated con- 
duct on the part of the recipients and 
not simply bare utility, but beauty of 
product. It is an experiment of in- 


- terest far beyond racial lines. 


Possibility of Democracy 
(Continued from page 336) 


We can see here the enfranchise- 
ment of the Negro (1872-76). His 
disfranchisement first by intimidation 
(1880-84) and then ‘by law (1892- 
1904); then a slow increase of the 
white vote, accelerated by the 19th 
Amendment in 1920 but checked in 
1924. 


The effect of the 19th Amendment 
is interesting: not only Negroes but 
white men of these states gradually 
stopped voting after Negro disfranch- 
isement; the million voters of 1892 
falling to less than 400,000 in 1904. 
A hundred thousand were added to 
the polls, 1904-16, although a million 
and a half had been added to the popu- 
lation. A hundred and fifty thousand 
women came to the polls right after 
the adoption of the woman’s suffrage 
amendment out of a possible two mil- 
lion and 50,000 of these disappeared 
four years later in spite of a million in- 
crease in population. 


N other words, in these five states, 

out of a total of 5,145,282 persons 
21 years of age and over, there were 
635,512 votes cast in 1920. There 
were in this election, therefore, dis- 
franchised voluntarily or involuntarily, 
4,489,770 persons. Subtracting 19,000 
Negroes as actually voting from the

Three Decades of clervice

HE sovereign nations of the world 
have traditionally signalized great 
deeds of peace and of war by the 

award of a medal and a bit of ribbon, 
neither of any value in themselves but 
symbolic of all the splendor of valor, of 
wisdom, or achievement. 


The seal which appears above is our Medal 
of Honor, our Croix de Guerre, our Vic- 
toria Cross, our Order of the Golden 
Fleece. It marks our entry upon our 
thirtieth year of service to the Race. Of 
no value whatever in itself, the achieve- 
ments it symbolizes have borne fruit in the 
increased happiness, prosperity and secur- 
ity of thousands upon thousands of our 
brethren. 


Thoughtful people of our Race will unite 
with us in carrying the achievement on 
through the years to come, by putting 
their insurance dollars to work for them- 
selves and their children, and the future 
generations to be born of them, through 
insuring in Negro-owned Companies.

There is one consideration which, 
in the opinion of some, modifies these 
figures. In each one of these states 
there is practically but one party anda 
“white primary”. Ostensibly to make 
the exclusion of the Negro voter doubly 
sure a system came into vogue by which 
only white voters are admitted to the 
dominant party primary and the con- 
dition of admittance was a promise to 
abide by the decision of the primary. 
This means that in order to vote at 
all the white voter must first dis 
franchise himself so far as having any 
voice as to the major principles which 
form the chief matters of difference be 
tween parties. Practically his vote s 
confined to choosing between individ- 
uals who will carry out principles 
which he must accept before. voting 
all. If, for instance, a Southern white 
man wants to vote in the Democratic 
primary this year, he can only do

In four of the states mentioned, 
229,619 people voted in the regular 
election, while 722,271 voted in the 
primary election. If it is assumed that 
participation in the primary is some 
index of political interest, then the 
vote of the five states that we are 
studying ought to be quoted as 1% 
million rather than 600,000. But even 
this is not more than a third the num- 
ber of voters that a normal population 
of 10% millions should furnish under 
universal suffrage. It shows, not sim- 
ply the disfranchisement of practically 
all of the Negro voters, forming 40% 
of the population in these states, but 
that even if we give some weight to 
the “white primary” nearly two mil- 
lion white voters were simultaneously 
disfranchised. 

In other words, the effort to dis- 
franchise a million and a half Negro 
voters has cost the disfranchisement of 
nearly two million white voters, even 
if one assumes that the primary elec- 
tion is a fair example of the exercise 
of political power, which, of course, 
it is not.

aboos only. Now is there anyone who 
honestly contemplates this record of the 
N. A. A. C. P. who will say that it 
has not justified its existence and the 
labors of its friends and executives? 

And this record of the N. A. A. C. 
P., which includes epoch-making de- 
cisions by the United States Supreme 
Court, and a fundamental change in 
American public opinion in matters af- 
fecting the Negro race—this enormous 
work has been accomplished with a 
membership never exceeding 100,000 
and with a budget never exceeding 
$80,000 a year. Much more than this 
is often spent by other agencies on a 
single case before the United States 
Supreme Court. 

Now there are some 12,000,000 
colored people in America. Less 
than one in every hundred of these is 
amember of the N. A. A. C. P. But 
every one of them, the entire 12 mil- 
lion, is directly and indirectly bene- 
fitted by the things the N. A. A. C. P. 
has done and is doing. Not one of 
them but gains in his rights when the 
N. A. A. C. P. affirms the Negro’s 
fundamental citizenship status in court. 
Not one of them but may feel proud 
when the Spingarn Medal is awarded 
and the newsapers of the civilized 
world comment on distinguished 
achievement of a Negro American. 
But of them all, only one in a hun- 
dred is willing to pay for benefit re-

a respect for the organized might of 
the Negro race in America as well as 
for law. That is not true. What the 
N. A. A. C. P. does is to make the 
entire nation listen to the organized 
might of a very small fraction—one 
in a hundred—of the Negro race in 
America and for the handful of white 
friends of this group. If that fraction 
that one in one hundred, of Negroes 
in America who are members of the 
N. A. A. C. P. were to become two 
in one hundred, or if after a while 
one out of every ten colored Americans 
were a member of the Association 
then the Negro in American would 
have a voice which no politician, no 
office holder and no editor would dare 
to ignore. That is up to the colored 
people themselves. They can if they 
will constitute themselves emissaries of 
the Association and see to it that no 
one is left uninformed of what it js 
doing and that no one remain indif. 
ferent for lack of an invitation to join 
and make common cause with this 
engine of civil justice.

the dignified crowning of a king who 
is fortified by centuries of African tra- 
dition and culture. Only once or 
twice does Mr. Reynolds burlesque his 

story. 

Lady Kathleen Simon in McCall's 
for August describes “A Woman's 
Frontier of Freedom”. Sierra Leone, 
a land of natural beauty, with its 
frothing surf, coral reefs and deep riv- 
ers, contained within its boundaries 
215,000 black slaves, until they were 
set free on January 1, 1928. 

Juanita Ellsworth, a student in the 
School of Social Welfare of the Uni 
versity of Southern California, writes 
of “White Negroes” in Sociology for 
May-June, 1928. Miss Ellsworth 
says that in almost every case she in- 
terviewed, the person crossed the color 
line, not because of any dissatisfaction 
with the Negro group, but because o 
the larger economic opportunities a 
forded there. 

Independent for August 4 carries an 
article by Harry L. Foster who gives 
us his own idea of “That Colorful 
Black Republic”, Haiti. Mr. Foster 
feels that the Marines have instilled in 
the “trustful black natjve” a “whole 
some respect for the white man”; and 
that the only resentment displayed to 
ward Americans is found in the cities 
where the Haitian aristocrat resides 
In speaking of the educated Haitian, 
Mr. Foster says: “He rather likes t 
feel himself superior in culture to 
best of Americans. Despite an under 
lying inferiority complex—akin to thal

i ers: 
ia for August carries “Ex 
Cathedra”, a reprint of an article by 
G. D. Eaton, which appeared some 
time back in McNaught’s Magazine. 
Mr. Eaton has attempted what he be- 
lieves to be a fair exposition on the in- 
stitution of slavery and manages to ar- 
rive at some entertaining conclusions. 
Although he is not defending slavery 
and he admits it was surely a pretty 
bad system, Mr. Eaton doesn’t think 
the whipping of a slave was really a 
very terrible matter, for, he asks: 
“How do parents punish children to- 
day, and, for that matter, how do 
many school teachers punish pupils 
who are neither their property, nor 
related to them?” 

The same issue carries a colorful 
vignette, “Ten Drops of Water”, by 
Howard Snyder. Elizabeth, who liked 
to garb her strong, black body in gor- 
geous blues, greens aud reds, and who 
crooned throbbing lullabies to the 
moon, with her sweetheart, Andy, is 
the helpless victim of the share crop 
system of the South. Elizabeth’s only 
possessions are an indomitable spirit 
and five children; but ignorance and 
superstition caused her death at the 
birth of the sixth.

Bishop Delaney 
(Continued from page 341) 


In 1908 he was called to become 
Archdeacon of the Diocese of North 
Carolina. He then resigned as Vice- 
Principal of the school but was _ re- 
quested by the Bishop of the Diocese 
to retain his residence on the school 
campus, and was elected by the Board 
of Trustees as a Trustee of the School. 

In 1911 Shaw university conferred 
vpon him the degree of Doctor of Di- 
vinity. In 1918 on May 15th he was 
unanimously elected by all of the clergy 
of the Diocese as Bishop Suffragan. Be- 
fore he was consecrated, the Diocese of 
East and West Carolina and South and 
Upper South Carolina asked that his 
work include those dioceses also. He 
was consecrated Bishop in St. Augus- 
tine’s Chapel on November 19, 1918. 
_ Bishop Delaney died April 14, 1928 
in the seventieth year of his life. He 
Was not an aggressive man nor self as- 
sertive; but he was a good man, a faith- 
ful husband and the kind father of a 
arge family. Of few could it be said 
with better grace: 

_ “He hath shewed thee, O man, what 
's good; and what doth the Lord re- 
om of thee, but to do justly, and to 
ove mercy, and to walk humbly with 


thy God >”

@ A new treaty has been signed be- 
tween Italy and Abyssinia. It is said 
to provide for leasing, for twenty years, 
an area of land near the Port of Assab 
by Italy to Abyssinia. Also, a motor 
road to Addis Abeba will be built. If 
this is true, Abyssinia will thus get a 
free port at Assab and relations with 
Italy, broken off by a crushing defeat 
of the Italians at Adowa in 1896, will 
be resumed on a friendly basis. 


BELGIAN CONGO 


@ The Belgian Socialists, through the 
Socialists’ Banque du Travail, of 
Ghent, have founded cotton companies 
in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi. 
In this way the Socialists are going to 
take “active share in the development 
of the Belgian Congo”. This aston- 
ishing step should be watched with in- 
terest. 


ENGLAND 


@ Nana Sir Ofori Atta sailed from 
England for the Gold Coast, Wednes- 
day, July 18th. He visited Liverpool 
and was entertained at dinner; went 
to Manchester, and to Scotland. He 
especially was interested in various fac- 
tories and industrial works. He said 
in one of his speeches: “I think that 
the ignorance of the Englishmen of the 
value and importance of these colonies 
should not be allowed to go on.” 

@ A _ Franco-British Congress has 
been held in London under the aus- 
pices of the League of the British Em- 
pire. 

@ The International Institute of 
African Languages and Cultures is 
supported by a grant of five thousand 
dollars a year for five years by the 
Laura-Spelman Foundation; grants of 
one to two thousand dollars from vari- 
ous British colonies and Belgian and 
French colonies; subscriptions from 
missions and from various industrial 
firms, like the Niger Company, the 
Shipping Company, the Mines, etc. 
This, we fear, insures that the Insti- 
tute will attempt nothing which in- 
vested capital fears.
