ima 3-in-1 disability contracts. 


The amount of life insurance written since January |, 1930, 
under the Whole Life, Twenty Payment Life and Twenty Year 
Endowment Policies has been far in excess of the expectations of 
the officers of this company, and they likewise have been gratified 
at the persistency of the business written and the care which the 
field staff has exercised in selecting risks; that is, lapses on such 
business have been light and claims negligible. 


The company is thus rendering at this time a far larger service 
to race people over its territory than at any other period of the 
thirty-eight continuous years of its operation. Claim payments under 
its 3-in-| disability Policies have been a bulwark to tens of thou- 
sands of race people and homes during the winter period, and despite 
the general depression and lack of employment no policyholder of 


this company has had to look to or accept charity in the hour of 
Sickness, Accident or Death.

HE Naval Conference has been 

a huge and outstanding success. 
We have this on the word of Presi- 
dent Hoover, Secretary Stimson, and 
most of the stenographers.—Interna- 
tional Navies will be reduced as fol- 
lows: The United States will build 
new war ships costing 100 million 
dollars a year for the next six years; 
Italy will build twenty-nine new war 
ships costing 40 million dollars in 
1930; France can be depended upon 
to build as many as Italy; Great Brit- 
ain and Japan will “replace” some- 
thing-or-other in the line of floating 
fighters at a cost of many millions. 
Further reduction of international 
fleets will be taken up in 1935. God 
help us!—After all there is an advan- 
tage in burning up surplus convicts 
according to the Ohio plan. Over- 
crowding is relieved, board is saved, 
and the majesty of the law is upheld. 
—Why is it that May Ist is a day 
when all the world except Russia gets 
scared to death, mobilizes the police 
and keeps its soldiers ready in bar- 
racks? There must be an explana- 
tion somewhere.—Dr. Nicholas Mur- 
tay Butler has been giving Germany a

few points. He is sure that there are 
enough backward people to whom “‘a 
visionary theory of equality of men” 
does not apply, to furnish cheap labor 
and raw material not only for Great 
Britain, France and Italy, but also 
for Germany itself—And now there 
seems nothing to do but for Ramsay 
MacDonald to arrest Mahatma 
Gandhi and make English troops 
shoot down Indians and deny to India 
the very freedom which the Labor 
Party promised them. What are 
promises between Englishmen ?—When 
a Democratic Senator from New 
York discovers that the attitude of the 
white South towards Negroes is the 
same things as its attitude towards 
Labor, the millennium is in plain sight. 
Will Senator Wagner page Al Smith?

of the American Revolution, together 
with the Colonial Dames and the 
American Legion have at last been able

Langston Hughes has _ been

sends some poems to THE CRISIS,

World Peace. The items are as fol- 
lows: recognize Russia; withdraw en- 
tirely from Haiti and Nicaragua; 
scrap half the Army and Navy and 
promise to do it again if we can ob- 
tain a second; reduce the tariff 10‘: 
a year for ten years; warn Great Brit- 
ain and India in accordance with the 
Kellogg Pact; enforce the second sec- 
tion of the 14th Amendment. Of 
course we may be misinformed as to 
the above, but we’d hate to believe it. 
—The real trouble with any Anglo- 
Saxon entente is that no country in 
the world would believe Great Britain 
and America on oath. We have lied 
too often and too easily in the recent 
past.—‘‘For ’tis the sport to see the 
engineer hoist by his own petard,” 
which is another way of commiserat- 
ing with the Youngstown and Bethle- 
hem Steel Companies who are about 
to be swallowed by Wall St. in their 
efforts to escape the competition of the 
Steel Trust. Only a few more years 
and the Industrial World will be 
ruled by Wall Street and Russia.— 
The expansion of gases is the principal 
physical factor in the exploitation of 
Asia and Africa by Europe. These 
gases arise from gun powder which 
makes war, hot water which drives 
ships and machines, and carbon dioxide 
which runs autos and aeroplanes.— 
Statisticians are still trying to figure 
out a decrease in the number of unem- 
ployed. The unemployed are trying 
_to figure out enough to buy breakfast.

OST organizations of the Y. W. 

C. A., even among colored folk, 
are of a conventional type. They have 
their Girl Reserves, their mene 
classes, and instruction in health, 
gether with special work in music, na- 
ture study, and conducted play. They 
furnish dormitories and lodgings and 
secure employment. All these things 
the colored Y. W. C. A., Indianapolis, 
does. But this organization is espe- 
cially noted for its work in studying 
and opening up industrial opportunity 
for colored women. 

It is called the “Phyllis Wheatley 
Branch,” and it began in 1922 with a 
group of colored women w ho felt the 
need of some constructive work for 
colored girls in Indianapolis. They 
organized a Volunteer Workers 
Group, and after a year this became a 
branch of the Central Y. W. C. A., 
with an Executive Secretary and a 
Committee of Management. 

Their real work began with an ef- 
fort to improve conditions in a local 
glove factory where colored women 
were employed. In the course of time 
twelve different industrial establish- 
ments were surveyed and advised. In 
1923 and in 1929, they made surveys 
and reports. The State of Indiana has 
practically no labor legislation for wo- 
men and publishes few statistics. Their 
study included all women in industry 
but did not touch household employees 
and women in business. In 1929, the 
reached 142 establishments,

Women Workers in Indianapolis 





This is the story of a Y. W.C. 
A. that is different and is making 
at least an initial step in the eco- 
nomic re-building of black America 
by carefully ascertaining the pres- 
ent facts. 





where 1,493 Negro women were em- 
ployed. Fifty-four personal visits were 
made and other information gathered 
by reports and by telephone. 

Many employers willingly gave in- 
formation while others gave it grudg- 


ingly. In one place the visitor was 
refused admittance while in a large 


hotel the visitor was not allowed to 
enter the front door and had difficul- 
ties with the back door man who was 
not at all courteous. Owing to the 
fact that he was not told in detail the 
mission of the visitor, he refused to 
let her see the housekeeper with whom 
she had made an appointment. In 
another hotel the visitor entered the 
front door but was not allowed to ride 
on the elevator. One employer gave 
the investigator just five minutes for 
an interview, while he held his watch 
in his hand. Many such regulations 
had to be conformed with before the 
employment manager could be seen. 

The summary says: 

“Negro women workers in the city 


A Glove Factory in Indianapolis 






of Indianapolis are engaged primarily 
in the type of work classified as ‘un- 
skilled labor’. This includes jobs such 
as maids, waitresses, laundry work, 
elevator jobs which require short or 
no apprenticeships. 

“The clothing industry was the only 
one requiring skill and a long appren- 
ticeship. This industry includes the 
making of gloves, white duck coats and 
jackets and uniforms of various kinds. 
To be thoroughly efficient in this work 
one must be an apprentice for at least 
six months. It is in this trade that she 
receives her greatest opportunity for 
advancement and a higher salary. In 
other industries of the city Negro wo- 
men are on the ‘bottom round’. In 
many places where other women are 
doing machine processes, she does only 
the porter work or may help in the 
cafeteria.” 

Negro women also work in small 
numbers. There were 54 places hir- 
ing more than 5 girls and 88 hiring 
less than five. 

“The abundant labor supply is not 
only a problem within itself as to how 
it can be absorbed into the economic 
system of the city, but it also helps 
keep wages low and working condi- 
tions poor. In all except three places 
the employers had lists of girls who 
wanted work, and it was therefore no 
trouble to replace those who quit.” 

In the case of 54% of the unskilled 
workers, data concerning wages were 
received : 








“Half of the women receive $10.00 
or more, while the other half receive 
less than $10.00. Most of the women 
in the classification $10.00-$10.99 were 
getting $10.00 per week. Those who 
received $16.00 to $19.00 per week 
were cooks in large restaurants, and 
might be classed as skilled workers. 
Some of those receiving $13.50 per 
week were elevator girls. 

“The majority of women, 467 in 
number, were getting $9.00 and $10.00 
a week, and when room, board, cloth- 
ing, education, and recreation have to 
be taken out of this sum it means that 
some of the very necessities of life must 
be done without. 

“The skilled workers, 338 in num- 
ber, received from $10.00 to $20.00 
per week, with the majority of girls re- 
ceiving between $12.00 and $15.00. 

“The conditions under which the 
largest number of women work are 
certainly not pleasant. One of the 
rest rooms for colored girls was in the 
sub-basement, while the one for the 
white girls was on the seventh floor. 
In most of the department stores there 
was much congestion so that both 
white and colored women were poorly 
placed. However, with this conges- 
tion the policy of segregation was car- 
ried out thus making the place for the

minority group small and uncomfort- 
able. In some places there was only 
a partial partition between the rest 
room and toilet room. 

“In the largest factory in the city 
for our girls where 300 are employed, 
the toilet rooms and rest rooms are 
well kept and working conditions are 
very good. Lighting, ventilation, and 
other necessary elements are also of 
the best. 


“Many of the jobs had a disagree. 
able element in them; for example, ey. 
treme heat, odors, and eye strain, 
Vhese were not offset by attractive or 
adequate rest rooms. Conditions vary 
vreatly. 

‘Seasonal industries often hire Ne. 
gro women to work during the rush 
season, keeping only a few during the 
slack period. In one place the man. 
ager hired about 100 girls in summer 
and only 40 in winter. In another 
place the girls were called when 
needed. If there was lots of work she 
worked long hours each day and then 
maybe she had no work at all for the 
next week, 

“Not one found 
among Negro women employees for 
the betterment of industrial conditions 
in their plant, even where large num- 
bers of them are employed. There 
were no shop committees, unions, or 


organization was 


similar organizations. 

“The places for training were al- 
most as few as the organizations. The 
sewing industry trains its workers, and 
one department store has a training 
school in which a girl works a week 
before she is permanently hired.” 

It seems that the following facts 
would summarize the Negro woman 
and her industrial life in Indianapolis:

many Negro women earn a livelihood. 
The experienced woman day laborer 
of Indianapolis receives $2.60 per day, 
while those working for a weekly wage 
receive $9.00 and $10.00. Inexperi- 
enced persons get less than this. 

“The Branch Employment Bureau 
does not send out full-time workers for 
less than $10.00 a week, but many calls 
desiring girls for less come to the 
building. 






“One lady called wanting a trust- 
worthy, reliable, morally clean girl 
who was efficient, to do general house- 
work and cooking for $6.00 a week. 
Another called for a part-time worker 
whose hours were to be from 7 to 2 
and 6 to 8. The wage offered was 
$5.00 per week. This in reality meant 
that she wanted a girl to work seven 
hours a day, six days per week for 
$5.00. 

“Most of those doing general house- 
work have no place to house their help. 
‘They must stay at their own homes.” 

All this work of industrial investi- 
gation, together with the other activi- 
ties of the Y. W. C. A., were for a 
long time housed in an old and inade- 
quate building, and it seemed very 
hard to get anything better. In 1926, 
however, under the present Executive 
Secretary, Miss May B. Belcher, a 
site was selected, and then in Decem- 
ber a white citizen of Indianapolis 
gave $10,000 for a building fund. The 
building program was put through in 
1927. A total of $218,000 was raised, 
out of which $199,339 was paid for 
the lot, building and equipment. The 
new building was started in August, 
1928, and formally dedicated in Oc- 
tober, 1929. Its present membership 
is 1,700 women and girls. The build- 
ing is beautiful and commodious with 
parlors, dormitories, a swimming pool, 
a cafeteria and other conveniences. 


The Gilpin Players of Cleveland 


HE most successful Negro Little 

Theater movement in the United 
States is that of the Gilpin Players in 
Cleveland, Ohio. This year, they 
have won unusual distinction. The 
Cleveland Plain Dealer, a leading daily 
of the Middle West, established a 
Theatre of the Nations. Thirty-six 
national groups were represented on 
the Advisory Committee and twenty- 
nine of these have given plays. 

Among the nationalities represented 
were: Greek, Syrian, Negro, Hindu, 
Russian, Dutch, English, Bulgarian, 
Welsh, Armenian, Chinese, Hungar- 
ian, Slovak, Czech, Slovenian, Croa- 
tian, Swedish and German. During 
the remainder of the season plays will 
be presented under the auspices of the 
German, French, Spanish, Hebrew, 
Polish, Lithuanian, Danish, Yiddish, 
Ukrainian, Irish and Italian. 

The Little Theater of Public Hall, 
designed and built for such a move- 
ment, is being used principally in the 
staging of these productions. 

The project met with immediate suc- 
cess, each group presenting worthy pro- 
ductions and playing to packed houses,

often turning hundreds away. 
In this series the Gilpin Players 


presented. “Roseanne” by Nan B. 
Stephens. “Roseanne” was produced 


in New York with Charles Gilpin as 
preacher in 1923 and a second time 
with Chrystal Herne in the title role. 
This year, the Gilpin Players produced 
it so successfully that the Ohio 
Theatre, one of the/leading commercial 
theatres of the city, put the play on 
for a week’s run, March 17. 

This is the most successful accom- 
plishment of any amateur group in the 
city. Who are the Gilpin Players? 
We can perhaps best learn of them 
from the mouth of Rowena Woodham 
Jelliffe, the young white woman who 
leads them. She writes: 

“Back in the fall of 1920, four or 
five young men and women with a bit 
of blind groping in their natures for 
something creative and _ interesting, 
talked of the formation of a social- 
dramatic club which should be neither 
laboriously dramatic nor flippantly so- 
cial. Their efforts in neither direc- 
tion were strikingly successful but in 
spite of many trials, they didn’t dis- 


band. In March of 1921, they came 
to me, told me of their interest and 
asked if I thought they ought to give 
it up or go on. I replied that I thought 
they ought to go on, not as a social- 
dramatic club but as a drama study 
group. Whereupon they asked for my 
leadership which I promised. For the 
balance of the winter, we read plays 
and talked of the function of drama 
and of the opportunity of the Negro 
in that field. 

“IT had come to my own opinions 
about the potential offerings of the 
Negro to drama back in 1916 and 
1917 from playing with and watching 
Negro children playing with white 
children. I saw a definite difference 
in the play ways of the two races. It 
is hard now to say just what it was I 
saw, but it was something in the way 
in which they gave themselves to a 
situation—a surrender to the mood the 
game called for. And I came slowly 
to realize that this was the essence 
of drama, and that the Negro had 
racially the wherewithal from which to 
give abundantly to the art. 

“Finally, we selected three one-act 


191 
































plays for performance. Our work 
was begun. And from that time to 
this, the group has had continuous 
existence and regular performances. 
They have played to date sixty-four 
plays, are an incorporated group and 
still have active in the group all the 
charter members. 


“Originally the group was called the 
Dumas Dramatic Club, but was re- 
named and incorporated as The Gilpin 
Players in 1923 out of appreciation 
of and gratitude to Charles Gilpin 
who, when playing in Cleveland in 
“The Emperor Jones’, came to see 
them, gave them good advice and 
much encouragement. 


“At two periods during the last nine 
years, when I have been pressed by 
other duties in connection with the 
Playhouse work, have I stepped to the 
background in active direction of the 
group and employed for them trained 
dramatic coaches. From both of these 
people who were devoted to them and 
genuinely interested in them, they 
gained a deal of valuable experience 
and technique. But from my position 
in the background, I saw on both occa- 
sions that what these- coaches were 
actirally doing was to toss them trick 
after trick from the well-worn white 
actors’ trick bag. Believing as I did, 
that the Negro had his own contribu- 
tion to make to drama, I felt that we 
had better disband altogether than to 
deteriorate into a group of mere pos- 
turing performers. The result was 
that I took the group under my own 
direction, where they have been for the 
past three years. 

“It is our purpose to develop the 
Negro’s particular dramatic quality, to 
keep our group from being too con- 
taminated by the western theatrical 
manner; to develop and use dramatic 
technique but never to be submerged 
by it. Whatever success we have had 
has been due to this and to the fine 
sincerity and earnest devotion of the 
group. 

“In the early days, they were in- 
dignant at the very suggestion of doing 
a Negro play. So, although I have 
always wanted to do such plays, I 
never pressed the matter, preferring to 
wait with a good deal of impatience 
until they of their own accord should 
choose to do them. Our first Negro 
play was ‘Granny Maumee,’ Opinion 
about it was divided in the group and 
our audience both praised and damned 
us for doing it. The next year, we 
did “Compromise” by Willis Richard- 
son which was slightly better received. 
And so, gradually we came to our 
present position, where we are proud- 
est and happiest to do Negro plays. 
Since there are so few to do, the bulk 
of our playing is necessarily through 


192

the medium of so-called white plays. 
But when we do ‘white’ plays, we 
don’t chalk our faces and ‘prance 
white.” We simply and blandly dis- 
regard such a thing as race—and we 
somehow get by. Several critics have 
remarked that certain plays such as 
‘Sun-Up’, ‘Ice-bound’ and ‘Wappin’ 
Wharf’ take on a new and vital qual- 
ity when performed by our group. 
“For years we played in school 
buildings, or rented old beer halls— 
and came more and more to long for 
our own theatre. And the longing be- 
came so intense that finally, without 
any money back of us, we took over a 
terrible old pool room, rat-ridden, and 
demolished and made our own theatre. 
Those are heavenly days and nights 
to remember. We did all our own 
work. We plastered it, papered it, 
wired it, installed new plumbing, put 
a furnace in it ourselves. Far into the 
night we worked, doing bits of re- 
hearsing while we worked, singing, for- 
getting that we were tired, growing 
te love our little theatre in a way that 
one loves only those things which they 
have created. Then we came to the 
decoration of it—and decided to make 
it African. Then there began the dig- 
ging into musty, dusty old books and 
manuscripts to find—what is African. 


We copied beautiful wood carved 
bowls and made inverted light fixtures 
of them. Bits of picture writing we 
carved here and there, copied from 
cave walls. And over all, on the ceil- 
ing, we painted the great African sun. 
It is beautiful. We love it. It is 
ours.” 

Mrs. Jelliffe came to New York and 
did specialized work in the drama that 
she might have more of value to give 
to this group. She studied dramatic 
production under Robert Milton and 
David Burton, pantomime under Mar- 
tha Graham and dancing under 
Michie Ito. 

The Gilpin Players are the only Ne- 
gro repertory group in the country that 
have a theatre of their own. Each 
year, they present six productions for 
their season’s subscribers, giving five 
performances of each. Other plays 
are presented for special occasions. 

The officers of the Gilpin Players 
are Hazel Mountain Walker, presi- 
dent; Pearl Mitchell, vice-president; 
Vivian Howard, secretary; Albert 
Haywood, treasurer; and Elmer Jay 
Cheeks, business manager 

Through their study of African art,

FRICA which centuries ago lost 

step in the march of civilization 
is now forced once again into the line 
of procession. Whether she desires it 
or not, the impact of Western Civili- 
zation is upon her, compelling her to 
proceed in its direction or be trampled 
under foot. Although she can not yet 
advance with the same strides as the 
West, yet it cannot be denied that she 
is progressing. Her pace is necessarily 
tedious and irksome because the road 
over which she must travel is perhaps 
the stoniest in the world today, and 
the obstructions she must overcome are 
some of the greatest man has to en- 
counter. 

She moves forward so slowly that 
she appears to be merely marking time. 
Therefore it seems that those of us 
whose steps are a little quicker and 
firmer should reach out a hand to help 
her on this arduous march. This is a 
real challenge which we as American 
Negroes cannot well afford to ignore. 
It is true that as yet, we are just find- 
ing our own stride, for we face many 
of the same difficulties, but because of 
our long contact with Western civili- 
zation and the bitter experience 
through which we passed, we are bet-

Africa—Our Challenge 


By MRS. SUSIE WISEMAN YERGAN 


Max Yergan is the only Ameri- 
can Negro Y. M. C. A. worker in 
South Africa. His admission and 
right to work was secured only 
after extraordinary effort and in- 
fluence brought to bear on the of- 
ficials of South Africa and in spite 
of efforts of certain American 
whites to block the project. 

Mrs. Susie Wiseman Yergan is 
associated with her husband. She 
is a native of Salisbury, N. C., and 
an honor graduate of Shaw Uni- 
versity. In addition to her duties 
as mother and teacher of her three 
children, she organizes and directs 
clubs for Native women and se- 
cures scholarships for Native girls 
to attend Lovedale Institute and 
the Fort Hare Native College. 
She returned to America last Au- 
gust on account of the illness of 
her mother. After a month her 
mother showed such marked im- 
provement that it was possible for 
Mrs. Yergan to make several visits 
in the South, East and West in the 
interest of the African work, and 
to be present at the National Con- 
ference on Colored Work of the 
Y. M. C. A., at which she made 
this remarkably clear and challeng- 
ing presentation of the claims of

The Gilpin Players of Cleveland in “Rosanne.” 


Europe and America are just within 
recent years realizing the magnitude 
of Africa and the vastness of her po- 
tential wealth. This continent is said 
to be no less than one fifth of the land 
area of the world. It is three times 
as large as Europe and half again as 
large as the continent of North Amer- 
ica. This huge continent which is the 
home of the black races is so chopped 
up and divided among the European 
powers that the native races, with the 
possible exception of those within the 
few Mandates, are foreigners in their 
own country. The country is in real- 
ity an immense extension of the con- 
tinent of Europe. It is said that in 
the nineteenth century the population 
of Europe increased three-fold. This 
meant an enlarged demand for food, 
for more abundant supplies of raw 
material, and for new markets for the 
products of the factories. Then there 
was a great scramble by the powers of 
Europe for the possession of Africa 
whose mineral, agricultural, as well as 
animal wealth make it one of the most 
valuable quarters of the globe. 

South Africa, where the climate is 
delightful for the greater part of the 
year and where the scenery is beauti- 
ful and inspiring, is a lovely garden 
spot for the Europeans who come to 
settle permanently in the country. 
After the over crowded conditions in 
Europe where the struggle for exist- 
ence is keen, it is a paradise. This is 
true of the poorer classes who go out 











there to better their conditions. Al- 
though certain parts of Africa are un- 
healthy to the white man, South Af- 
rica is a resort for some of the health 
seekers of Europe. For various rea- 
sons Europeans have gone to South 
Africa to the extent of a million and 
a half. 

The problems of South Africa are 
some of the most perplexing in the 
world today. These problems are 
created by this sudden impact of what 
is considered a highly developed civili- 
zation upon the lives of peoples for 
the most part in the primitive stages 
of human development. The West- 
ern capital which is being poured into 
the country to develop her rich re- 
sources creates a perplexing economic 
problem. The government of one 
people by another presents a compli- 
cated political problem. The presence 
of European population attempting to 
make a permanent settlement in the 
country alongside of a race whose 
background is essentially different de- 
velops an acute racial problem. 


Lord Balfour once said that the eco- 
nomic, political and racial problems 
are, all inter-connected so that they 
constitute a problem novel in history 
to which there is no precedent or par- 
allel in the memory or experience of 
man. The difficulties of the African 
brought about by the European in 
South Africa are very real indeed. The 
Negro appreciates the benefits arising 
from occupation such as the suppres- 
sion of human sacrifice, or incessant 
warfare and of slavery. The intro- 
duction of roads and railways have 
been a boon to the progress of the peo- 
ple. Trade, Education and Medical 
service have all contributed to the 
prosperity of the country. It is also 
true that Mission work can be carried 
on more effectively than before. The 
African realizes these benefits from 
the European; but at the same time 
he knows that he has lost so much that 
he will have to change his whole out- 
look on life in order to fit into the 
new state of things. He finds that his 
ancient customs, beliefs and social or- 
ganizations have all been destroyed. 
He is left bewildered and devoid of 
anything to guide him over the con- 
fusing road Europe has mapped out 
for him. 

The West which has such a superi- 
ority complex ‘that it is difficult for 
her to understand the value of that 
which is unlike her own, does not real- 
ize the value of Africa’s past heritage. 
Africa had a culture all her own. It 
was not necessarily inferior to West- 
ern culture but rather it was different. 
Since culture is said to be adapted to 
its environment and is in a certain 
degree created by it, the African had 
real culture—the full expression of 


194 


racial life. His social organization 
was simple but adjusted to the needs 
of his simple life. His code of ethics 
embodied some of the highest ideals. 
For instance, the “Lobola Custom”, 
which means the exchange of cattle 
for the bride, viewed superficially, is 
considered a mercenary act, yet it has 
a deeper ethical significance in that it 
insures protection to the bride. I 
know certain well educated girls who 
still hold that they want to be Lobo- 
laed. 

The African had his art. His 
sculpture is now attracting the interest 
of the West. His music, though not 
well known, deserves high apprecia- 
tion. His imagination had found ade- 
quate expression, in an almost inex- 
haustible store of folk-lore which is 
often real poetry. In the caves of the 
Zimbabwe ruins I found not only 
paintings on the walls but also gold 
ornaments which showed that Africa 
had its culture. 


Now in South Africa this heritage 
has been lost and the very foundation 
of the African’s life has been swept 
from under him. He is left impover- 
ished, bewildered and confused. He 
cannot follow the old lines which are 
broken, but he must follow new lines 
of Western civilization. 

It is true that there are great re- 
gions in South Africa where primitive 
conditions still prevail; where the Af- 
rican still lives and works much as 
his forefathers did under a modified 
tribal rule. There are also large agri- 
cultural regions which are the natural 
home of conservative traditions, but 
the general system of government 
forced upon him is that of a highly 
civilized country. 


The old system of tribal rule, with 
all of its defects, was suited to the 
needs of a primitive people. The pres- 
ence of the European in the country 
has caused a gradual decay of this sys- 
tem. This tribal disintegration has 
brought about dangers and difficulties 
with which the Africans have been un- 
able to cope. Numbers of them who 
have broken away from tribal life have 
sunk into a condition of misery and 
social degradation. 


Under the ancient tribal system, the 
African had enough land for his needs 
because the struggle for existence was 
not keen. When that land proved 
worthless he moved on to another place 
and built his hut; but now the reserves 
where he can live are over crowded 
and the land often inferior. Very lit- 
tle is done to train him as an agricul- 
turist. Therefore he can scarcely 
make a livelihood for his family from 
the soil. 


When droughts, which prevail in 
many parts of South Africa, come as 





they have done in the last four years, he 
almost starves. When I and my hys. 
band returned to South Africa 
the country had _ passed through : 
serious drought. As we rode along on 
the trains it was a sad sight to see the 
little nude children whose protruding 
ribs and thin legs showed signs of ex. 
treme hunger. Every time the train 
stopped, they ran along its side beg- 
ging us to throw out the remnants of 
our lunch to them. When we did s 
they scrambled in the dust hungrily 
searching for the least morsel. At 
such times as this, the hospitals are 
filled to overflowing. 

The result of this land system js 
that men must go away for periods of 
several months at a time while the 
women struggle on with the family at 
home. The young men who go to the 
mines form the largest single groups. 
It is said that annually they average 
180,000 of the best specimens of man- 
hood between the ages of 18 and 30, 
south of the Zambesi. In these great 
mining centers we find them herded 
together in the close, unsanitary quar- 
ters, imbibing the immoralities of the 
lowest classes of Europeans and catch- 
ing their diseases. Very often they 
return broken in health or perhaps in- 
jured by some accident. One of our 
most frequent visitors was a blind 
man, 40 years old, who lost his sight 
by an explosion in the mines and was 
paid $100 for the injury. These fig- 
ures indicate the dangerous character 
of the mine: during the years 1916- 
21 dnclusive 15,954 casualties oc- 
curred, the deaths being 2,936. The 
commonest source of accident is over- 
hanging rock. During the same period 
18,331 died of disease. This is a 
great sacrifice to the race when one 
considers that the workers are chosen 
from the best physical types of man- 
hood. There is some improvement in 
conditions since that time but still the 
death total is heavy. 

The females also flock to these 
areas by the thousands and sink along 
with the males into the lowest depths 
of shame and degradation. Drink and 
illicit liquor traffic are some of the 
overwhelming evils. Not only the 
men and women drink, but young 
children. Women because of the cut 
of their garments conduct illicit liquor 
traffic more successfully than men and 
more are engaged in it. Fatal brawls 
are frequent. It is said that in one 
school of a hundred children, only fit 
teen or twenty pupils came from homes 
having paternal protection. 

Besides finding employment in the 
mines, big strapping men accept em 
ployment as household servants in cer- 
tain parts of South Africa. Although 
they may be bearded men, these “boys | 
as they are called, perform the tasks of

cook, housemaid, and even nurse maid. 
It is estimated that about 50,000 of 
them are admitted to European homes 
during the course of eighteen months. 
Since sweeping, dusting, making beds 
and the like, are duties which take 
them through all parts of the house 
during any part of the day, they are 
often exposed to immodesty and in- 
discretion on the part of the women 
of these homes. This tends to lower 
their respect not only for these women 
but for all womanhood. These male 
household servants morally and spir- 
itually are a neglected group. 


The change from a primtive, pas- 
toral life in the free open country 
where there is plenty of sunshine and 
fresh air to the squalid crowded slums 
in the cities creates a situation calami- 
tous to the race, for these people are 
in every way unprepared for the sud- 
den transition. Contrasted with the 
simple life in the kraal huts, we find 
them huddled together in iren shan- 
ties, sometimes eight or ten living in 
one room. One writer has said that 
in Johannesburg the slums are so dis- 
graceful and immoral that the thought 
of them murders sleep. The condi- 
tions under which people live in loca- 
tions outside of South African towns 
are awful beyond description. We do 
not say that the old life is always pure 
and clean but it was wholesome com- 
pared with this slum life. 


Before the advent of the European 
into the country, the amount of work 
that the African did was regulated by 
his immediate needs which were not 
great. In South Africa cattle breeding 
was his chief occupation. This easy 
pastoral life together with the climate 
had such an effect upon his character 
that it is exceedingly difficult for him 
to make adaptation to regular work 
under modern conditions. | Accus- 
tomed to a world without clocks, 
where time is of little consequence, 
and where they can do what they like 
and when they like, the regular and 
persistent methods of European indus- 
try soon become irksome to them, so 
that they must go home and rest a 
while. They are therefore accused of 


indolence and are paid a very low wage 
for their work. 


Under changed conditions when the 
African’s life is no longer simple and 
primitive, he finds it very difficult to 
make a livelihood for his family on the 
low wage he receives. When his max- 
imum wage may be $15 per month it 
is very hard for him to feed a family 
which may consist of a wife and from 
5 to / children especially when civili- 
zation demands that he adopt Euro- 
pean dress, etc. When he has to pay 
from four to five dollars for a bag 
of corn, which is his staple diet, it is 


June, 1930 


barely possible for the family to exist. 

Again the Color Bar Bill, which was 
passed in 1926, discourages his efforts 
to become a skilled laborer, for the 
would hardly be given a certificate by 
the government which would entitle 
him to seek employment. This Color 
Bar Bill was introduced as a measure 
of protection to the 130,000 “poor 
whites” whose degeneracy is assumed 
tc be due to the black man’s compe- 
tition and upward rise. It is a cruel 
blow to the African for it condemns 
him always to bottom unskilled work 
while the skilled work to which he 
naturally aspires is reserved for the 
white man. 


The health of the people is greatly 
affected by this new life for they not 
only suffer from their own diseases, 
with which many of the witch doctors 
could very well cope, but they suffer 
from the diseases of the white man; 
these the African does not understand. 
Therefore tuberculosis, sleeping sick- 
ness and the like play havoc with the 
people, whose poverty and ignorance do 
not allow them proper medical atten- 
tion. The death rate is high especially 
among children. 


Under the changed conditions the 
people do not know how to care for 
children properly for they know noth- 
ing of disease, germs, flies, mosquitoes, 
etc. One day I read these startling fig- 
ures: In one year of the 575 born at 
Port Elizabeth 154 died; at East Lon- 
don, of 597 born, 131 died; at Johan- 
nesburg, of 470 born, 173 died. All 
these deaths occurred before the age 
of twelve months. One report I read 
showed an infant death-rate at Johan- 
nesburg of 455 deaths per thousand 
against 60 per thousand in a Euro- 
pean town a mile away. In the same 
year in an enlightened country like 
England only 12 out of a thousand 
died. These are some of the appalling 
situations in South Africa. 


Although I said South Africa has 
lost heavily, and because of her im- 
poverished condition there is moral and 
physical degeneracy, yet we believe the 
trend is upward. The missionaries 
who have borne the burden these long 
years are seeing results. Out of the 
scanty funds which are provided large- 
ly by the poor in their homelands, they 
have carried on the work in spite of 
indifference, oft times opposition. They 
even persevered when the African him- 
self saw no need of mission work. As 
a result the young Africans are clamor- 
ing for education. It is through this 
group of students that we hope to help 
Africa find her way over her precipi- 
teus roads. 

Another important aspect of our 
work has been along interracial lines, 
for the hope of Africa rests not only 








with the African students but with the 
European students who will perhaps 
have the largest responsibility in shap- 


ing her destiny. At first it was barely 
possible to get a hearing but now Mr. 


Yergan has responded to pressing invi- 


tations to address large European gath- 
erings in the colleges of South Africa. 
It is encouraging to find numbers of 
these Christian students not only will- 
ing to study these situations concerning 
the welfare of the Africans, but actual- 
ly ready to pay the price. 


In a small conference at Lovedale 
both European and African students 
met and it was a joy to see how frank- 
ly and fearlessly both groups discussed 
the most delicate interracial questions. 
At a European student conference in a 
small Dutch village, Mr. Yergan 
spoke in a public meeting at the city 
hall. When he had finished some of 
the most conservative of the older 
Dutchmen mounted the rostrum and 
shook his hand, tears almost streaming 
down their cheeks, and exclaimed that 
they now saw this whole racial prob- 
lem in a new light and intended to 
live their last years according to that 
light. Truly great spiritual forces 
are at work in Africa even as they are 
in other parts of the world todav. It 
is the dawn of a new day for Africa. 


Our task now is to try to raise up 
among the students we reach through 
our associations a number of strong 
leaders who will give their lives un- 
reservedly to the people in the years 
to come. This we believe to be a new 
era upon which we are now entering 
and this era will demand well educat- 
ed, deeply consecrated, inspired men 
and women who will lead the people. 
We hope our movement will soon be 
in position to provide this leadership. 


The building which we hope to erect 
at Fort Hare will serve not only as 
headquarters for the work (I might 
say just here that our headquarters are 
now on our back veranda), but also 
a training center for this new leader- 
ship. We hope that this building will 
serve as a kind of an experimental 
laboratory for trying out different 
types of social work. 


In the second place it is now time 
to begin a type of work for the non- 
student groups who live in the town. 
If we do not then the purpose of this 
leadership will be lost. The Associa- 
tions will be the channels through 
which inspired, trained men may guide 
the lives of other young Africans. 
Something of this kind is so much 
needed for this non-student class of 
young people. It is a deplorable sight 
to see them gathered on the street 
corners at night and on Sunday after- 
noons with nothing to do, for life for

THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 





a 


21ST ANNUAL CONFERENCE, 
SPRINGFIELD, MASS. 


T was generally known and felt that 

the twenty-first Annual Conference 
of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People in 
Springfield, Massachusetts, would be 
an event important not only in the 
history of the Association but in the 
history of the Negro in America. It 
was felt to be appropriate that the 
Association, which has carried on the 
long struggle for complete emacipation 
and full opportunity for the Ameri- 
can Negro should hold the gathering 
that marked its majority, the entrance 
upon its twenty-first year, upon old 
abolition ground, in Massachusetts. 

More than this, the record of 
achievement by the Association, em- 
bodied in the victories it has won in 
the highest courts of the land, and its 
victorious marshalling of public opin- 
ion, have made this year’s meeting of 
unusual significance. For one thing, 
the results are to be announced in 
Springfield of that nation-wide move- 
ment among colored Americans, 
through the Moorfield Storey-Louis 
Marshall Memorial Campaign, to tes- 
tify to their gratitude to the two great 
champions of the Negro’s basic rights 
and to the living faith that the work 
of defense, of emancipation and of 
affirmation must and shall go on. 

But something has happened of 
which the entire country is deeply 
conscious, that adds immensely to the 
importance of this year’s gathering. 
The National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People comes 
to Springfield not merely as a legal aid 
body, not merely as the champion of 
the weak and defenceless against prej- 
udice and rapacity, not merely as a 
voice crying in what often has seemed 
to be the veriest wilderness. It comes 
to Springfield this year as the leader 
in one of the major political battles 
to have been fought by any minority 
group in this time, having for its ob- 
ject to defend the highest court in the 
land against the imputation of domi- 
nation by political forces for crass poli- 
tical advantage. 

No reader of THe Crisis, prob- 
ably, will remain ignorant of the strug- 
sule the N. A. A. C. P. made against 
the confirmation of President Hoov- 
er’s nomination to the U. U. Supreme 
Court of Judge Jolin J. Parker of 
North Carolina. That struggle 


196 





echoed throughout the civilized world. 
It has formed the subject of leading 
editorials in so many newspapers that 
merely to cite their names would take 
up a good part of an entire page in THE 
Crisis. Thousands and thousands of 
feet of news space were given to this 
struggle which convulsed the ranks of 
the dominant political party in the 
country, the Republican party, and 
which brought clearly into the open 
one of the major questions confront- 
ing the American Negro today; 
namely, the right to vote, as a full- 
fledged citizen of the United States of 
America. 


As we go to press the news 
comes that the victory is won by 
a vote of 41 to 39. John Johnston 
Parker has been refused confirma- 
tion by the Senate as Associate 
Justice of the Supreme Court of 
the United States. Thirty-four Re- 


publicans and 13 Democrats fa- 
vored Parker, while 22 Republi- 
cans, 26 Democrats and 1 Farmer 


Laborite opposed him. This is the 


greatest political victory which 
united Negro America has won 
since the Civil War. 





Other groups beside the National As- 
sociation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People helped. The Ameri- 
can Federation of Labor repeatedly 
voiced its opposition. Liberals, who 
have been apprehensive of the conserva- 
tive and even reactionary tendency of 
the U. S. Supreme Court, have also 
been opposing Parker. 

But, it has generally been conceded, 
the outstanding blows against the 
Parker nomination were struck by the 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People, functioning 
through its National Office, through 
its branches in the various states and 
cities of the country, and backed up 
staunchly by the colored editors of the 
nation, who have made themselves felt 
as the unified voice of a strong group 
in America. That fight was recog- 
nized by the nation at large and by 
the colored people themselves to mark 
a new epoch in the civil and political 
status of the American Negro. Now 
for the first time, Ne&roes were vocal 
and were making themselves felt as an 
organized political unit, with votes in 
many states carrying with them the 
balance of power in the coming sena- 
torial elections. No longer as a sup- 





& 


pliant who might be disregarded 
will or convenience, but as a legal 
voter, a full-fledged citizen and , 
bearer of political responsibility anq 
power, the Negro’s voice was heard, 

That voice of the aroused Negro 
not only brought about a formidable 
revolt among Republican Senators 
against the policy of President Hoover 
in seeking to conciliate the “Lily 
White” Southerners; but it threw cop- 
sternation into the ranks of the Demo- 
crats as well. The Democratic sena- 
tors were placed between the devil and 
the deep sea. On the one hand, if 
they supported Judge Parker’s candi- 
dacy, they were helping to reward the 
solid South for going Republican. On 
the other hand, if they opposed Judge 
Parker, they were joining with the 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People in opposing 
the Supreme Court nominee whom 
Senator Cole Blease of South Caro- 
lina referred to as “the South’s only 
hope”. It was a pretty political pic- 
ture, which the Negroes and their 
friends could look on with consider- 
able amusement, of a _ Republican 
President, attempting to rely upon 
Southern senators in order to place 
upon the bench of the United States 
Supreme Court a Southern judge who 
had displayed his contempt for the 14th 
and 15th Amendments to the U. S. 
Constitution, in a political speech made 
ten years earlier. 

What Judge Parker said, in April, 
of 1920, when he was a candidate for 
Governor of North Carolina, was 
quoted from in the Greensboro Daily 
News of April 19, 1920. Clipping 
of that news article is in possession of 
the N. A. A. C. P. Photostat copies 
were made and widely distributed. 
Since the exact quotation is of con- 
siderable importance, forming the basis 
of the N. A. A. C. P. opposition to 
Judge Parker, I reproduce it here in 
full. Judge Parker’s undenied and 
unrepudiated remarks in 1920 as pub- 
lished in the Greensboro Daily News 
were as follows: 

“The Republican party in North 
Carolina has accepted the amendment* 
in the spirit in which it was passed and 
the Negro has so accepted it. I have 
attended every State Convention since 
1908 and I have never seen a Negro 
delegate in any Convention that I at 


* That is the state constitutional amendment 0 
1900 which disfranchised Negroes and contained 
a “Grandfather clause” which the U. S. Supreme 
Court in 1915 declared unconstitutional.

tended. The Negro as a class does not 
desire to enter politics. The Republi- 
can Party of North Carolina does not 
desire him to do so. We recognize the 
fact that he has not yet reached that 
stage in his development when he can 
share the burdens and responsibilities of 
Government. ‘This being true, and every 
intelligent man in North Carolina knows 
that it is true, the attempt of certain 
petty Democratic politicians to inject the 
race issue into every campaign is most 
reprehensible. I say it deliberately, 
there is no more dangerous or con- 
temptible enemy of the State than men 
who for personal or political advantage 
will attempt to kindle the flame of racial 
prejudice or hatred. . . the participa- 
tion of the Negro in politics is a source 
of evil and danger to both races and is 
not desired by the wise men in either 
race or by the Republican party of North 
Carolina.” 

Judge Parker’s own statements con- 
demn him as unfit to sit on the U. S. 
Supreme Court. It remains to say a 
few words of what the struggle against 
him by the N. A. A. C. P. implied. 

First of all, it meant a steady unre- 
mitting stream of messages to branches 
of the Association throughout the 
United States, by telegraph, telephone, 
air mail and special delivery. It meant 
a steady stream of releases to news dis- 
tributing agencies and leading editors 
of influential dailies. It meant keep- 
ing in touch with Washington corre- 
spondents of leading newspaper and 


HAPPENED today to run accrost 

a copy of “Crisis”. It seemed to 
me to a very interesting publication. 

There is one suggestion which I 
think proper to make and that is to 
refrain from “apeing”. By this I 
mean stick to your negro culture and 
develope it. Do not try to intrude 
into the white sphere develope a 
sphere of your own. A pursuit of this 
attitude will bring you the support of 
whites and all sensible negros. Any 
other attitude is disastrous as it is silly 
for any attitude that in any way 
threatens the integrity of Anglo-Saxon 
civilization will subject the negro to 
contempt and all the different forms 
of pressure that are used in such in- 
stances. It is essential that the negro 
keep to himself voluntarily if he does 
hot want to increase white antagonism. 
He should remember that he only con- 
stitutes about 9% of the population

services. It meant keeping tabs on the 
various Senators, notifying people in 
the various states when and how strong 
pressure could be exerted. It meant 
letters to editors urging editoral sup- 
port for the fight, commending their 
endorsement, opposing their influence 
when it threatened to be cast in favor 
of Judge Parker. It meant keeping in 
touch with hosts of people familiar 
with the political situation who could 
make suggestions or themselves exert 
an active influence. Besides this, at 
the very height of the struggle, officers 
of the Association addressed mass meet- 
ings at strategic points: Mr. White in 
Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland; Mr. 
Arthur Spingarn and Dr, Du Bois in 
Philadelphia. 

Discounting the strain of keeping 
such a major political contest in mo- 
tion, the expense alone of it was con- 
siderable. Hundreds of long and ex- 
plicit telegrams had to be sent to keep 
people in distant places informed of 
what they must do and do promptly. 
The long distance telephone had to be 
used constantly to Washington, to 
Philadelphia and to other strategic 
points. 

The National Officers mainly con- 
cerned with this fight, for the time be- 
ing disregarded matters of expense. 
They went ahead and telegraphed and 
telephoned where they felt it to be 
vital and necessary, relying upon col- 


ored people throughout the United 
States to rally to them and help them 
to meet expenses at a time when there 
was literally not time to ask anyone 
for money. Some people realized the 
situation and even without ‘solicitation 
sent in small contributions ‘to help 
carry on the fight. But these were 
only a few. Support on a nation-wide 
and in terms of hundreds of thousands 
is absolutely essential. Colored peo- 
ple and liberal white people have had 
a chance now to see what the Na- 
tional Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People can do in a 
critical situation. It is up to them 
now to help pay the bills, to’ help 
strengthen this instrument which is at 
their service and at the service of all 
who wish to uphold the Constitution 
of the United States in its guarantees 
to minorities. The opportunity is 
here, through the Moorfield Storey- 
Louis Marshall Memorial Campaign, 
to testify to appreciation of what the 
N. A. A. C. P. has done and is still 
doing. The tale will be told when the 
N. A. A. C. P. meets in 21st Annual 
Conference in Springfield, Massachu- 
setts, on June 25. To all who wish 
well to this work the opportunity lies 
open to help and strengthen it. And 
help of a definite, tangible nature, in 
money, is now sorely needed. What 
will you do about it?

I think that would be great and 
wonderful work for such an organiza-

that you and the members of the Asso-

young men and women of the race to 
get a new start in life after once be-

gladly make some effort to help them.

Tue Crisis is a sheer delight. Its 
illustrations alone would make it not- 
able. Why man, the camera is your 
weapon, the answer to all talk about 
the racial inferiority of the Negro. 
Your people not only look as intelligent 
as does the average American—but 
more intelligent. And W. C. Mat- 
ney’s articles show the best grasp of 
sound economic principlés that I have 
comé upon for a long time. 

I must admit, too, that I have here- 
tofore regarded your Association with 
a certain prejudice—not race-prej- 
udice, but political prejudice. This 
was due to what my European corre- 
spondents say of you—that you are not 
so much Black as Red. But I am glad 
to see that you are much blacker than 
painted.

May I presume to comment upon 
two or three points of absorbing in- 
terest in January’s Crisis? The Pre- 
sumption to be excused not by reason 
of the slightest degree .of authority, or 
authoritative knowledge, possessed by 
me, but solely because I am a Negro, 
and, therefore, like any member of any 
race, interested beyond all else in my 
own particular welfare. 

First of all, although it will seem 
like trying to gild the lily in speaking 
of such an obvious fact, the articles 
“Exploitation or Co-operation” by W. 
C. Matney, are magnificent. What a 
brain! What a man! The Magnifi- 
cent Matney. 

Then, D. de Sola Pool, himself, 
might fittingly display the excellent 
qualities of gentlemanliness, aristo- 
cratic dignity and courtesy, by regard- 
ing the utterance of the phrase “this 
Hell of America’, as a calm dispas- 
sionate statement of fact; which it un- 
doubtedly is.

We do appreciate THE CRIsIs so 
much. It grows better and better— 
from cover to cover and typographi- 
cally perfect! A product of 20 years! 
Many of the years were heartbreak- 
ing and disheartening—and compar- 
ing some of those years you are now 
“on top of the world.” We are glad 
and wish you all a successful and pros- 
perous 1930.

I am enclosing check for renewal of 
my subscription for your wonderful 
publication. I get a great deal of 
pleasure in reading this magazine as it 
touches on the things of the greatest 
importance to our group. You seem 
to be able to condense your matter to 
such a degree as to always make it 
interesting reading. Keep up the good 
work and may the next 20 years prove 
as successful as those just past.

I am asking you to please have my 
Crisis well wrapped as everything is 
watched here. Please omit the word 
Crisis on the Wrapper. 

Here I try to fill a dual position 
for the time—principal of the school 
and social worker. I realize now, 
more than ever, what it means to work 
in the South.

Whenever a man does well a piece 
of work for the public good I feel like 
speaking of it while he is yet alive, 
not waiting to speak of it standing 
over his bier. 

The American Negro if he but 
knew it is in several sorts of plight but 
none worse than his economic one. Of 
what good is a college diploma. the 
ballot, or being called ‘Mister’ or 
“Miss,” if one has no job, no money, 
no shelter into which to crawl at night- 
fall? Worse off than the foxes which 
have their holes or the birds with their 
nests. 

The ancients put their emphasis on 
the invisible. Hear them say, “lay up 
your treasures in heaven”, or, “what 
will a man accept in exchange for his 
soul?” But we moderns have more 
hard sense than the ancients had. 
While not entirely neglecting the spir- 
itual, we put our greatest stress on be- 
ing comfortable here below and ask, 
“of what value is it if a man has no 
fresh towel, no changing suit, no mag- 
azine to read?” 

In using his able, analytical mind to 
study the economic difficulties of our 
race, Mr. Matney has acted like a 
wise and modern man. He prescribes 
co-operation as the only way out if we 


get out at all; extensive 
operation. Who can 
such a prescription ? 
Before closing this article I wish to 
make one vain and idle wish: would 
that we Southern Negroes might learn 
how to promote and to maintain eco. 
nomic co-operative enterprises on the 
scale we build churches and society 
halls. ;

Dear Dr. Sherrod: 

I recently saw an old number of the 
Negro Periodical “THe Crisis” jp 
which I also saw your picture and a 
foot note which read “The leading 
Physician of Meridian, Mississippi”. 
You will understand why I am writ. 
ing you since I want to be a doctor 
myself. 

I am a Liberian boy and will be 
twenty years of age the 25th of the 
ensuing July. I have had two years 
of High School training and would 
like to attend school some more to pre- 
pare my self to study medicine. | 
have asked many people about my 
plans to become a doctor and many 
think that I am starting too late. 

Presently I am now earning some 
money to go to America so that | 
might pursue the necessary studies. 

Seeing your name in such a popular 
newspaper as ‘““THE Crisis”, and you 
being one of my own race | thought to 
ask you for your advice in the prem- 
ises since you, too, must have had some 
difficulties in your line of study and 
work. 

Please write me a letter of advice 
if you have the time, and also pardon 
the liberty I take in writing you. | 
simply could not help writing you be- 
cause you should know about this 
business. 

S. RaymMonp Horace,

Perhaps the most interesting sign of 
discrimination I have ever seen in my 
travels over the world is one that is 
both effective and unusually legal. It 
is in a prominent place in a Detroit 
restaurant and is as follows: “Col- 
ored trade NOT desired.” 

The usual effect is I suppose, when 
seen by a colored person, that persons 
pride is hurt with the desired effect 
that he does not remain to be served. 
It is to my mind legal inasmuch as the 
owner does not refuse to serve and if 
called upon will, as he did me, and he 
refused to be drawn into a contro 
versy that would lead to a refusal or 
infraction of the law. 

I draw this to your attention simply 
as a means of possibly anticipating 4 
movement which may and can become 
general all over the United States.

RISIS 





ERRY WALKER did not know 

what it was all about. He made 
no secret of that. To him, the war 
was somebody's else business—and he 
had always been told to mind his own. 
He had a very remote idea that some- 
where across the river and out beyond 
Memphis, somebody was having a war. 
He would have none of it. He hated 
a fight. 

But the man at the Court House in 
Cotton Plant thought differently. 
With a heavy heart and a heavier foot 
Jerry Walker dragged himself into 
Camp Pike. Elijah couldn’t have been 
anv more bewildered when he landed in 
Heaven. The rows and rows of little 
wooden barracks awed him. Marching 
soldiers and barking non-coms terrified 
him. Hustle, bustle, everywhere. 
Jerry was just plumb scared to death. 

The next chapter in Jerry’s life 
might have been entitled “Six Weeks” 
or “From Farm-hand to Dough-boy”’. 
Jerry made a bum soldier. Naturally 
as aggressive as the family cow, one 
other factor contributed to his unhappy 
lot—the top-sergeant. 

“Memphis Bill’, otherwise known 
as First Sergeant William Dade, was a 
born soldier, if soldiering meant the 
love of a fight. Memphis Bill was 
known to pack a punch. Beale Street 
could testify to that. Six foot four in 
his stocking feet, arms dangling to his 
knees, voice sounding like a bass horn 
—thundering, threatening, cussin’, 
what a top-sergeant he did make! Bill 
was a man among men. He also 
thought that he was a man among wo- 
men, too. As a matter of fact, Bill 
had only one real weakness—women. 
He was even more proud of his charm 
and grace among the women, than he 
was of his strength and prowess among 
the men of his acquaintance. 

_ Memphis Bill had taken a hearty dis- 
like to Jerry Walker at first. sight. 
Deep in his subconscious mind, Bill had 
the feeling that somewhere before he 
had met this same Jerry—and there 
was something peculiarly distasteful to 
Bill about the thought. He felt that 
he knew this “aukard, lazy, good-fer- 
nothin’ stiff” as he characterized Jerry, 
but for the life of him, he couldn't fig- 
ure out why or how or where he had 
ever “met up wid de laks of sich trash 
befor’ ”, 

“Whar yo’ frum, sojer?” he had 
roared at Jerry on the occasion of their 
hist meeting in the mess hall. 

Awk’nsaw”, was Jerry’s laconic re-

A Story 
By VICTOR R. DALY 


ply, and from then on Bill knew that 
he disliked Jerry. 

Not long after, Bill had suddenly 
jumped up from a huge boulder on 
which he had been resting by the side 
of the road and marched straight over 
to Jerry, who had seized the few min- 
utes of rest on his first practice hike, 
to remove his shoes. 

“Sojer, yo’ ever been’n Memfis?” he 
had demanded of Jerry. 

“Once’t,” came the meager, disin- 
terested response, and Bill had walked 
back slowly to his boulder shaking his 
head and mumbling to himself. 

The top-sergeant’s dislike for Jerry 
showed itself in many forms. Poor 
Jerry found himself a member of every 
disagreeable detail. “There was no end 
of kitchen police for him. When 
stumps on the drill ground had to be 
grubbed, his was the first name called. 
He never was assigned to guard duty 
in the middle of the week, only on 
Saturdays and Sundays, when the rest 
of the outfit was off duty. Sergeant 
William Dade was relentless in his 
petty persecution of Private Jerry 
Walker. 

Jerry, on the other hand, didn’t ex- 
actly fall in love with the top-sergeant 
at first sight, either. But for that mat- 
ter he didn’t like the lieutenants, or the 
captain, or the army, or the war. He 
hated a fight, although he was no 
coward. He kept repeating to him- 
self that the war was none of his af- 
fair, and he detested everything con- 
nected with it. And because he hated 
the war and the army and the officers 
and the details, most of the top-ser- 
geant’s persecution was absolutely lost 
on Jerry. Since he was there against 
his will anyhow, what difference did 
it make what he was called upon to do. 
Kitchen police was no more disagree- 
able than marching for hours up and 
down the dusty old drill ground, and 
never going anywhere. Just march- 
ing, marching, marching—and never 
arriving! 
pleasure compared to the ridiculous tac- 
tics of flopping down on your stomach 
behind the stumps and stupidly click- 
ing the trigger on your gun as though 
you were shooting at somebody. And 
guard duty was no trouble—it was a 

relief—a relief to get away from every- 
body, and be by himself in some lonely 
patch of woods down by the railroad 
station, or way out by the highway 
gate where only a few stragglers would 
pass all day.

Grubbing stumps was a * 


So most of Memphis Bill’s scheming 
hostility to Jerry went for naught. 
The sergeant listened in vain for the 
first word of complaint or the first sign 
of dissatisfaction on the part of his vic- 
tim—and Jerry’s total indifference just 
further infuriated him. 

“T wish he’d open his mouf, so I 
could mash it’, Bill would sigh to him- 
self. But Jerry never opened it. 

* * * 

“Sergeant, I want you to take a de- 
tail of four men and explore the aban- 
doned communication trench running 
out in front of the Company sector. 
Wait until it gets dark. Don’t go too 
far; but go far enough to contact the 
enemy barbed wire.” 

“Yas suh, Cap’n,” spoke up Sergeant 
Bill Dade, and saluting, turned on his 
heel and strode thoughtfully away. 

“Detail, detail”, he kept mumbling 

to himself, “hyar’s whar I fixes dat 
pol’cat frum Awk’nsaw.” 
“Co’pral, git me two o’ yo’ men right 
quick, an’ hav’em repo’t to mah dug- 
out at once’t,” commanded the top- 
sergeant to the first corporal he could 
find. 

“Hey, yo’, sojer!” roared Bill a few 
minutes later, stepping up behind Pri- 
vate Jerry Walker who leaned absent- 
ly against the parapet of a trench, look- 
ing out into space, wondering what it 
was all about. 

“Git yo’self t’gidder an’ cum ’long 
wid me—stanin’ dar lak Ston’all Jack- 
son! What yo’ starin’ at, anyhow?” 

“Nothin’,” drawled Jerry, looking 
up from his reverie, and glaring into 
the scowling face above him. 

Bill’s brow darkened, and he glow- 
ered at Jerry with an evil eye. That 
crushing right fist itched nervously. 
“Not now,” he mumbled to himself, 
“mah time’ll cum.” 

“Sta’k dem rifles hyar in dis dugout! 
Whar yo’ alls t’inks yo’ alls gwine— 
Berlin?” shouted Sergeant Dade, as he 
lined up his patrol for final instructions 
and inspection. 

The sun had dropped hazily behind 
the wooded peaks of the Vosges several 
hours before, and a cloudy sky gave 
promise of one of those inky, pitch- 
black nights that this sector was noted 
for. Nights that seemed to be hewn 
from ebony itself. Nights on which it 
was impossible to distinguish friend 
from foe. Nights on which it was just 
as dangerous to move around behind 
your own lines as it was behind the 
enemy’s.

“Hurry ’em along, Sergeant, it’s get- 
ting late, and it’s black as Hell out 
here,” came a voice down the steps of 
the dugout. 


“Yas suh, Lootenan’, cumin’,” sang 
out Bill from the depths below. His 
spirits were rising now. He sniffed a 
fight. His huge hob-nailed feet literal- 
ly pawed the ground. Memphis Bill 
was rarin’ to go. 

“Now Co’pral, yo’ an’ yo’ two sojers 
will git into dat trencht as soon as we 
gits pas’ our wire. Mak’ yo’ alls way 
ahaid in singl’ file tru de trencht ’till 
yo’ all gits to de Boshes wire, an’ den 
wait dar fo’ me. Me an’ Big Boy hyar 
frum Awk’nsaw’ll crawl along each 
side o’ de trencht, an’ ef we sees any 
trubl’ ahaid, we'll signal to yo’ all 
down in de trencht fer to stop. Git 
me?” And with that he cast a tri- 
umphant glance in the direction of 
Private Jerry Walker. But as usual, 
the glance was lost for want of a re- 
ceiver. Jerry wasn’t even looking. He 
was barely listening. Certainly he 
wasn’t thinking. He was just there, 
no more, no less. It wasn’t his war— 


and he hated a fight. 


“Ne shootin’,” was the sergeant’s 
final order, “ef we meets up wid any 
Boshes use yer fistes, and dem trencht 
knifes 0’ yourn. Shootin’ never did no- 
body no good, nohow. Use yer fistes!” 
With that he led the way up out of 
the dugout into the inky blackness of 
the night. 

pare: Ge 

“Feld,” a muffled voice whispered in 
a strange tone not three feet from 
where Memphis Bill lay flat on his 
stomach out there in the ebony night. 


“Maus,” came back the other half 
of the pass word from out of the black- 
ness. Bill’s big heart was bumping 
against the ground as his eyes searched 
in vain for the enemy patrol that he 
knew was passing through them. 


If he could only see. If he only knew 
where the rest of his patrol had gone 
to. Where was that big stiff from 
Arkansas hiding? Where was the 
trench? If he only knew what time it 
was. Gee he'd hate to go back and 
face the Captain and the Lieutenant— 
and the men. How they’d snicker and 
laugh behind his back. He, Memphis 
Bill, world-beater, lost—hopelessly, 
helplessly lost. His patrol lost. May- 
be captured by now. Hell! What a 
big bum they’d call him. It must be 
nearly daybreak. How long had he 
been groping around out there in that 
black tomb? Which way was forward 
and which way was backward. These 
and a million similar thoughts were 
torturing the mind of that big hulk 
as it lay there helpless in the pitch 
dark. 


Bill was beaten. Just once before in 


200 





his life he had been beaten, and there 
was nothing to do but take it. He 
would have to stay where he was un- 
til morning. ‘Dam’ sich nights,” he 
swore under his breath. 

Suddenly the sergeant became aware 
of a movement near him. He strained 
his eyes in vain. He strained every 
nerve to pierce the mystery of that veil 
of night. He lay perfectly still—mo- 
tionless. He was tense. Bill was on 
guard, ready to spring at a split-second 
notice, just like a big black panther. 
Was it the enemy patrol returning? 
Was it one of his own men? Was he 
still in No-Man’s Land, or was he ac- 
tually within the enemy lines? 

“Whar d’Hell am I?” he kept ask- 
ing himself. 

But nothing appeared out of the 
darkness for him to spring upon, and 
gradually the sergeant relaxed to await 
the coming of dawn. The rest of the 
night passed quietly. 

Gradually, Sergeant Dade began to 
recognize objects about him. Care- 
fully, quietly, he reconnoitered his posi- 
tion. Quickly he realized that he 
couldn’t stay where he was much 
longer. He found himself perched on 
top of a grassy knoll that was plainly 
visible from the surrounding hills, some 
of which were less than two hundred 
yards away. But the factor that both- 
ered the patrol leader most at that mo- 
ment, was which way led to safety. 
Now that it was getting light and he 
could see, he was ready to go, but he 
had no place to go. 

In that particular sector in the 
Vosges, battle-lines were not clearly de- 
fined. Both sides had entrenched them- 
selves at strategic points throughout the 
heavily wooded hills, and were satisfied 
to adopt a policy of watchful waiting. 
It was known as a quiet sector. New 
troops were sent there by both sides to 
learn the art of war under the most 
favorable circumstances. Patrolling 
was the most active form of encounter. 
In some places the mythical lines were 
a half a mile apart, at other points they 
came as close as one hundred and fifty 
yards, depending solely on the nature 
of the terrain. 

That’s why Bill Dade was so com- 
pletely lost. He couldn’t tell one hill 
from another. ‘Why doan dey hang 
out a flag or sumptin’ so a guy c’n tell 
whar he’s at,” thought Bill as the hope- 
lessness of his situation dawned upon 
him with the morning light. He failed 
to recognize a single landmark that 
would give him the slightest clue to his 
whereabouts. But he had to get off 
that knoll. 

In one direction the knoll sloped 
gently to a large open field that evi- 
dently had been used as pasture land 
before the war. For Bill. to venture 
forth into that open field would have 


been disastrous if any of the surround- 
ing hills were occupied by the Boche. 
Snipers, who were constantly on the 
lookout high up in the tree-tops, would 
spot him as soon as the morning haze 
lifted from the valley. You never 
could tell in those hills and woods 
when snipers were taking aim on you 
—and since it was a one-shot game, 
they rarely missed. In the opposite 
direction the knoll sloped much more 
abruptly, and was practically covered 
by a growth of young pine. This side 
of the hill had at one time or another 
been under shell fire, as a number of 
broken trees and ragged shell-holes tes- 
tified. At the foot of the slope about 
a hundred feet distant was the dried 
bed of a brook, from which the steep 
sides of another thickly wooded hill 
arose. The sergeant saw that this dried 
stream bed at the foot of both slopes, 
offered him the best shelter for the 
present. Gathering his six foot four 
together, Bill set out on his hands and 
knees, moving cautiously and silently. 
When he reached the foot of the slope 
his eye fell upon a small section of the 
bank that had been undercut by the 
force of the water years ago. Exposed 
roots of overhanging trees in front of 
this section of the bank furnished ideal 
support tor the honeysuckle and other 
vines that formed a perfect mesh across 
the opening of the undercut bank. Here 
was a perfectly screened cave. Ser- 
geant Dade felt for the first time in 
many hours that luck had come his 
way. He would keep watch from this 
hiding place until dusk, hoping that by 
then something would happen to give 
him some idea of where he was in re- 
spect to the war. 


Once more he resumed his crawling 
tactics. Finally he reached the vines 
hanging in front of the cave. Just as 
he was about to part them and peer in, 
he was struck by the sound of a familiar 
voice from within. 

“Cum in befo’ yo’ brings de whole 
army wid yo’.” 

There sat Private Jerry Walker ot 
Arkansas, atop a huge round stone. 

“Fer cryin’ in de sink!” was Bill’s 
hushed exclamation. 

“Whar’s de Co’pral?” he excitedly 
continued. 

“T dunno.” 

“Whar’s dem sojers 0’ his’n?” 

“T dunno.” 

“Whar’s dat ar trencht we cum out 
in?” 

“T dunno.” Z 

“Yo’ doan know much, does yo’? 
Bill added sarcastically. 

“No, but I ain’t los’.” 

At that moment the duli roar of a 
squadron of planes overhead brought 
both men sharply to the realization that 
this was neither the time nor the place 
for argument.

LISTS 





“What I wants t’ know mos’,”” con- 
tinued the sergeant, some minutes later, 
in an almost friendly manner, “is which 
one o’ dem hills is de one we cum over 

s’ night?” 

a it stan’s,” nodded Jerry de- 
cisively, in the direction of a sparsely 
covered hill about a couple of hundred 
yards across the valley. 

" “How yo’ know?” eagerly spoke up 
the gent from Memphis, parting the 
vines and peering out enthusiastically. 

“Cyz I staid up atop o’ it all night, 
‘till I crawls down hyar dis mornin’.” 

“Well, fool, whatcher cum dis way 
fo’; why yo’ didn’t crawl back d’udder 
way whar we cums frum?” 

“Cuz I seen one o’ dem Boshes wan- 
d’rin’ roun’ out dar—look lak t’ me he 
was los’, too—an’ cuz | wasn’t after 
gittin’ mix’d up wid ’im, I cums on dis 
way ‘till it gits dark, den I’se gwine 
ba’k”. 

This was the longest speech that 
Jerry Walker had made since he joined 
the armed forces of his Uncle Samuel. 
It seemed to leave him exhausted for he 
lapsed into a grave-like silence. The 
sergeant, satisfied now that he would 
be able to make his way back to his 
outtit soon after dark, stretched himself 
out at full length on the ground, and 
gradually went off to sleep. The day 
wore on uneventfully. Bill slept off 
and on, while Jerry kept watch. 

Finally, refreshed by several hours 
of sleep and a little water from his 
canteen, Memphis Bill aroused himself. 
He was in better spirits now. He cast 
his gaze in the direction of his room- 
mate who was as motionless as the stone 
on which he sat. Bill felt grateful. He 
knew that he owed his chance of get- 
ting back safely to his outfit, to this 
same soldier for whom he had devel- 
oped such a strong dislike. 

“After all,” thought Bill, “he ain’t 
never done nuthin’ t’me.” 

“When we gits ba’k to de States,” 
said the sergeant in the friendliest 
voice, “I wants yo’ to stop off wid me 
in Memfis an’ meet sum o’ mah gals.” 

“I doan lak Memfis,” replied Jerry 
breaking his long silence. 

“Watcher know ’bout Memfis?” 
queried Bill, his voice still friendly, and 
his eyes sparkling at the thought of the 
figure he’d cut when he returned to 
Beale Street in his First Sergeant’s 
uniform and his swagger stick. 

Been dar once’t, an’ gits into a fite. 
Ain never gwine dar no mo’!” 

-Tell me ’bout it, Big Boy,” pleaded 
Bill sympathetically. 

And then Jerry, in a low voice, after 
some hesitation, told the story of his 
one trip to Memphis. And Bill sat 
there on the floor of their cave looking 
up at him in wide-eyed amazement. 

Jerry told how he had gone to Mem- 
Pils on an excursion boat, one Sunday 


June, 1930 


about a year before the war. 
had wandered about the big city most 
of the day, sight-seeing, and finally 
wound up late in the afternon in a 


How he 


Beale Street cafe. The place had 
been crowded with hungry excursion- 
ists, who were trying to get something 
to eat before the boat started back on 
its trip down the river. Seated atop 
a high stool at the lunch counter, 
Jerry was suddenly startled by the 
shrill scream of a woman, followed by 
the sound of blows to the accompani- 
ment of curses and shouts. Looking 
about him in dismay, he realized that a 
fight had started at a table in the cor- 
ner and was rapidly progressing in his 
direction. As the crowd of non-com- 
batants gave way before the approach 
of the fighters, Jerry from his perch 
on the stool, could see that three of the 
excursionists appeared to be battling 
with a huge man, who seemed to be 
getting the better of the scrap, in spite 
of the odds against him. Jerry’s heart 
had been made sick by this desecration 
of the Sabbath—and he hated a fight 
anyhow. The huge man kept his op- 
ponents at bay as he slowly backed his 
way toward the door. Both fists were 
lashing out skull-crushing blows, and 
his opponents continued their attacks 
from a respectful distance. Finally the 
battlers had reached a place near where 
Jerry was perched at the counter. The 
huge fighter’s back was almost touch- 
ing Jerry. He made a terrific lunge at 
his nearest assailant, and floored him 
with a hay-making right uppercut. But 
in so doing he lost his own footing on 
the greasy floor and slipped to his knees, 
almost under Jerry’s stool. Then Jerry 
told how he had been seized with a 
sudden, mad frenzy to end this dis- 
gusting fight. Looking about him, he 
grabbed with both hands a huge earth- 
en crock half full of waffle batter and 
brought it down with all his force upon 
the head of the massive fighter, who 
was just about to rise off one knee. 

Momentarily dazed by this sudden 
attack from a new quarter, and partial- 
ly blinded by the messy batter that en- 
gulfed him from the broken crock, the 
giant fighter was easily subdued by his 
remaining two opponents who were 
still on their feet. Once inside of that 
deadly right, they flung their combined 
weight against him and thrashed him 
within an inch of his life. When 
Jerry left the cafe several minutes later, 
they were loading this Colossus of 
Clout into a hospital ambulance. 

“’T wasn’t dat I had anyt’ing agin’ 
dat man,” Jerry concluded, “I never 
seen him befo’ nor sence, but I jest 
nateraly hates a fite, an’ I wanted fer 
to stop dem frum fitin’.” 

Sergeant William Dade sat through 
this recital absolutely speechless. He 
seemed to be drinking in every word 





that fell from Jerry’s lips. Toward the 
end, he sat rigid and fixed, like a bird 
in the charm of a snake. That clenched, 
crushing right fist itched nervously. 
He remembered that fight perfectly. 
He could taste that batter yet! 

Suddenly there was a sound just out- 
side their hiding place. Yes—another 
and another. They could hear the 
breaking of small twigs, but they 
couldn’t see anything. Inside the cave 
was the stillness of death. Neither man 
dared move. Jerry sat on the edge of 
his stone. Bill was on his hands and 
knees, ready to spring—like a wild cat. 
He was afraid that the thumping of 
his heart would give them away. He 
tried to see through the labyrinth of 
vines, but there was nothing to see. 
He was just about to speak when a 
huge frame darkened the front of their 
cave. From his place on the ground 
Sergeant Dade could see the shoes and 
the leggings of the man standing not 
two feet away from him. He was a 
Boche. 

One second’s reflection was all that 
Memphis Bill needed. He would 
carry that Boche back alive to his out- 
fit if he had to whip the whole Ger- 
man army one by one. It would ab- 
solve him from his sin of getting lost 
on patrol. It would restore his stand- 
ing with the Lieuténant, with the Cap- 
tain, and above all, with the men. It 
would make him a hero instead of a 
goat. 

So without the slightest considera- 
tion for his companion, Bill made up 
his mind. He waited a moment until 
the soldier moved away from the cave 
entrance, and then he suddenly 
emerged from his hiding. As he 
straightened up he was confronted with 
the biggest man that he had ever seen 
in his life. The German was dumb- 
founded. He was also unarmed. And 
as his enemy made no effort to draw 
the automatic that dangled from his 
belt, the Teuton saw that he had a 
chance, and he cleared for action. 
Quick as a flash he sized up his oppo- 
nent; he realized from Bill’s bulk and 
the determined look in his eyes that 
this was no mean adversary. So he was 
prepared for the terrific right upper- 
cut that just missed his chin by an eye- 
lash. Like lightning itself, he whipped 
over a left hook that caught the as- 
tounded Bill flush on the jaw. The 
gent from Memphis shook the cob-webs 
from his brain as it slowly dawned 
upon him that he had met rhore than 
his match. So there they stood in that 
quiet, peaceful valley, in the gathering 
dusk, toe to toe, the Bavarian butcher 
and the stevedore from Memphis, trad- 
ing punches, blow for blow. Bill real- 
ized that the Boche could take it and 
the Boche could give it, too. The Ger-

Rhode Island School of Design. The 
committee in accepting the bust as a 
part of the permanent collection 
writes: 

“It is a pleasure indeed to have this 
fine piece of sculpture in the collec- 
tions, and it will mean very much to 
have one of our able graduates rep- 
resented by this head.” 

This Museum is just occupying a 
new building and has in all lines of 
art work one of the finest collections in 
America. L. Earl Rowe is the Di- 
rector.

among other things,—‘‘America faces 
a vast opportunity to set up for the 
world a compelling example of right 
inter-racial and international relation- 
ships. If America should, by any sin- 
ister fate, fail to give reality and 
power to the ideals of a Christian 
democracy, mankind will be commit- 
ted to the horror of interminable con- 
flict. Peace will be impossible, and 
civilization itself threatened with 


collapse. Everything depends upon 


the degree of success with which we 
teach our children now that all na- 
tions are worthy, and all men equal.”

casket factories, 3 embalming fluid 
plants, and 3 other plants for various 
supplies all conducted by Negroes. 
There is one trade journal. 
@ In San Antonio, Texas, Mrs. Ida 
Hutchinson was arrested and put in 
jail because she would not sit on the 
left-hand of the back seat of a City 
bus. The bus owner contended that 
Negroes must not only sit on the rear 
seat, but on the extreme left. Judge 
Watson decided that if the Public Ser- 
vice did not want the Negroes to occu- 
py the entire rear seat they should put 
a barrier in the middle. Mrs. Hutch- 
inson was discharged in spite of the 
fact that she was accused of claiming 
membership in the N. A. A. C. P. “an 
organization attempting to break down 
‘Jim Crow’ laws in the South!” 
WEST INDIES 
@ The present government of Haiti 
allows laborers on public works $1 a 
day. Thomas T. Tucker of Union 
Baptist. Church, Newark, declares 
“As a matter of fact the laborers get 
40 and 50 cents a day and the white 
Americans get the rake-off”’. 
@ Aclergyman working in the Island 
of Haiti writes to a friend of ours un- 
der date of March 22d, “Of course, 
you have read about all our political 
troubles out here. The terrible things 
in La Croix-Marche-a-terre where the 
marines killed some thirty country 
people without any reason. I saw the 
awful deed with my two eyes. May 
God forgive them for their sins!” 
( Conditions of unemployment are 
stated to be very bad in the West 
Indies, and particularly in British 
Guiana. Recently a huge demonstra- 
tion of the unemployed was made in 
the presence of the Governor. 
@ The Monthly Bulletin published 
by the Financial Advisor of Haiti 
showed total revenue receipts of $696,- 
600 for the month of February which 
is a decrease of about 1% as compared 
with 1929, and 28% as compared with 
1928. The gross public debt is stated 
to be $16,776,000. Foreign com- 
merce shows a decline of 21% in the 
last year. Seventy-one per cent of 
Haiti's imports are from the United 
States, while France buys over half of 
her products. 
¢ Governor Waldo Evans of the 
Virgin Isles is taking a trip through 
British West Indies. With him is the 
colored band organized by Alton A. 
Adams. Mr. Adams with the band 
once visited the United States. 
¢ One of the funny occurrences in the 
Haitian embroglio was the recent at- 
tempt of Commissioner Russell to have 
distinguished Haitians attend a recep- 
tion which he gave March first. Some 
or the answers are interesting: Sey- 
mour Pradel answers “The distressing 


June, 1930 


condition of my country prevents me 


from entering your doors”. Placide 
David writes “Under the present sor- 
rowful circumstances you will easily 
understand why I decline the honor, 
which you have done me”. Schiller 
Nicolas says: “It is certainly an error 
that I am the object of your thought”. 
Francois Mathon says, “I am a part 
of that national community which ‘has 
the mentality of a child of seven years’ 
and my country has undergone for 
fifteen years the iniquitous oppression 
of which you and yours are the respon- 
sible agents. As a Haitian my place 
is not at your house and your invita- 
tion to come there mystifies me. I re- 
fuse it”. Louis Raymond says “In re- 
sponse to your strange invitation | 





Colonel Spencer Dickerson 
(Page 204) 


would have you know that M. Louis 
Raymond does not hold intercourse 
with the enemies of his country”. 
Jacques Roumain writes ‘““The Negro 
Jacques Roumain does not deign to 
visit white folks”. Maurice Chalmers 
says “The High Commissioner has 
surely made a mistake. As the grand- 
son of slaves I refuse to be present at 
a new edition of the Rochambeau 
Ball”. Lucien Lafontant writes “I 
believe that your invitation to Madam 
Lafontant and myself must have been 
a mistake, but there is no mistake in 
my refusal to accept it”. Antonio 
Vieux writes ‘““No one worthy of the 
name of a Haitian would consent to 
be the guest of the High Commissioner 
after the drama of Charlemagne 
Péralte; Benoit Batraville; 3,500 dead 
Cacos and the massacre of Marche-a- 
terre.” 


WEST AFRICA 
@ Mary Slessor was a pioneer mis- 
sionary at Calabar, West Africa. She 
was born in Scotland in 1848 and was 





a mill worker. Inspired by the death 
of Dr. Livingstone she went to Africa 
in 1876 and began a long fight against 
superstition and _ witchcraft. Her. 
house became a refuge for twins which 
by native custom were killed, and she 
built a mission home and a school. She 
settled disputes, fought drinking, and 
in 1905 was officially appointed Vice 
President of the Native Court at Iko- 
tobung. She died in 1915 and is still 
a legend over 200,000 square miles 
where she was known as “Ma”. 

@ Brigadier-General Sir Frederick 
Gordon Guggisberg, Governor of 
British Guiana is dead in Canada. He 
was trained as a soldier and served in 
Africa and the East. He became 
Governor of the Gold Coast in 1919, 
and served until 1927. He was 
friendly to the Negroes and especially 
helped in education. 

@ Clifford Wharton, former Secre- 
tary of the American Legion at Mon- 
rovia, and afterward assistant to the 
consul at Calais, France, has been ap- 
pointed U. S. Minister to Liberia. The 
Senate has refused to increase his sal- 
ary from $5,000 to $10,000 as recom- 
mended by the President. Neverthe- 
less, the President may make special 
allowance for expenses. 

@ It has been estimated that the 
known mineral production of the 
French Colonies amounts to $44,000,- 
000 a year. The minerals consist of 

phosphate, iron ore, coal, lead, zinc, 

copper, graphite, oil and gold. 

@ Detailed reports of the National 

Congress of British West Africa at 

Lagos, Nigeria give a synopsis of the 

speech of the President, Mr. Casely 

Hayford. He stated that the eyes of 

British West Africa are beginning to 

open to her disabilities. Since the 

First Congress in 1920, limited fran- 

chise has been granted to Nigeria, 

Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast. 

The privilege has not yet been granted 

to Gambia. The founding of Achi- 

mota College is due to a resolution 

passed by Congress, as is also the estab- 

lishment of a West African Appeal 

Court with criminal jurisdiction. This, 

however, is not enough. Limited 

franchise must be extended and the 

majority of the councils must be 

elected. The Congress is also inter- 

ested in African Nationhood. The eco- 

nomic question of proper return for 

African labor is of great importance 

and there must be an_ educational 

awakening. 


EAST AFRICA 
@ It is expected that Ras Tafari will 
soon assume the title of King of the 
Kings of Ethiopia and Emperor of 
Abyssinia. 
@ One of the greatest steps being 
taken by Abyssinia is the dam which is 


205 


The Dixwell Players in “The Dreamy Kid”, page 203. 


to be built at Lake Tsana. This lake 
is the headwaters of the Blue Nile 
and this controls much of the flow of 
water through the Sudan. By arrange- 
ment with Great Britain, Abyssinia 
has given the contract to an American 
firm, the White Engineering Cor- 
poration of New York City. 

@ At Gordon Memorial College, 
Khartoum, Sudan, there are at present 
520 students enrolled. The main sup- 
port comes from the Sudan Govern- 
ment which contributes $300,000 a 
year. 

@ Count Louis Konigsegg, explorer, 
and big game hunter is dead at Buda- 
pest. He lived in Abyssinia for seven 
years and married the sister of 
the Emperor Menelik. After her 
death he returned to Hungary. He 
lost his fortune in the War and then 
wrote several novels. 


SOUTH AFRICA 

@ When Dr. C. T. Loram was in 
America in 1929 he induced the Rocke- 
feller Institute to offer $325,000 to 
the Government of the Union of South 
Africa to provide medical training for 
the natives. The Government has not 
yet accepted the offer. 

@ Dr. T. T. Barnard, Professor of 
Anthology at the University of Cape- 
town has said lately with regard to 
“Segregation” and “developing the na- 
tive on his own lines” that “‘in the end, 
whatever means we take to avoid it, 
the African people will take over the 
civilization of the West... . You and 
I and every European in Africa, con- 
sciously, or unconsciously are taking 
part in a prodigious social experiment: 
the displacing of African tribal life by 
the civilization which we still call 
Western and European which is rap- 
idly becoming, for all its imperfection, 
the civilization of the world.” He 
called Jan Smuts’ Oxford 
“downright nonsense’. 

@ The Native Affairs Act of 1920 of 
the Union of South Africa established 
a Native Affairs Commission. This 
Commission was to obtain views of 
natives before laws effecting them were 
passed. It must consist of not more 


206 


address 


than five members, and by custom these 
have always been white men. Dur- 
ing the last few years the Government 
has not summoned this Commission 
and the Commission has made no re- 
port to Parliament. 

@ The Fourth Annual Conference 
of the South African Native Farmers 
Conference was held last December 


near Butterworth. C. Sakwe was 
elected President for the next two 
years, and D. D. T. Jabavu, Secre- 
tary. 

@ The Prime Minister of South 
Africa and General Smuts have agreed 
to send the Native Bills to a select 
Committee before reporting them for 
a second reading.

Harlem Ending 
By ROBERT SCHLICK 
HE sun these afternoons in Harlem 
s 
In al sad splendor suddenly 
Down the wan wintry west; here violet 
roofs, 
Tan tinted, foretell evening, that Man- 
hattan s 
Silently waits the stillness of the moon, 
And vastest peace after material zeal. 
The village, old New Harlem, it had too 
The same sun swung the same way west, 
and moons ; 
To pour milk loving kindness down, and 
roofs 
Since antiquated, which the Dutchman 
built 
Beside the quiet of his rural farms. 
Daily communication with the city 
Magically sprung at the far island’s end, 
Where East and Hudson sift their 
waters with 
The soft orange ocean, brought that city 
up, 
Transforming Harlem, so the town be- 
came 
A metropolis, a populous section. 


AR with its brazen 
brought world changes. 
Lured by the war time wages, thousands 


trumpets 


came 

From various colored races south or 
west— 

With all their dreams and beauties in- 
terspersed, 


Dropped upon Harlem like dark legions 
of 
Angels with silver ladders in their hands 
With which they might ascend at any in- 
stant 
To the still region of their native soul, 
Resound in mighty chorus “Hallelu- 
jahs”’— 
Safe with-black God wherever the glad 
body was. 
And thus the evening brings its music of 
Pale moonlight on the restless avenues. 
Here walk the people, dark and dim they 
pass. 
The night is on their shoulders, and their 
faces show 
Subtle illuminations, festive things 
The very opposite of secretness, 
uminous joy. The younger genera- 
tion 
Flies on its way to talk excitedly 
Of intellectualities and art, , 
at art is art sans race, that mind obeys 
Infinite laws lodged in all dreaming 
rains— 
If Afric, magic in the Cameroons, 
est Indian, then erected tall and soft, 
t supple as the Caribbean seas: 
t, under Dixie skies bred, born full 
f melancholy making poetry, then, 


In Harlem where the artist gathers 
ome. 


June, 1930 


UEER throbbing Cuban music, danc- 
ing rumbas 
To stir the sluggish pulse with ecstacies ; 
Or South Sea Island girls to elevate 
Sheer beauty into sheer beatitude, 
Their long black braided hair and cheeks 


flush-rose 


And olive like the surfs on southern 
shores; 

Or widest striking strides of gaity, 

From Mississippi spreading east and 
west, 

The individual lyric of the blues; 

And the cultural ease of the ancient 


spirituals 
Lulling the world with folk-lore weld 
with God, 


Out of completed empire from the 
South: 

These some, not all, the contributions 
from 


The plastic, living, and alivest mind 

Of the unemptiable natures African 

Seen, sensed, and known in Harlem. 
Here, ideals, 

Preponderantly American, take hold, 

Extending to the borders of the world, 

Those precious gifts of great belief and 
joy, 

They symbolize. Such cosmopolitan hymn 

Was meant to be the mission of mankind, 

That all around appears in Harlem here 

Unfettered and unhampered, and _be- 
comes 

The liberal justice of the body-soul 

Shrouded in colors of close beauteous- 
ness. 


HE dedicated essences crop out 
Harmonious; the dim idealisms 
Floed through the doubtful population 
with 

The glorious semblance of pale hope; 
the brain 

Reeling with laughter, faces the cold 
world 

With new assurances next periods shall 

Release the privilege of equality, 

Of universal brotherhood again. 

From afternoon to evening, the sun goes 

Down lovely Harlem leaving moons and 
dreams, 

A trail of chariot memories, and day 
ends. 


HE world is everywhere alike. 
As mankind congregates, all soul is 
close, 
Potential, if not actual, in the air 
Drifting across earth’s faces and deep 
eyes 
A perfume to the sensitive breather’s nos- 
trils, 
A fire in Voodoo: but a difference is— 
Some races more aesthetic are most elect 
To speak of spirit and man’s deepest feel- 
ing: 
The Negro has, nor can do anything 
That lacks, glad mass. Those problems 
sown 


With every human grouping, challenge 
here 

Also in Harlem; with lewd poverty 

The cause of effort to eradicate it: 

And yet a bouyant joy springs clearly 


through 

The slowly measured movement in the 
streets;— 

Like nowhere on Manhattan, joy does 
here; 


With race ideals being nurtured heat- 
edly 

So purely as to be a part of mind, 

Not theory like the habit of some men, 

But beauty as the very flesh of truth. 


White Flowers 
By CLARISSA BUCKLIN 


j? seems that all the flowers I remem- 
ber this spring have been white. 
Why have I noticed the white flowers 

more than the rest? 
Surely there have been others besides 
these cold, sweet, white flowers. 
There must have been tulip and violet, 
lilac and rose; 

I do not remember. 

There was a white hyacinth fluttering a 
veil of perfume and beauty 

At the window of a sick-room in bleak 
February; 

A narcissus made March lovely for a 
day; 

Then cherry trees in bloom, purer than 
snowflakes ; 

Spirea, called bridal wreath, carved for 
the springtime’s own wedding; 
White iris, blue veined, like mist around 

a pool; 
Now snowballs and fragrant syringa 
Flowering for graves on Memorial Day; 
And catalpa in trees, and lovely white 
clover. 
It is queer that I should remember only 
the white flowers. 
Were there so many? 





God is Kind

He lets us dream 
Of untarnished silver 
Of skies that have never known 
The pain of a storm 7 
Of the peace and contentment 
In a robin’s even song.

Without its aftermath 
Of loneliness . . 


God

Of unattainable things!

His Question 


OU are small and shy, and round, 
And you are lovely to see: 

How would your dusky brown skin 
turn, 

If I should say to you— 

There is nothing more for me than you, 

And your smile so filled with sun; 

Beaming shyly down on me 

Like dreams unfolding one by one?

Her Reply 


F there’s nothing more for thee 

’Cept smiles and idle gaze of me; 
And thou a foot mat like a slave 
Content to be a simple knave: 
To thee who never sought to fight, 
For me, or love, or law, or right; 
Thou’l’t never make for me a man 
But live and die as thou began. 
Good timber does not grow in ease; 
The stronger wind, the tougher trees; 
By sun and cold, by rain and snows, 
In tree or man good guerdon grows. 
Where thickest stands the forest growth 
We find the patriarchs of both, 
And they hold converse with the stars; 
Their broken branches show the scars 
Of many winds and much of strife— 
This, Sir, is common law of life. 


THE LIFE OF JAMES WELDON 
JOHNSON 


AMES WELDON JOHNSON 

was born in Jacksonville, Florida, 
June 17, 1871, where with his brother 
J. Rosamond, he spent his childhood 
days. 

He spent seven years completing his 
high school and college careers. While 
he was teaching school, he studied law 
and passed his examination, though his 
race and color made it difficult for 
him to secure admittance to the bar. 

After seven years he left the teach- 
ing in which he had been engaged and 
came with his brother to New York, 
where he spent many years in studying 
music and writing. Finally he ac- 
cepted the position of Consul at Puerto 
Cabello, Venezuela. Later, he was 
moved to Corinto, Nicaragua. The life 
led in Corinto was entirely different 
from his life in New York. 

The next position which he accept- 
ed was Secretary of the National Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People. 

After he completed the investigation 
of the Negro in Haiti, his attention was 
turned toward the “Jim-Crowing” and 
lynching of the Negro in the United 
States. He began this work in 1915. 
He spent two years endeavoring to se- 
cure passage of the “Dyer Anti-Lynch- 
ing Bill”. There was a tendency to 
delay the bill. He encountered many 
difficulties. By investigating and learn- 
ing facts on this lynching problem he 
was able to write many illuminating 


pages on it. The members of the House ° 


and people of the country began to look 








into the affair. The Dyer Anti. 
Lynching Bill did not become a law. 
but the whole nation became interested 
and murders gradually decreased. 

Johnson is a very quiet man of mid- 
dle age. He has a slender figure and 
long delicate fingers. His strange ey- 
pressive gray-green eyes are his most 
outstanding feature. His charm and 
friendliness are noticed by all who meet 
him. 

Music has always played an im. 
portant part in Johnson’s career, The 
first song written by James and Rosa- 
mond was “Lift Every Voice and 
Sing”. This song is now the National 
Negro Hymn. Another popular song 
written by them was ‘The Congo Love 
Song”. 

He has written many books. Some 
of his best are “The Book of Negro 
Spirituals”, ‘“God’s Trombones”, and 
“The Autobiography of An Ex-Col- 
ored Man”. 

James Weldon Johnson is a man to 
be given great praise. He has worked 
to secure the Negro his civil rights in 
every part of the United States. His 
name is among the great Negroes who 
have struggled for and achieved success.

THAT ARCHITECTURAL LIE 


E have at last heard from Mr. 
Whitney Warren, Director of 
the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design.” 
He writes this as follows: 
“Undoubtedly from the evidence in 
your letter of March 31st, with which 
I was not familiar, the reference to 
the French Government in the an- 
nouncement of the Fontainebleau 
School is in error. As to its origin, 
[ am ignorant, but was conscious of its 
presence and am therefore responsible. 
“This reference in view of what 
your letter contains, will be suppressed 
in future.” 
“Whitney Warren.” 
This would close the matter if it 
were not for our inconvenient memory. 
We have a recollection, that is far 
from dim, that in 1923 a black Ameri- 
can girl with high recommendations 
secured a scholarship at this same Fon- 
tainebleau School. The school was 
sponsored by the National Academy of 
Design, the Architectural League, the 
Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, the 
Mural Painters, the National Sculptors, 
and the Society of Beaux-Arts Archi- 
tects. On the Advisory Committee of 
this school were Ernest C. Peixotto, 
Edwin H. Blashfield, Howard Green- 
ley, Thomas Hastings, J. Monroe 
Hewlett, Herman A. McNeil, James 
Gamble Rogers and Whitney Warren. 


When these organizations learned 
that Augusta Savage was black they 
withdrew the scholarship. At that 
time THe Crists wrote to all the men 
mentioned above. Peixotto wrote in- 
directly but frankly that the Advisory 
Committee did not think it would be 
“wise to have a colored student.” 
Chomas Hastings declared he had no 
sympathy “with barring Miss Savage ;” 
Edward Blashfield was “not present” 
at the meeting ; James Gamble Rogers 
sid that they had to discriminate be- 
cause they needed “sponsors” for the 
enterprise, etc. The one man who re- 
tused to answer or to explain his posi- 
ton in any respect was Whitney War- 
Ten, 

We have a suspicion, and we are fol- 
lowing the matter up, that the Ameri-

can sponsors for 
School, being willing to draw the color 
line and not having the moral courage 
to assume responsibility themselves for 
it, tried to shoulder it on the French 


the Fontainebleau 


Government. The French Govern- 
ment has politely declined to accept 
any such responsibility. What we are 
trying to find out now is who is re- 
sponsible for drawing the color line 
ir, this American school of France? 


NEVAL THOMAS 


EVAL THOMAS, late President 

of the District of Columbia 
Branch of the N. A. A. C. P., was a 
man of courage, enthusiasm and faith. 
He never hesitated to protest against 
color discrimination. He never 
doubted but what protest and publicity 
would bring the righting of wrong. 
He could be depended upon to fight 
discrimination in public schools, segre- 
gation in Government departments, 
and apathy among the rank and file of 
his own people. It was but natural 
that his judgment did not always equal 
his courage, and that he was impatient 
with those who walked less surely and 
swiftly toward the goals that he en- 
visaged. Particularly, in his latter 
days, when failing health harassed him, 
he often spoke harsh words of criticism 
against those who in their own way 
were working for the same ends as he. 
This was but human. We shall re- 
member, now that Neval Thomas is 
gone, only the blazing fervor of his 
indictments, and the fact that he was 
one of the few Negroes in the United 
States willing at all times to jeopardize 
his own bread and butter for a high 
principle. 


ATHLETICS IN NEGRO 
COLLEGES 


¢e()UITE a hubbub was raised last 

season by Mordecai Johnson’s 
attempt to purge the lists at Howard 
of those students who were not main- 
taining scholastic efficiency. The rabid 
sport lovers the country over were at- 
tacking Johnson as an enemy of ath- 
letics. I believe, however, that there 
were enough people back of his pro- 
gram to render it effective. But to 





turn to the Southeast. Two months 
ago THe Crisis carried some notes on 
the football season as observed by a 
competent referee. In the course of 
these observations there appeared the 
fact (there is no doubting it) that 
Tuskegee had not lost a game! I ask, 
why should she? Has she not kept the 
same team practically intact for six 
or seven years? ‘The name Stevenson 
has appeared in Tuskegee’s lineup for 
no less than six years. Unless there is 
a radical change of policy, it will ap- 
pear next year. 

“But here is the joker. Fisk, Knox- 
ville, Atlanta, Talladega and More- 
house pulled out of the old associa- 
tion in the Southeast, which included 
‘Tuskegee, to form an association of 
colleges pledged to observe the ordi- 
nary rules limiting competition to 
three or four years, maintaining a one- 
year eligibility rule and so on. When 
Atlanta merged with Morehouse, Fisk 
engaged the former coach at Atlanta 
and he came with half his team and 
established for Fisk, according to the 
same issue of THE Crisis, ‘the fastest 
team in colored football’. Well, I ask, 
why should it not be the fastest? One 
of the all-star players was a sensation 
with St. Paul School in the C. I. A. A. 
for a period of five years, ending with 
his graduation in 1927; after which 
he competed one year for Atlanta be- 
fore going to Fisk. Another player, 
picked as all-star quarterback, was at 
Virginia Seminary for four years and 
at Atlanta two years before becoming 
the pivot of the Fisk team. Another 
“special” student (doing graduate 
work) at Fisk took his degree from 
Morehouse in 1924, competed for 
Tennessee A. & I. State College in 
1928-’29, and at length played on the 
Fisk teams. The list is longer and 
could be carried out in other colleges, 
but I restrict myself to the larger 
schools. 

“The Colored Intercollegiate Ath- 
letic Association (C. I. A. A.) com- 
prising those colleges and schools that 
stretch along the Eastern coast from 
Washington to North Carolina, in- 
cluding also Lincoln and Bluefield In- 
stitute, has and enforces a rule that 
restricts competition to four years. 
They likewise make a player ineligible 


209 


who transfers from one association 
team to another, for a period of one 
year. This does not apply to athletes 
who have played outside the associa- 
tion. Such men are always welcome. 
Last season Lincoln played in its regu- 
lar lineup a man who was for four 
vears a star performer at a Catholic 
college in Northern Ohio. 

“Now that Negro colleges are being 
admitted to the associations of stand- 
ard colleges, and even now are debat- 
ing with these colleges and universities, 
it is even possible that some Negro col- 
lege will play games with the mem- 
bers of the ‘Big Ten’ or some other 
Carnegie-investigated groups. I won- 
der if we will have the nerve to say 
that ‘Chicago exhibited great racial 
prejudice in refusing to play unless 
Fisk benched Brown, her mainstay in 
the backfield for the last ten years?’ ” 


(The Editor cannot vouch for the 
truth of all the above allegations, but 
they call for answer or denial. The 
columns of THE CRISIS are open. ) 


ANOTHER SYMPOSIUM 

OME of our friends in St. Louis 

have been sending letters all over 
the United States with the following 
content: 

“A few weeks ago THE CRISIS pub- 
lished a symposium on. ‘Inter-Mar- 
riage’. It was instructive. 

“Our economic condition is such at 
present as to threaten our foundation. 
We need jobs to live and training to 
hold jobs. 

‘“‘We most earnestly request the di- 
rectors of THe Crisis to publish a 
symposium on ‘How to Get Jobs and 
Keep Them’. It is thought that much 
good may come from an inter-change 
of ideas on such a topic at this time.” 

We know this perfectly well; but 
we published the inter-marriage sym- 
posium because the white people of the 
United States are interested in noth- 
ing else. Inter-marriage is what they 
mean by the race problem, and any 
attempt on our part to evade the dis- 
cussion of it, is taken as indication and 
proof of our desire to settle the Negro 
problem by race suicide. Therefore, 
we have done our duty by our white 
friends. - 

All the more willingly now we turn 
to a question which we have contin- 
ually discussed—the economic eman- 
cipation of the American Negro; and 
we will put it in the frank form sug- 
gested: 

We want letters on the subject: 
“How I got a job and kept it,” or 
“How I got a job and why I lost it.” 
The letters must be, Ist: short; 2nd: 
they must tell actual experiences, with- 
out comment or moralizing; that is, 


210 


we want the writer to tell how he got 
a job, instead of advising other people 
how to get jobs; 3rd: the writer must 
send his name and address, but this 
will not be published unless he so de- 
sires; 4th: we want the details to be 
exact: the kind of job obtained, the 
exact nature of the work, the wages 
received, the hours of work, the diffi- 
culty of keeping the job; and in case 
the job was lost, why it was lost. 


We shall not publish all the letters 
received. That would be physically 
impossible. But we shall publish a 
judicious and interesting selection. 


CLASSES AMONG NEGROES 
E FRANKLIN FRAZIER of 


Fisk University has an article 
in the American Journal of Sociology, 
for March, on “Occupational Classes 
Among Negroes in Cities”. The fol- 
lowing is an abstract: 

“Although from the time of their in- 
troduction into America individual Ne- 
groes have escaped from the economic 
status of the masses, and during slavery 
a part of the free colored population in 
cities constituted a distinct class because 
of their economic and cultural develop- 
ment, the most significant differentiation 
of the population into ccupational classes 
has occurred since the Civil War. In 
urban centers, where the differentiation 
has chiefly taken place, differences were 
observable in the percentage distribution 
of occupational classes for selected noth- 
ern, southern, and border cities for 
1920. The northern cities where large 
communities have grown up since the 
World War showed on the whole a 
greater differentiation of the population. 
In the case of Chicago it was possible 
to study the distribution of the occupa- 
tional classes within the Negro com- 
munity. The distribution of these 
classes as well as  home-ownership 
tended to conform to Dr. Burgess’ 
gradients for determining the growth of 
the city. The lower occupational groups 
tend to concentrate in the transition 
area of the city and along the railroad 
tracks. The movement of the higher 
occupational classes out from the mass 
of the Negro population is similar to 
the tendency of the more prosperous 
immigrants to move into areas of sec- 
ond and third settlement. This tendency 
among Negroes is held in check by the 
fact of color. A field study of an-area 
with a large concentration of the upper 
occupational classes revealed the efforts 
of these classes to escape from the areas 
occupied by the lower economic groups 
in order to maintain their own stand- 
ards of behavior.” 


Nothing illustrates more clearly the 
way in which outside pressure and a 
lack of social control within the race 
compels a class structure among Ne- 
groes which tend to copy that among 
the whites. If social class among whites 
had been successful in solving social 


problems, we could rest content: but 
they have been notoriously and Sea 
trously unsuccessful. It is Zoing to 
take, therefore, on the part of intellj- 
gent Negroes, some hard thinking and 
swift action to keep from repeating 
within the race the subjection of the 
working masses, which is the rule of 
European civilization. 


EURASIA 


OST American Negroes know 
fA nothing of Eurasia. They are 
quite ignorant of the fact that there 
are in various parts of Asia, and par- 
ticularly in India and Burma, 1,300. 
000 mulattoes who are descendants of 
whites and Asiatics. They have faced 
the same kind of problems as Negro- 
white mulattoes in America. Their 
physical and mental ability has been 
decried and systematically lied about. 
They have been kicked down by the 
white folk and kicked out by brown 
people. They have had great diff- 
culty in achieving any inner unity, and 
have continually faced the disintegra- 
tion in their own ranks which made 
Eurasian men think of themselves as 
European rather than Asiatic, and let 
Eurasian women choose concubinage to 
cheap white men rather than marriage 
to Asiatics. 

With all this, we can sympathize 
only too well. We have been through 
it all, and we have conquered, and the 
Eurasians are going to conquer. They 
are today meeting and refuting the lies 
told about them; they are giving up 
lamentations over their Asiatic blood; 
they are producing poets and reform- 
ers like Derozio; heroes like Skinner; 
women like Kitty Kirkpatrick and 
Alice Gomez, the great Eurasian 
singer. : 

They can point, as we can, to many 
distinguished white families, who say 
nothing of their colored blood. They 
have left behind the usual argument as 
to name, whether they should be called 
“European” or “Anglo-Indian” or 
“Eurasian”. At last the turning point 
has come. They are centering upon 
education and leadership; upon eco- 
nomic and political emancipation, and 
upon communal co-operation. They 
are raising money for investigation. 
Thus, in British India and in the 
Malay Islands, rises this new and in- 
teresting race problem, together with 
the men who are determined to solve 
it. 

American Negroes who are inter- 
ested should read “The Eurasian Prob- 
lem” by Kenneth E. Wallace; “Cim- 
merii”’, by Cedric Dover ; “Hostages t 
India” by Herbert A. Stark; “Henry 
Derozio” by Cedric Dover; and pet 
iodicals like the Anglo-Indian Citizen 
and the Anglo-Indian Review.

Africa 
(Continued from page 195) 
them is meaningless and purposeless. 

Next, an effort must soon be made 
to begin work in the rural districts. 
For, after all, the masses of the people 
are still in these sections and it is a 
dreary life too. As we ride through 
these sections we always feel the lone- 
liness of it. Sometimes one sees no 
sign of human life—bare huts—not a 
shrub or bush, a few straggly chickens, 
and nothing else. The people are in- 
side the huts with nothing to do. This 
kind of life for bright, vigorous youth 
is sad and monotonous. 

With my mind’s eye I can see all 
these types of work going on during 
the next twenty-five years. In this 
transitional period of Africa from the 
old to the new life the Young Men’s 
Christian Associations have a wonder- 
ful opportunity to help a great race in 
the making. As Dr. Mott said to the 
Student Federation: ‘‘Now is the time 
to get into Africa on the ground floor”. 
If we lose this opportunity, it may not 
come again. 

I have a mental picture of the needs 
which are tremendous. A great race 
with a heritage lost; its foundations of 
life swept away; left empty of soul, 
impoverished, bewildered, confused. 
On the other hand, a Christian student 
group inspired, ready to consecrate 
their lives to their people, just waiting 
to be trained and used. Again a non- 
student city group steeped in ignor- 
ance and poverty living an aimless life. 
Then the country youth full of life 
and vigor, yet living an idle, dreary 
life. And yet these are people, human 
beings, living in a great age, moved 
and controlled by great forces. 

Again there is another picture—I 
speak in a detached way—A'‘man with 
a vision; unable to sleep because of 
that vision; a man on the field well 
prepared because of his long experience, 
and by reason of his great love for 
Africa and yet bound fast by inhibi- 
tions which can be easily removed. I 
hear him crying out, a long voice in 
the wilderness, not only for financial 
aid, but for a man, yea, men to help 
him. During the great war, that same 
voice cried out for help in East Africa 
and three men answered the call. Then 
peril lurked on land and sea and yet 
these men volunteered for Y. M. C. A. 
work. Two gave their lives for Africa 
and only one returned to tell the story.

Today in times of peace and pros- 
perity When a trip to South Africa is 
often taken for pleasure, not one has 
offered to go. Dear friends, can we 
jet this man bear the burden alone! 
Although he is still young enough to 
we his visions materialize if inhibitions 
are removed, yet time flies, youth pass- 
es, life departs. Soon this cry in the 
wilderness will cease, let us hear it 
while there is yet time. 

There is a town in South Africa. 
Through this town runs a river whose 
warm waters are saturated with min- 
erals good for the healing of divers 
diseases. From far and near people, 
Europeans only, come and bathe in 
this life-giving stream. One day as 
we visited this town and conversed 
with some of its voung people there 
was a bright-faced youth who im- 
pressed us very much. “Oh! Mr. 
Yergan,” said he, “I am so glad you 
have come at last. I have heard so 
much about you and the work you are 
doing. I have finished High School 
and am teaching and trying to study 
privately for my A.B. In a year or 
two I hope to have it. I wish you 
would come here and organize a Y. M. 
C. A.; it is much needed for we have 
nothing to do when our work is done; 
one gets so tired of just going down to 
see the river flow by”’. 

We left that town and came into an- 
other. That young man so saddened 
us that we told what he said to another 
group of young men with whom we 
talked. One said “Well, he can be 
glad that there is a river to watch; 
here in this town there is not even that. 
We have nothing to do”.

man wondered what kind of animal 
this was that could kick like a mule 
with his right arm and grin like an ape 
at the hardest blows. The battle raged 
in front of the cave, and Jerry crouched 
behind the vines. He hated a fight. 


Bill was giving ground now. One 
eye was partially closed, and he was 
bleeding profusely from the nose. His 
adversary realized this and was trying 
desperately for a knockout. He shot 
a wicked left to Bill’s chin that sent 
him reeling and groggy, but the Ger- 
man slipped on the treacherous gravel 
i front of the cave. He went down 
on one knee almost under the stone on 
which Jerry was sitting behind the 
vines, 

Private Jerry Walker was suddenly 
zed with a mad frenzy to end this 
disgusting fight. Quick as a flash he 
thrust his arm through the vines and 
came down with all his force upon the

The Gilpin Players 


(Continued from page 192) 
Travis, Cleveland artist, who has made 
fascinating studies on African subjects. 
When they learned that he was going 
to Africa, the Gilpins determined to 
use some of the money they had earned 
to contribute African ethnological and 
art objects to the Cleveland Museum 
of Natural History and the Cleveland 
Museum of Art. 

To this end, another group, inter- 
ested in the work the Gilpins were 
doing, was formed, calling themselves 
the African Art Sponsors, and the two 
groups gave $1,500.00 to Mr. Travis, 
which he used to purchase the African 
specimens that are now on exhibition 
at both museums. 

In the fall of 1927, the purchases 
of African art and ethnological ob- 
jects having been paid for, the Gilpins 
decided to raise money for a scholar- 
ship fund for Negro art students. So 
the Gilpin Players Scholarship Fund 
was started. 

It is a $5,000.00 scholarship that is 
handled entirely by the Cleveland Mu- 
seum of Art, to be used as they see 
fit, to provide a course at the Cleve- 
land School of Art for talented Negro 
art students. Sums of money are 
voted out to the Scholarship Fund by

- CRISIS 


Round Table Talks—Twentieth Year Program 


In November, 1910, the CRISIS began. With this issue we 
start the second half of the 20th year which we hope to finish 
with a larger circulation and a bigger and better magazine. 
This will be possible only through the co-operation of writers, 
advertisers, agents, subscribers and buyers 


AM a “shut in”. I have been sick 

and unable to walk for five years. I 
am now getting better and hope to con- 
tinue. I do not use my crutches very 
well yet, but as I get stronger, I hope 
to do better. 

I would be very much grieved not 
to have THE Crisis, I enjoy it very 
much and I would be glad to send it to 
others, but can not earn any money. If 
I were able to walk, I would work for 
new subscribers. 

Mrs. Nettie S. Turner, Arkansas. 


HAVE been a constant reader of THE 
Crisis since 1912. There is nothing 
just like it in reading matter that comes 
to me. I like the stand that it takes in 
defense of the rights of colored people. 
A. S. Hoard, Virginia. 


WISH to thank you for calling my 


attention to the advantages of ad- 
vertising in THE Crisis, and enclosing 
rates. No one knows the advantages of 
such advertising better than I, and it is 
one of my deep regrets that I do not see 
my way clear at present to take advan- 
tage of your proposition. Our income 
this year has been far below our expec- 
tations and we have been forced to 
eliminate a number of very desirable 
and even necessary activities. It has 
been difficult so far just to keep our 
heads above the water. I am hoping 
that by another year the situation here 
will be somewhat relieved, and if so, we 
shall be glad to take up your proposi- 


North Carolina. 


UST a line to say that I admire you 

more and more as the days go by. 

1 wonder what the people will do when 

you are here no more. I say the people 

for I shall also be where you are when 
you go. 

There are very few men who have the 
guts to say and do what you do. I 
honor and respect you eternally. I am 
recalling the Haitian affair. 

Georgia Douglas Johnson, 
District of Columbia. 


LMOST daily the mail brings me 

favorable “echoes” from the De- 
cember issue of THE Crisis. I am con- 
vinced that you have the ears of the 
thoughtful readers who are concerned 
about an economic program for the Ne- 
gro. Enclosed is a copy of a letter from 
the Socialist Party of America. 

I anxiously await the reaction of the 
thinking public on the final installment 
of the essay and trust that our fond 
ropes may materialize into something 
very definite in the near future. 

W. C. Matney, West Virginia. 


AST year the State legislature of 

North Carolina refused to appro- 
priate any money for advertising State 
institutions of all kinds. For that rea- 
son, we found it necessary to withdraw 
our advertising from your magazine. 
We realize the fine results that our ad 
in your periodical brought and as soon as 
it is possible, we shall be very glad to re- 
sume regular advertisement with you. 


AM very much pleased with THE 
Crisis and the great wosk it is go- 
ing for the Race. 
Olivia V. Tolbert, Arkansas.

M sorry to be so late in renewing 
my subscription. Just did not 
have the money. I received the Janu- 
ary number. Could you send February 
and March numbers together? It is a 
wonderful magazine. I believe in it 
and also get a kick out of reading it. 
I’m white as to skin—and try to be 
otherwise, but because I treat the col- 
ored in my office just as the white and 
sometimes better (because they deserve 
it and are whiter than some of the 
whites), they who are so narrow and 
bigoted throw mud on me. But I do 
not care for I would not be so narrow 
and bigoted as they are. I’m in the 
United States Bureau. 


OD bless you and your co-workers 

to keep well and prosperous, many, 
very many years to continue the publi- 
cation of THE Crisis. We regard it as 
the best magazine for us to read and 
the best edited magazine of its kind 
anywhere. We love to read its pages 
because we get strength to hope on for 
more earnest endeavor in the general 
uplift of humanity. 
Mrs. L. S. Seabrook, North Carolina. 


HAVE been reading THe Crisis for 

about two years and I hardly think 

I could get along without it. I guess 

I will read it the rest of my life and in 
the next world, if they have it. 

New Eastern State Penitentiary, Penn. 


E reason I did not send in prompt 

renewal. I have been waiting to 
secure new subscribers for your great 
magazine as I have always done for the 
last twelve or fifteen years. 

William M. Jordan, Sr., Georgia.
