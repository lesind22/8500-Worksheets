E Southern Aid Society of Virginia, Inc. developed a 
$200.00 Industrial Debit in the Newark, N. J. area during 
the winter months, also an agency staff of six representa- 
tives, without employing or in any way interfering with 
the representatives of other companies. 


These accomplishments demonstrate again the attractive 
and protective value of this company’s Superior Policy Con- 
tract, and the practice of clean methods and fair play in 
building agency staffs.

ALL YOUR LIFE 


INCE Adam was turned out of Eden, the 
human race has earned its bread by the 
sweat of its brow. But some of the sons 
and daughters of Adam have been wise enough 
to insure themselves a resting time in the eve- 
ning of life. The heat and toil of the long day 
over, they can recline in the shadow of their 
“vines and fig trees” and take their ease. 





That is what we all look forward to. No 
one wants to work all his life. Nor is it pleas- 
ant to be dependent upon others when old age 
begins to tell. 


You can provide for a dignified and as- 
sured old age. You can arrange to enjoy 
golden days of leisure in the evening of 
life. The Seven-Point Anniversary Policy 
of this Company, the liberal provisions of 
which were devised in celebration of our 
Thirtieth Anniversary, includes an endow- 
ment feature among its seven points of 
advantage. 
























Write your name, and address, and age at 
nearest birthday, on a postal card if you wish, 
and mai] it to the Home Office, Washington, 
D. C. Full particulars of the Anniversary 
Policy, or any other form of policy which may 
interest you, will then be sent you without 
obligation.

ING ARTHUR, who runs a 

Round Table, whenever he finds 
a stray Knight to knock in the head, 
waved his sceptre at me thoughtfully 
the other night and discoursed like this 
—“I don’t get the raison d’etre of the 
Crow. Now, if it is meant for sophis- 
ticated people and highbrows and folks 
with Ph.D.’s and that cattle, then what 
does it say that they do not already 
know? And if it is meant for the 
masses, how in tophet are they to know 
what it is all about ?”—I was calm and 
stern and accepted a light from his fif- 
teenth sceptre and replied—The Crow 
is designed for sophisticated people who 
can read and write and who know 
what happened if 1066, 1492 and in 
1863. The Crow is not interested in 
fools and illiterates.—It fixes its calm 
gaze upon the Truth and particularly 
upon the unpleasant truth. It is cyni- 
cal, sarcastic, mean and low. It leaves 
sugar, molasses, and optimism to those 
who know by personal experience that 
God’s in his Heaven.—The Crow con- 
centrates its attention mainly on Hell. 
It remarks, for instance, that the an- 
niversary of David Livingston, a great 
and good missionary, has just been cele- 
brated; and it does not fail to remem-

sionary was the foundation stone upon 
which the modern theft and rape of 
Africa has taken place—The Crow 
heard with paroxisms of joy that the 
International Paper Trust and Super- 
power are buying up the nation’s news- 
papers. Let’s have the ownership of 
thought in the United States clear and 
open.—And about this teaching of peo- 
ple who know it all and have learned 
everything and are sophisticated be- 
yond others. Even these gentry the 
Crow looks straight in the eye and pro- 
poses to interpret the world to them 
in terms of Color. They may twist 
and turn but the Crow caws.—They 
know it all but they do not know the 
color interpretation of it—DLaw en- 
forcement in the United States, sacred 
for liquor, unimportant for Niggers.— 
Literature and art in Harlem deals 
with black prostitutes and white 
churches—And the Tariff! The 
tariff is a tax mainly on colored labor 
for the support of white millionaires. 
It is consequently the foundation stone

of American Democracy.—After hav- 
ing fastened the graft of Chicago and 
Mississippi on Negroes, the juries and 
prosecutors got cold feet. The Crow 
knows who stole the money. Send him 
a stamped envelope.—And by and by, 
since Perry Howard has been tried 
twice and aequitted and faces a third 
trial for grafting, why not let . him 
stand trial permanently for all the 
money stolen by white Republicans 
from Mark Hanna to Albert Fall ?— 
This would enable the White House 
to look sanctimonious and the reform 
of the Solid South could proceed 
apace.—Who killed the Cock-Robin of 
Peace and Disarmament? I, said the 
United States of America. because I 
insist on making Europe pay a debt I 
don’t need for a war which I helped 
start and which made me, because of 
the misery and murder of my fellow 
men, the most prosperous and happy 
nation on earth.—We are now engaged 
in rescuing the American farmer by 
patting him gently on the back and 
kicking him firmly in the pants.— 
There is a world fair at Seville and

“The Financial Stage of America” 
Prize Cartoon by Cornelius W. Johnson, 
(Page 197). 


THE Crisis 











HAVE been very much occupied 
| with the completion for publication 
of an enlarged edition of my book on 
“White Capital and Coloured La- 
bour,” first published about 24 years 
ago; it has taken up all the time I 
could spare from other current Parlia- 
mentary work and writing, much of 
which has been rather specially devoted 
to such contribution as I am able to 
make to the purposes for which your 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Coloured People exists. Re- 
sponsibility for keeping that department 
of the work of the Labour Party in 
view tends to impose itself upon me, 
for the mere reason that having given 
more study to it than most people, I 
am sensitive to and am able to invite 
publicity to tendencies and acts of pol- 
icy inspired by reactionary incentives, 
and put in a word wherever I can find 
an opening. 


I feel hardly capable of putting into 
a paragraph for your American read- 
ers what I might be disposed to say 
in appreciation of your cause; and, in 
fact, I always feel a distaste for as- 
suming towards my fellow men of 
African race the somewhat patronizing 
attitude of telling them that I do not 
think they are really so black as our 
negrophobists paint them. I would as 
soon address Frenchmen or Germans in 
a like strain. 


I am, therefore, sending you a copy 
of my book, which I hope you will ac- 
cept as an expression of my sincere re- 
gard and admiration for yourself. In 





World Problems of Race 


By LORD OLIVIER 


Lord Olivier, better known as 
Sir Sidney Olivier, was a member 
of the Cabinet of the British La- 


bor Government. For many years 


he was Governor of Jamaica, and 
while there wrote the epoch-making 
book “White Capital and Coloured 
Labour”. 


In 1927, he published 
“The Anatomy of African Mis- 
ery’, a study of the race problems 
in South Africa. This year, he has 
issued a new and enlarged edition 
of his first book. He is one of the 
few great statesmen of Europe 
who knows and appreciates the 
gravity of the color problems. 





it you will find what I, as a European, 
writing for Europeans, have expressed 
as well as I can of what I feel with 
regard to the position and rights of 
coloured races. It may displease you 
in some respects, owing to insufficient 
insight, and in some parts it will strike 
you as exceedingly incomplete,, for I 


have not devoted myself to bringing up ° 


to date in any adequate manner the ob- 
servations I made 25 years ago about 
the United States: though I have, in 
fact, given a good deal of attention to 
later developments, which seem to me 
extremely encouraging and satisfactory. 
Such books as Alain Locke’s ‘““The New 
Negro” are most gratifying evidence 
of the progress of Negro racials in 
emancipation from the fatal repression 
of the inferiority complex. 






If, therefore, you would like to have 
any words of mine in co-operation with 
the purposes of your movement, I think 
that would best be affected if, after 
reading my book, you would say quite . 
critically in your paper what you think 
of it in that aspect ; and, if you think it 
useful, would do your best to promote 
inquiry for it among readers in the 
United States. Get your Book Clubs 
to adopt it as their “book of the 
month.” 


You will recognize that I have 
thought it most important to call at- 
tention (as I did in my last previous 
book, “the Anatomy of African Mis- 
ery’), to the menace to the world in- 
volved in the European exploiting pol- 
icy in Africa, and especially to the 
central focus of danger which is de- 
veloping in South Africa. General 
Hertzog’s South African policy is at the 
present moment the spear-point of this 
attack. Fortunately, there is a strong 
counter-current running in South Af- 
rica itself against the principles of this 
policy, and in that counter-current the 
majority of intelligent Europeans in 
South Africa are in happy association 
with the small body of educated and 
civilized natives, some of whom are of 
very fine types of human intelligence 
and character. 


In short, all the acceptable represen- 
tatives of “European” civilization 
there are standing up in opposition to 
the idea that the maintenance of Euro- 
pean civilization depends upon the re- 
pression of Africans. 


The New Academic Building, Fort Valley School, Ga., Page 191. 


June, 1929 





This is the story of a Negro 
school in south Georgia which is 


today celebrating a quarter cen- 
tury of work. 





6¢6¥ KNOWED all this when it 

wasn’t nothing but pasture land.” 
Joe Perry, farmer, housemover and 
philosopher swung his arm in an elo- 
quent arc, and in its compass he in- 
cluded the ninety acre campus of the 
Ft. Valley High and Industrial School ; 
he encircled the principal’s home, the 
pillared entrance gate, the Carnegie 
Library, Jeanes Hall, Huntington 
Hall, the Royal C. Peabody Trades 
Building, the new $100,000 Academic 
Building, the new Model Training 
School, the Domestic Science building, 
the farm, the barns, cows, pigs, chick- 
ens and a myriad other components of 
a busy, purposeful community. 

“We've seen it grow stone on stone 
these twenty-five years an’ we loves it, 
sir, we loves every bit of it.”” And his 
laughing eyes twinkled as he watched 
the busy workers fast finishing the walls 
of Ohio Hall, the boy’s new dormitory. 

I soon found out that Joe speaks for 
a whole community. He and his asso- 
ciates have seen the Ft. Valley School 
grow from an old lodge hall into a mod- 
ern, efficient institution ; they have seen 
not only the education of young black 
men and women but the metamorphosis 
of the life of an entire countryside. 
They look upon the school with its 
buildings as the true focal point of 
their community life; they come to the 
principal for counsel and advice, the 
housewives bring their trials to Mrs. 
Hunt’s door, the school’s auditorium is 
their recreational center and during 
this year with its agricultural depres- 
sion and bank failures, the school has 
indeed proved their “Rock in a weary 
land.” 

Twenty-five years—a quarter of a 
century—Mr. and Mrs. Hunt have 
labored here, hand in hand, teaching 
the art and science of living to a people 
who so sorely needed them. They have 
builded here an institution, strong, hon- 
est, real and pleasant to look upon. 
However, their greatest contribution 
consists in the buoyant effect of the 
school upon the surrounding com- 
munity, spreading the ideals of educa- 
tion, health, industrial training, farm 
and home demonstration work, super- 
vision of county schools and decent rec- 
reation. The school is leavening the

THE Crisis 















N the original version of Krenek’s 
| “Jonny Spielt Auf”, as produced at 
Leipzig, Vienna, Paris and other cen- 
ters of artistic endeavor, the story is as 
follows: 

Max, a dreamy idealistic composer, 
meets Anita, an opera singer, who is 
lost on a glacier, and leads her back to 
her hotel. TYhey become lovers. Anita 
soon leaves for Paris to create the title- 
role in one of Max’s operas. In the 
corridor of a Paris hotel, where Anita 
is staying, Jonny makes his first ap- 
pearance. He is described as “Der 
Neger Jonny, Jazzband Geiger (The 
Negro Jonny, Jazz-band Violinist)”. 
Jonny tells Yvonne, a chambermaid 
who is in love with him, that he must 
get hold of a famous violin owned by 
Daniello, a celebrated concert virtuoso, 
because the beauty of its tone drives 
him wild every time he hears it. While 
Jonny is standing there, Daniello 
emerges from his room, locking the 
door behind him, and Anita enters and 
sits down to write a letter. Jonny is 
struck dumb by her beauty. He says 
he feels as though he has never seen a 
woman before. He approaches her and 
tells her that he loves her. He begs 
her to allow him to show his love for 
just one night. He says he knows well 
how white women are in such matters, 
but he promises to disappear in the 
morning, and she will not see him 
again. 

Anita admits an “urge of the blood” 
in response to Jonny’s proposal, but 
Daniello senses the situation, and se- 
cretly passes Jonny a thousand-franc 
note with the demand that he disap- 
pear. Daniello then proceeds to press 
the same proposal in a more polished 
form. The diva feels that she cannot 
resist and they disappear into her room. 


Jonny enters with a master key, 
opens Daniello’s room and steals the 
precious violin. He comes back and 
removes Anita’s banjo from its case 
(she had placed it beside the writing 
table while she wrote) and_ sub- 
stitutes the violin. In the morning, 
Anita appears, ready to leave Paris 
and return to Max. Daniello begs 
her to stay longer, but she tells 
him she really “belongs to another”. 
Daniello goes to his room to play 
her a farewell air on his violin, 
and discovers its loss. He calls the 
police, makes a scene and Yvonne is 
discharged, but she is immediately en- 
gaged by Anita. The scorned virtuoso 
revenges himself by giving Yvonne the

Jonny Tunes Up 


By HARRY S. KEELAN 


In the season of the Metro- 
politan Opera just closed in New 
York City, an innovation was 
Ernst Krenek’s opera “Jonny 
Spielt Auf’. This use of an 
opera with a Negro hero led to 


such extraordinary subterfuges 
and excuses that it is worthwhile 
to tell at last the whole story as 
a commentary on American color 
prejudice. 


ring Anita had given him, with injunc- 
tions to give it to Max with Daniello’s 
greetings. Anita starts out of the door, 
when Jonny reminds her that she is 
forgetting her banjo. She picks up the 
banjo-case, containing the violin, and 
departs. 

Max is sentimentalizing in Anita’s 
flower-filled room awaiting her return. 
Anita appears, and soon afterwards 
Yvonne delivers the ring to Max, who 


leaves in a rage as he recognizes it. 


Jonny, who has followed the stolen vio- 
lin, comes in the window, discovers 
Yvonne alone in the room and, after 
surprised greetings, gets Yvonne to 
bring him the banjo case. He extracts 
the violin therefrom, leaps in his joy 
on top of the piano, and sings the most 
wonderful aria of the opera. He sings 
that now that the violin is his, he will 
play upon it as David of old played 
upon the harp, and will praise Jehovah, 
who created men black; that to him 
belongs everything good in the world, 
all the good that the Old World has 
produced but does not know what else 
to do with it; therefore the New 
World journeys across from over the 
sea in splendor, and takes over the heri- 
tage of Old Europe by means of the 
dance. He leaps out of the window 
and is gone with the violin. 


Max is next seen seeking consolation 
from his beloved glacier which advises 
him to return to life and make the best 
of it. A radio loud-speaker from a 
nearby Alpine hotel now project’s 
Jonny’s Jazz-band music and Daniello, 
among the guests, recognizes the tones 
of his stolen violin and telegraphs the 
police. Jonny appears at the railroad 
terminal where three policemen are 
searching for him. Max enters to meet 
Anita and go to America with her, 
where she has a contract to fulfill. 
Jonny, hard-pressed, drops the stolen 
violin on Max’s baggage. The police 


discover it there, arrest Max, and go 
off with him and the violin. Daniello 
has witnessed the incident with sur- 
prised. joy. Anita appears and begs 
Daniello to go to the police and tell 
them that Max is not the thief, but he 
refuses. In a scuffle, in which he is 
trying to prevent Anita from going 
herself, Yvonne gives him a push, and 
he falls to the track before the oncom- 
ing locomotive, and is instantly killed. 

Jonny appears in front of the police 
station, knocks the waiting chauffeur 
unconscious, abducts Max, the two 
policemen accompanying him, (whom 
he later throws out), and the violin. 
Max appears at the terminal just as the 
train is about to leave, and the waiting 
party gives vent to joyous “Ah’s”. 
Jonny appears above the railroad 
clock and utters a triumphant “Ah!” 
as he waves his violin aloft. He leaps 
for the train, misses it, and lands on 
the clock, which has turned into a re- 
volving world, with Jonny sitting on 
top, ecstatically playing his violin. Be- 
low, all the world is joyfully dancing 
to his music. The same theme is re- 
peated about praising Jehovah for cre- 
ating men black, and the New World 
inheriting the old through the dance. 
Jonny tunes up! 


The opera was composed in 1925-26, 
and was first performed in Leipzig, 
February 11, 1927. Afterward, it was 
repeated with great success in over 
sixty European opera houses. America 
heard of it and made some interesting 
comments : 


In the Christian Science Monitor of 
March 19, 1927, just after the original 
production of the opera at Leipzig, 
Adolph Weissman wrote as follows: 
“Jonny is playing. Jonny is the king 
of players, a great violinist of the jazz- 
band, but at the same time one of the 
sliest Negroes ever known, for he steals 
the virtuoso’s violin.” No other men- 
tion is made of the story, though there 
is high praise for the music. In the 
Musical Courier of March 10, 1927, 
Adolph Aber says that it is the story 
of five depraved characters of which 
the Negro is the most depraved of all. 
“Jonny approaches Anita with an in- 
sulting proposition,” he wrote, “Daniel- 
lo comes in and buys Jonny off with a 
thousand-franc note.” Then Anita 
goes to bed with Daniello. . How de- 
praved Jonny is! In the New York 
Tribune of October 2, 1927, appears

i 


ON TO CLEVELAND 
NE of the most notable anniver- 
O sary meetings ever held by colored 
and white people jointly in America, is 
scheduled to take place in Cleveland, 
Ohio, from June 26 to July 2. 

It is a meeting that the entire city of 
Cleveland is preparing for on a lavish 
scale, that will attract visitors from all 
parts of the United States, and that 
should attract attention the world over. 

For, in the first place, it is the 
Twentieth Anniversary Conference of 
the National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People, the old- 
est body since the Civil War, defend- 
ing the citizenship status of the Ameri- 
can Negro. A record of accomplish- 
ment has been rounded out that has 
been of inestimable importance not to 
the Negro alone, but to other minority 
groups in America, for whose funda- 
mental rights the Negro and his cause 
have served as “shock troops.” The 
accomplishments during twenty years 
by the N. A. A. C. P., beyond this, 
have been an essential and integral 
contribution to the American nation. 

This will be brought out in Cleve- 
land. It will be recognized and stressed 
there, that a new era of hope has be- 
gun. The recognition will come in the 
form of most unusual celebrations. 

First of all, the main Sunday mass 
meeting of the N. A. A. C. P. Twen- 
tieth Anniversary Conference, on June 
30, is to be held in an auditorium seat- 
ing 15,000 people, and the probability 
is that this auditorium will be filled. 
This is the same place in which the Re- 
publican National Convention was held 
in 1924, and there is nothing inappro- 
priate in a meeting of the N. A. A. 
C. P., an organization standing for the 
rights of 12,000,000 citizens, in a hall 
where a major political party of the 
United States convened. 

Furthermore the City of Cleveland 
and its public institutions are planning 
to cooperate in a most unprecedented 
way in celebrating the occasion. Ac- 
cording to present plans, the N. A. A. 
C. P. Twentieth Anniversary Con- 
ference is to be the guest of the Cleve- 
land Museum of Art on Saturday, 
June 29th, and at that time there will 
be on display a special exhibition of 
Negro art. This exhibit is to remain 
on view during the entire conference 
week and is to be accompanied by ad- 
dresses on Negro art and literature. 

In addition to this the Cleveland 
Museum of Natural History is plan-

THE N.A.A.CP. BATTLE FRONT 





ning a special exhibit of African Eth- 
nology. This will include exhibits of 
the various races inhabiting the African 
continent, their work and crafts, weav- 
ng, carving, and other folk expressions, 
as well as musical instruments, iron and 
metal work. 

Not content with enlisting these two 
Museums of the City of Cleveland, 
the Conference Committee, under the 
chairmanship of Harry E. Davis, who 
is Civil Service Commissioner of Cleve- 
land as well as a member of the Board 
of Directors of the N. A. A. C. P., has 
made the Cleveland Public Library a 
part of the occasion. During the Con- 
ference, at the Library, there will be 
held a display of books by Negro au- 
thors and literature on the subject of 
race relations. 


UT that does not exhaust the truly 

unusual program arranged for this 
20th Anniversary meeting of the N. A. 
A. C. P. The able Conference Com- 
mittee have planned a still more un- 
usual feature for the closing night of 
the Conference, Tuesday night, July 
2. This is the night on which the 
Spingarn Medal is to be presented. On 
that night, instead of the usual musi- 
cal program preceding the meeting, ar- 
rangements have been made for the 
Gilpin Players to present a one-act 
play, “No Account Boy”. This meet- 
ing is to be held in the Music Hall 
of the Public Auditorium, whose deco- 
rations and appointments are in keep- 
ing with the dignity and grace that al- 
ways surround the presentation of the 
Spingarn Medal. 

Mr. Davis, the Conference Commit- 
tee chairman, writes of the Gilpin 
Players, that they “are a_ talented 
group of local players interested in 
dramatics. They are now under the 
direction of Rowena Woodham Jelliffe 
and are rapidly gaining national reputa- 
tion for their splendid presentations. 

“Among the local musical organiza- 
tions which will participate in the Con- 
ference are the King Quartette, the 
Treble Clef Club, the Maxwell Quar- 
tette, and the Mozart Glee Club. The 
Maxwell Quartette recently won first 
prize in a city-wide contest sponsored 
by the Cleveland News. 

“The ladies of the Entertainment 
Committee are arranging for a Satur- 
day afternoon tea for the entertainment 
of lady delegates and visitors, and on 
Saturday night a reception and dance 
will be held in the ball-room of the 


wh 


Auditorium.” 


All these features of the Twentieth 
Anniversary Conference of the N. A. 
A. C. P. in Cleveland are cited, not 
because they are the main reason for 
attending it. But they will go far to- 
ward making the Conference a pleas- 
ant as well as instructive experience. 

The main function of this week’s 
meeting in Cleveland, as of other an- 
nual spring conferences of the N. A. 
A. C. P. is to bring together from all 
parts of the country those who are in- 
terested in dealing directly and intelli- 
gently with the problems arising out of 
the contacts of white and colored 
Americans. 

At the night sessions the delegates 
and visitors are privileged to listen to 
men and women prominent in the na- 
tional life who have given their best 
thought to these problems. They have 
heard in the past mayors and state gov- 
ernors, presidents of leading univer- 
sities, writers, musicians, business men, 
lawyers, legislators, judges,’ social 
workers, educators and journalists. 

At the day sessions, where the dele- 
gates are given opportunity to speak 
and to report on their activities and dis- 
coveries, visitors have the opportunity 
to learn how inter-racial relations are 
dealt with in many parts of the coun- 
try. And in the frank discussions that 
take place new and interesting possi- 
bilities are brought in view. 


O that beneath the round of enter- 
tainment, of- good fellowship, and 
the opportunity to meet in person once 
a year, friends from distant parts, a 
serious and important work is going on. 
The people most directly concerned are 
taking counsel together how best to 
strengthen and push forward the work 
for which the N. A. A. C. P. was or- 
ganized and which it has carried on tri- 
umphantly for twenty years. Those 
who have come to annual spring con- 
ferences of the N. A. A. C. P. have 
testified to the new faith and encour- 
agement they have derived from 
these encounters and discussions, The 
branches have often found that the 
presence of so distinguished a gathering 
in their city has made a profound dif- 
ference in the attitude of white toward 
colored citizens. 

But beyond even. this, the annual 
conference of the N. A. A. C. P. has 
been a sort of national forum of in- 
formation on the latest developments

THE Crisis 






} 





Countée Cullen on French Courtesy 


Paris, March 1, 1929. 


NE may reasonably be expected 

after a six months’ sojourn in a 
strange land to arrive at some definite 
opinion of the people. All the labels 
and tags should by this time be sifted 
and assorted. I recall that it has taken 
singularly less time for many visitors 
to America to arrive at the most defi- 
nite and erroneous conclusions about 
us, and that many white excursionists 
on a rapid and casual visit to Negro 
quarters have satisfactorily, to their 
thinking, pigeonholed the entire race, 
with astonishing celerity, if with dubi- 
ous acuteness. After all, the tendency 
to generalize is so inately human that 
it should be pardoned. Moreover, the 
truth of any matter is an elusive and 
many colored thing. Therefore, it is 
with little faith in my own observa- 
tions that after my half year’s stay 
among them, walking their streets, 
talking to them when I could do so 
without seeming offensively inquisitive, 
that I find myself thinking of the 
French as a people of consummate 
politeness, of a most enlightened tol- 
erance, and of a sad impecunity. 

The manners of the French are 
amazing, and must occasion foreigners, 
especially the younger element of 
Americans and the suddenly and vul- 
garly well-to-do, many moments of 
acute embarrassment. For it has never 
seemed to me that politeness has played 
a large part in American living. It is 
true that Southerners, both black and 
white, lay strenuous and oft repeated 
claims to an exclusive lien on_hos- 
pitality. But that is another matter. 
A politeness of the French variety 
cannot conceivably exist in a section of 
the country where one group despises 
the other and merely grudgingly tol- 
erates its continued existence. The 
American pace in general is too swift 
to allow the display of social solici- 
tudes that one thinks of in connection 
with politeness a la francaise. It is a 
brand that cannot thrive on hurry. 
There, probably, is the reason it has 
reached so genteel a growth among the 
French. Though Negroes are mythi- 
cally accredited with the world’s most 
comprehensive understanding of the 
importance of leisure, I doubt that even 
we can even slightly approach the Gal- 
lic appreciation of that blissful state. 
It seems that, for the French, tomor- 
row is a far more important time than 
either yesterday or today; for tomor- 
row may be done all that he put off 
doing yesterday, all that he will prob- 
ably delay doing today. He is very 


June, 1929 


like the schoolboy dallying with the 
lessons that he knows must eventually 
be learned, but only at the last mo- 
ment. 

“Sir” and “Madam” and “Ma’am” 
have long since disappeared from cur- 
rent American speech, unless there be 
parts of the country where they are 
held over as interesting relics of ante- 
bellum days. Nowadays one answers 
questions crisply with a short curt, 
hurried, “yes” or ‘“‘no”; trappings are 
obsolete; it is not even required that 
children be hampered with them in 
their relations with their parents or 
with their teachers. Perhaps such ex- 
pressions would have a false ring in a 
democratic country. I recall an inci- 
dent that occurred not so long ago in 
New York when, in a mood of singu- 
lar amiability and humility, I answered 
“ves, ma’am” to a question put to me 
by a lady. It was so much wasted 
abasement, for the lady informed me 
that in these enlightened times no one 
said “ma’am’’ any more, nor “sir.” 

Now that I think of it, a possible 
explanation occurs to me. At the time, 
the lady, though far on the shady side 
of life, was still a maiden, technically 
speaking. Since then she has managed 
to edge into the marital state, and may 
have changed her mind about those ob- 
solete expressions. After all, “Mad- 
am,” in her case, was truly inappro- 
priate, and may have smacked of a 
smirking levity on my part. But in 
France, it is the mark of the stranger, 
of the crude man from across the 
waters, not to employ these ancient im- 
pediment» of politeness. An excellent 
thesis, I am sure, one that would warm 
the hearts of the sovereign board of 
any of our American universities would 
be: “How Many Times Per Day Are 
‘Monsieur,’ ‘Madame,’ and ‘Mademoi- 
selle’ Used in French Conversation 
and What is the General Effect of 
Such Extravagance on the Morale of 
American Visitors ?” 

What purchaser in an American 
store has not at some time in his ex- 
perience had that guiltiest of feeling 
induced in him by the surliness of a 
storekeeper suddenly called from his 
newspaper, his lunch, or a choice bit 
of gossip, that he, the buyer, was ac- 
tually being favored far and away 
above his natural deserts in being al- 
lowed to make a purchase at that par- 
ticular moment? But whatever your 
purchase in a French store, be it a bit 
of bread that you must carry through 
the streets with no more hygienic cov- 
ering that your naked hand, a bottle of 
wine, or an automobile, your visit to 
the Frenchman’s shop has all the ear- 


marks of a social call. On entering, 
you are at once most solicitously bid 
good day; if it is your second visit to 
that particular store, your health is a 
subject of vital importance to the 
proprietor; and because your wife has 
not accompanied you this morning 
(having been with you yesterday) he. 
is breathless in his anxiety lest any fa- 
tality may have occurred to her dur- 
ing the night. And when you depart 
with your badly tied package of little 
things falling every way but right, 
your total expenditure having amounted 
to about twenty-four cents in Ameri- 
can currency, it is the sheerest ill breed- 
ing for you not only not to wish the 
proprietor good day, but to hope that, 
you will see him again. 

To one accustomed to the manners 
of passengers riding the Interborough 
Rapid Transit Lines, the politeness en- 
countered on the Paris subway, or 
Metropolitan, seems incredible. One 
does not kick, scratch, shunt, jostle, ‘or 
tickle the person in front of him out 
of his path as he nears the station 
where he desires to exit. But gently, 
suavely, softly, he begins in time to 
ask those in front of him if it is their 


- intention to descend at the next sta- 


tion. If such is not the case, they 
squeeze aside into themselves and al- 
low him to pass, until by a gradual 
process of elimination, the polite pas- 
senger finds himself at the door when 
the train glides into the station. Of 
course, this form of social considera- 
tion could not as easily be employed in 
the subways of New York, as the nat- 
ural temperament of the people would 
be against it. 

In some quarters I have heard French 
politeness explained away as having a 
commercial basis. I doubt seriously 
that this is so, that any commercial 
consideration could so change and 
modify. an entire people. It seems to 
me something innate, a natural in- 
herent streak, something fine and deli- 
cate, left over perhaps, as a French 
lady told me, from the days when 
France had kings and a court through 
whose vices shown the virtue of im- 
peccable manners. The lady, who is 
an arch royalist even now, decries what 
seem to me the most magnificent man- 
ners I have ever encountered. To her 
these are nothing, compared with the 
manners of those days that are gone 
forever (for even she has no hopes for 
the return of a royalist regime.) Not 
having smelled the flower in its dewy 
days, I can only say that if it be a bit 
wilted now, it still exhales a rare and 
charming savor.

Calendar Chat 
Where June comes in April 


STRANGE thing happened 
A here. It might have occurred 
almost anywhere for that matter. 
One afternoon a boy felt something 
drop on his head, then down to one 
shoulder and next in his pocket. The 
three landings were effected with 
amazing speed. And I imagine the 
boy began to think of jugglers and 
white doves and rabbits. He plunged 
one hand into the heavy pocket and 
found a flying squirrel, the first that 
I have seen in Montgomery, Alabama, 
where nature has all kinds of pleasant 
revelations for a northerner. 


Though but a day’s ride from Cin- 9 
June in j 


cinnati, Montgomery has 
April. “What will be next?” I won- 
dered as violets that had fringed gar- 
den walks all through February were 
overshadowed in March by the com- 
ing of bold scarlet japonicas attended 
by modest irises in purple, with gold 
daffodils to tight the way. But since 
April has come it’s almost impossible 
to. tell of the bright sights that make 
a rainbow bridge for the gods of sum- 
mer. 

Pomegranate blooms are oriental 
vermilion. White and yellow honey- 
suckle blooms trail downward from 
roadside trees. Purple verbenas steal 
like runaway children through the 
meadows. What will be left for June 
here? But the mocking birds do not 
trouble themselves with this problem. 

They are everywhere all day. Here 
and there flash the gray and white 
feathers and from all directions come 
the voices of these ventriloquists, even 
at night. Sometimes they are the car- 
dinal, and one is fairly well satisfied 
with the imitation till the vibrant trill 
of the real cardinal sounds and one 
hears among white oleanders the song 
that rang from snow tipped spruces. 
The bird in red seems more sincere 
than the medley singers, Catbird, 
Mocking bird and Thrasher. 

An old man told me that as a boy 
he caught cardinals to sell and got 
many cruel bites from their strong 
beaks. I saw another crested friend 
of mine, the waxwing, here in Mont- 
gomery early in March. I can call him

“friend” now though he seemed a bit- 
ter enemy to our childhood. Hosts of 
waxwings would come wheezing down 
into the cherry trees in June. And 
we children always feared that the 
cherries could not hold out for the 
canners, the children and the business- 
like waxwings. 

“There’re those old waxwings!” we 
would sigh as the brown host came to 
work like the Indian hop gatherers of 
the West. Yet cherries were plenti- 
ful and Junes were merry. Did you 
ever wonder at that quaint little name, 
“waxwing’? The bird gets it from 
the red spots on its wings. These re- 
minded some one of sealing wax.

QO speaks to a colored girl.” 
“She is always hobnobbing with those 
old white girls.” “I guess she thinks 
she is white.” “None of the colored 
girls like her.” And much more like 
this came from the lips of a talky bunch 
of High School girls while they were 
gathered to rehearse for a Christmas 
Play for their Church School. It was 
suggested by their leader that the girls 
possibly misunderstood the one they 
were so bitter against. This idea was 
laughed at in unvarnished girlish glee. 
But it took the very youngest girl in 
the group to muster up the courage to 
say: “Well, I heard that it is not be- 
cause she is ‘passing’, but because she 
wants to find out how white girls do 
things and since they like her, she says, 
she finds more pleasure with them than 
with the colored girls, who are always 
saying nasty, little senseless things 
about her.” 

Now, this is what appeared in the 
Record Book concerning this much dis- 
cussed “passing” member of the class 
of 192— of the High School, 


in . 
“Fis good will makes intelligence.” 
" is one of the most brillian 
Latin students and one of the famous 
Greek students in the section. The girl 
most in demand at lunch time is . 
for she is noted for her Latin transla- 














tions. She is always willing to lend a, 


helping hand to her classmates and on 
many occasions aids a friend who is in 
distress. Truly, she can explain many 
things which the teachers themselves 
find difficulty in putting into our 
brains. 

Hobby—Everybody’s Latin. 

Pet Expression—‘“I’ll do it for you.” 

Future—Greek Professor. 

Activities—Service Club, Classical 
Club, French Club, Athletic Club, 
Mathematics Club, Shakespeare Club.” 

This same “passing’’ girl received a 
scholarship from this unsegregated 
High School and is doing excellent 
work in one of the large Universities, 
now. The “talky” bunch knew of this 
girl’s fine qualities, but from their con- 
versation and their unwarranted opin- 
ions one would think that she verily 
was all they were making her out to be. 
And this despite the fact that none of 
their opinions coincided with the splen- 
did Class Book Record description of 
the kind of a girl she really and truly 
was and is. Why?

Why? 
By LENA WILLIAMS 


This is a study of the internal 
Negro problems — jealousy; envy; 
lack of appreciation of merit and 
effort; gossip and refusal to co- 


operate; all of the too human frail- 
ties and shortcomings which by no 
sort of logic can be blamed on any- 
one but our very own selves. 





The group included many different 
peoples, as it was in the now ever popu- 
lar Teacher’s College Department. 
Good marks had been the good fortune 
of one of Afric’s daughters in the class. 
This, strange enough, did not seem to 
cause much rejoicing on the part of the 
rest of Afric’s daughters in the class. 
We numbered three. Every two weeks 
rolled around rapidly. Essays and 
themes required at these intervals be- 
gan to pile up. Marks and comments 
on returned essays and themes began 
to be distributed. Some of us were 
made glad. Some of us became sad. 
Others got mad. The semester was 
drawing to a successful close for those 
who had been made glad. By way of 
diversion, the best themes were selected 


by the professor and the writer asked- 


to read them to the class from his desk. 
One day “Afric’s-daughter-of-the-good- 
marks” was seized with momentary 
strangulation because she was asked to 
come forward and read a theme. It 
was all over with! How glad Afric’s 
daughter felt! Her theme was the last 
of four selected that day. She had 
hardly finished when the glad closing 
bell, clarion and clear, rang in the hall. 
This was usually the mad rush-out, the 
grand exit, in haste and hurry. But not 
so today. This happened: at least 
three-fourths of the class came rushing 
up front, instead of out the hall door, 
to shower compliments upon the theme 
read, the reading and, yes, the reader. 

Of course “Li’l Afric” was very 
happy. Why not be? But then she was 
hurt, too. O, so hurt! Did you ask 
why? Well, as she was relating the 
day’s doings to her husband at dinner, 
she remembered that not one of her 
“sisters-in-color” had come to the plat- 
form to say one word! She remem- 
bered they had remained with the 
rather slim gang that rushed home. 
She wondered about this. Then she 
forgot about this. Why remember un- 
pleasant things? 

Often she was included in reading 
the themes group. Seldom she received 
a kind word from her “‘sisters-in-color” 
but always from her “sisters-who-were- 
not-colored.” But, one fine day, two 
of us were selected to read, out of the 
usual four. Thanks be! ‘“Afric’s- 


daughter-of-the-frequent-readings” was 


- so very glad that one more of her very 


own people had pushed up to this high 
place in the class activities. This was 
her chance, she mused, to show her sis- 
ter what she should have done on these 
other occasions of the previous read- 
ings. The former reader rushed up to 
her ebon-hued sister first, as the read- 
ers always took front seats in the class 
period. Her ebon-hued sister was look- 
ing straight at her when she ap- 
proached. But was it true or was it a 
mistake? No. It was too true! The 
“‘latter-reader-of-color” was too busy 
receiving the compliments of the others 
of the class to even notice a “‘sister-in- 
color.” At last, the “latter-reader-of- 
color” could not escape it, her hand was 
caught warmly by the first reader’s and 
words of sincere congratulation were 
spoken. No, there was no mistake, even 
this time. The one receiving the com- 
pliments was looking vaguely over the 
head of the one bestowing them, seem- 
ingly eager, only, for the compliments 
from the predominant race group of 
the class. The compliments being ten- 
dered by a real blood and race sister 
were at a noticeable discount when 
compared to those coming from the 
noble Nordics. Now the two of us 
were plain, ordinary colored persons. 
Neither could have “passed” had we 
wanted to be other than God had made 
us. But such racial unsisterliness! Such 
“unhuman” behaviour! Why?

We thought we knew the location 
of a playground we were asked to visit, 
but as we approached we saw no 
colored folk there and hesitated to go 
within. The playground was bristling 
with little white children, with eager- 
eyed and smiling-faced white mothers, 
with bigger and interested daughters 
and sons at their sides. We inquired 
of the one, and only, colored woman 
we saw, if this was the Play- 
ground. It was, we learned. We then 
timorously asked if Miss could 
be seen, as we had been asked to visit 
the closing exercises by her. Our in- 
formant did not know the teacher’s 
name, or anything about her from her 
vague look. We waited for her to re- 
turn, as we thought she left us to bring 
us some news of our friend and the 
teacher. We waited in vain. We 
possibly would have been waiting yet, 
had we not asked a white woman if the 
“teacher” was anywhere around. At 
once she called her daughter, whom 
she said was “dead in love” with the

66 HAT THE NEGRO 

THINKS”, by Robert Rus- 
sa Moton, Doubleday, Doran and 
Company. $2.50. “Rope and Fag- 
got”, a biography of Judge Lynch by 
Walter White. Knopf. $3.00. “Black 
America”, by Scott Nearing, Vanguard 
Press. $3.00. 


HREE books before me are of in- 

tense and vivid interest. One 
could not well imagine three essays on 
practically the same subject more di- 
verse in manner, treatment and con- 
clusion, and yet they all deal essential- 
ly with the same set of facts. Of 
course, there is great difference in em- 
phasis, in manner of approach, but they 
all are written by sincere men who seek 
the truth and follow it; who have 
given much of their lives toward hu- 
man knowledge and uplift. 





MOTON THINKS ALOUD! 


TURN, perhaps, naturally first to 

Dr. Moton’s “What the Negro 
Thinks”. This is a book that would 
have been unthinkable ten years ago 
and would have caused something 
like a riot twenty years ago. It 
is, on the whole, the best thing that 
has come out of Tuskegee. Even, 
when one remembers “Up From 
Slavery” and Industrial Education it- 
self, it is best because it is frank and 
clear. 

“Up From Slavery”, the biography 
of Booker T. Washington, was a work 
of art with characteristic reticences and 
careful arrangement. Dr. Moton’s book 
is straight-forward and candid. He 
has left his old habit of merely saying 
something nice for the consumption of 
white folks; he has dropped most of 
his jokes, and written a straight-for- 
ward word which will receive the as- 
sent of practically every Negro reader, 
and cannot be gainsaid by white 
readers. 

The book is divided into eleven chav- 
ters. The first chapter is called “I 
Know the Negro”, and it ends with 
the word: “ ‘Know the Negro!’ When 
a white man boasts of it, he simply dis- 
closes how little he knows of this race.” 

The Second Chapter is on knowing 
the white man, and the author points 
out that the Negro “has a far better 
chance of knowing the white man than 
the latter has of knowing the Negro.” 

Chapter Three is about the advanc- 
ing Negro. “This advance in intelli- 


196 








| THE BROWSING READER | 
ea 


gence, culture and worldly estate that 
this particular element of the race has 
made, has convinced them by oppres- 
sion and comparison that there is no 
essential difference between white peo- 
ple and black people to warrant such 
discriminations as is practiced against 
all Negroes.” 

The Fourth Chapter notes the fre- 
quent effort to settle the Negro prob- 
lem. ‘From the beginning, however, 
the attempt has been made to fix per- 
manently the status of the Negro and 
so remove the subject from public dis- 
cussion and agitation. But it refuses 
to stay fixed, and this largely because 
the chief factor in the problem—the 
Negro himself—has had no place at the 
council table when the adjustments 
were made.” 


Then in 3 chapters, Mr. Moton con- 
siders Negro disabilities: segregation, 
“‘jim-crow” cars, schools, housing, the 
ballot, the courts; and in every single 
case, instead of the hedging and special 
pleading that many of us have always 
expected from Tuskegee, his statements 
are almost without exception the sort 
of thing that we ourselves could have 
said. “No phase of discrimination 
against the Negro touches the race more 
widely or intimately than segregation.” 
There is a description of the difficul- 
ties of “jim-crow” cars and street 
cars; of Pullman travel; of food while 
traveling; of waiting rooms and ticket 
offices; of treatment on the trains; of 
steamboat lines and bus lines; and the 
final declaration that all this segrega- 
tion “is regarded as the most humiliat- 
ing form of racial discrimination with 
the least substantial excuse of justifica- 
tion.” The school situation is ex- 
plained and it is shown that separate 
schools mean “distinctly discrimination, 
neglect and inferior provisions for the 
Negro.” 

“The thinking Negro refuses to ac- 
cept the idea that race prejudice is na- 
tural and inevitable, that it is inherent 
in the child, either white or black. He 
insists that it is acquired and cultivated, 
and that the greatest single aid to its 
cultivation is segregation.” 

Mr. Moton then goes on to explain 
the feeble line of demarcation today be- 
tween the N. A. A. C. P., on the one 
hand, and the Hampton and Tuskegee 
School of thought on the other, and he 
concludes fairly: 

“The two groups are alike opposed 
to legal segregation in principle; both 


a 


De 


regard it as undemocratic and unchris- 
tian, as unfair in principle as well as in 
practice. In truth, they are working for 
the same thing in different spheres and 
by a different approach.” 


In the same way the housing diff- 
culty is frankly set forth; the record of 
the Negro in Reconstruction is defend- 
ed, and despite any murmurings from 
the grave of Booker T. Washington, 
the author writes: 

“The thinking Negro insists that the 
white man’s civilization is as safe with 
a ballot in his hands as it is with a bul- 
let or bayonet.” 

Dr. Moton arraigns the courts for 
injustice and defends Negro office-hold- 
ing. He explains the case of the Tus- 
kegee Hospital and says: 

“The Negro feels that the nation has 
declared itself once for all in the 
amendments to the Constitution on the 
question of equality of all of its citi- 
zens. With this as justification he is 
resolved to realize in fact by every 
honourable, righteous, and peaceable 
means what has been thus established 
in principle at such great cost both of 
blood and of treasure.” 

Then follow three chapters of con- 
clusions. “The disabilities of the 
Negro in the law and the discrimina- 


‘ tions against him in the government are 


merely the reflections of a deeper and a 
stronger public sentiment which goes 
beyond the law and exceeds the gov- 
ernment in making distinctions between 
black and white in our republic, to the 
advantage of the white and the disad- 
vantage of the black.” 

The Negro’s reaction to this is noted. 
“Any Negro, every Negro burns with 
indignation when he pays full first- 
class fare for a railroad ticket and then 
has to ride in a crowded, odorous, 
flimsy, dirty, second-class coach. There 
is no one word to describe the complex 
of his emotions when a Pullman ticket 
agent tells him he has no space, and 
he then, going around the corner and 
calling the agent over the ’phone, is 
told that there is plenty of space. Only 
the word ‘contempt’ describes his emo- 
tional reaction when, after reading of 
a ‘black brute’ done to death by a ‘quiet, 
orderly mob’ accompanied by women 
and children, on the next day he reads 
of young colored girls ravaged by a 
member of one of the ‘best white fam- 
ilies’ who is later declared ‘insane’; and 
then recalls that a short while before

“A while ago a couple of young babies 
from down south saw a colored member 
of the employed staff taking a shower. 
Their southern limitations, traditions and 
other handicaps rebelled and they com- 
plained. They complained rather fresh- 
ly, high-hatedly, superiorly, and super- 
ciliously, if you get what we mean. Now 
it just happened that the colored gentle- 
man was in every way far superior to 
the white boys; he was manifestly better 
educated, he holds a responsible position 
here, has a wife and family, owns his 
home, has a savings account and insur- 
ance, is Superintendent of the Sunday 
School of the church which he helped or- 
ganize, and he is a lay preacher; and he 
brought a younger sister to America ana 
was the means of seeing her through col- 
lege. This sister now holds an A.B. 
from a prominent eastern high seat of 
learning. His good breeding was _ in- 
stantly proven: he suggested that the 
complaint be rendered to the proper au- 
thority, the Dormitory Secretary, and 
refused to partake in any altercation 
which the lads from cotton and tobacco 
land were willing to start. 

“Scrappy babies from the south who 
haven’t as yet clawed themselves from 
the foolish tradition plus the caste system 
should realize that they are up north 
where at least a greater measure of 
freedom is accorded all. They might 
also remember that they are in a Chris- 
tian organization, and that Jesus Christ 
was interested in people and attitudes 
and souls and hearts and minds—not in 
color.”

liminary examination, that no former 
Negro applicant had satisfied the tech- 
nical requirements for admission. These 
requirements are rules of the Superior 
Court and, in addition to residence for 
one year and certifications of integrity 
and good moral character, are as fol- 
lows: 

“1, Passing a preliminary examina- 
tion; (2) Registration as a student of 
law for six months in the office of a 
lawyer who has been in practice in the 
courts of Delaware for at least ten 
years; (3) Passing a final examination 
on the principles of law and equity. 

“It is not difficult to understand that 
if a settled prejudice against Negroes 


June, 1929 


did exist the requirement numbered two 
could be readily employed as an effective 
barrier to their admission.” 

Mr. Redding confidentially believes: 

“That in the future every Negro who 
qualifies for membership in the Dela- 
ware Bar will be admitted on the basis 
of that qualification.” 


Mr. Redding was educated at the 
Howard High School, Wilmington, 
and Brown University and Harvard 


Law School. 
THE SOUTH EAST 
@ Daisy Wimberly Thrope, a white 


columnist, writes in the Macon Tele- 
graph, a white Southern paper: 


“Macon has an unknown soldier of 
her own. A soldier, unknown to, him- 
self, who has never worn a uniform or 
heard the din of battle. He has never 
carried a musket even, but he has carried, 
and still carries, the bravest heart and 
sacrificial courage that constitutes a hero. 

“The usual throng of business men 
and women were hastening on, one 
morning in the pursuit of their different 
duties, when a crashing of glass from 


within Thorpe’s Clothing store sent a 
warning of danger to each and every 
one of them. A terrific explosive crash 
followed which sent steam, blinding 
smoke along with an avalanche of crum- 
bling timbers, through every passage and 
opening. One agonized scream from a 
woman and all was still—save from the 
mass of settling ashes and tottering brick 
front that told of the destruction and 
ruin behind it. 


“The throng had fled to safety zones 
to send out calls for help—all but one. 
This one, only a slip of a youth leaped 
in the face of death to a landing on the 
tottering wall, smashed with his selfless 
valiant hands, the panes of a window 
that stood between assistance and the cry 
of distress ready “not to reason why,” 
ready “but to do and die. 

“When stopped by a shout from below 
that all were saved and unhurt, he hum- 
bly breathed a prayer of thanks, and 
escaped, unhurt himself. Before thanks 
or praise for his meritorious heroism 
could be proffered, he had vanished—un- 
known. 


“And he was one of Macon’s sons,— 
not a white one but a Negro.”

@ The Second Fact-Finding Confer- 
ence met in Durham, North Carolina 
April 17th-19th. The most important 
speeches were made by Allison Davis 
of Hampton on “A Crisis in Negro 
Education”; W. C. Matney of Blue- 
field Institute, on “Co-operative Busi- 
ness’; and “The Recent Trends in 
Employment in Negro Labor’, by T. 
Arnold Hill. The Conference is be- 
coming a forum for plain talk and truth 
telling. Dr. J. E. Sheppherd is presi- 
dent. 

@ Lucius FE. Williams, is dead in 
Savannah. Thirty-five years ago he 
came from Americus, where he was 
born in 1871, and for fifteen years had 
been a mail clerk. He organized and 
became first president of the Wage 
Earners’ Loan and Investment Com- 
pany. Afterward, this company became

a bank and he became its President. It 
was chartered in 1913 and for a time 
was the leading colored bank in the 
country. Unfortunately, about four 
years ago, Mr. Williams suffered a 
paralytic stroke. He tried to keep up 
his wise supervision of the banking af- 
fairs but the bank failed last year. 


@ In Bryan County, Georgia, the 
names of Jews have systematically been 
eliminated from the Jury Box. The 
Jews appealed to the courts, and in 
April the Supreme Court of Georgia 
upheld the demand of Jews to have 
their names in the Jury Box. In most 
counties of Georgia, Negroes are simi- 
larly excluded from Jury lists.

francisement is shown by the attempt 
of the Board of Education in Savan- 
nah to move the colored Beach High 
School from the city to the campus of 
the colored State College outside the 
city limits. The colored citizens are 
up in arms at a proposal which would 
make their children go five miles out 
of the city for high school training. 


@ Last year there were built in 
Georgia 17 modern school houses at a 
cost of $110,930. Of this cost, $82,- 
091 came from public funds, $16,600 
from the Rosenwald Fund, $9,114 
from Negroes, $1,900 from white peo- 
ple, and $1,225 from the General Edu- 
cation Board. During 1929, 5 more 
schools have been built. In the whole 
state, there are 220 of these Rosen- 
wald schools.

@ James Henry Coit Butler was born 
in Savannah, Georgia, 1852. He was 
educated at Beach Institute and At- 
lanta University, and eventually be- 
came Principal of the West Broad 
Street School, where he taught for 
nearly fifty years, until his death in 
1921. Our picture is from the me- 
morial painting by, E. A. Harleston. 


THE MIDDLE WEST 


@ The University of Chicago staged 
a tribute to “Womanhood” in April. 
Strong pressure was brought to keep 
colored women from participating, but 
the managers of the affair refused to 
discriminate, and all races were repre- 
sented. The affair was notably suc- 
cessful. : 

@ A cast of 575 colored actors gave a 
pageant “Milestones” recently in 
Cleveland before a packed house at the 
public Music Hall. The Pageant was 
directed by its author, Mrs. Ada Crog-

@ Schuyler Phillips lives in Kalama- 
zoo, Michigan, and is 56 years of age. 
He was a soldier in the Spanish Ameri- 
can War; a rider in Buffalo Bill’s 
Wild West Show; a business man and 
a leader. He received only a common 
school education, became a cook on a 
Great Lakes steamer and then opened 
a restaurant in Minneapolis. He 
helped build the State Capitol at St. 
Paul, Minneapolis; organized the col- 
ored Federation of Labor in Kalama- 
zoo, and the local branch of the N. A. 
A. C. P. He has been Notary Public 
and deputy Sheriff. He has held high 
place in many of the fraternities. Re- 
cently, he has been developing a re- 
ligious center and Tabernacle at Box- 
holder Beach. He is at present sick 
with a heart ailment and several hun- 
dred people, over half of them white, 
have visited his home during his ill- 
ness. 


@ The “Grand River Boulevard Im- 
provement Association” of Detroit, 
Michigan, has been organized to make 
the Northwestern section of Detroit 
“as desirable as possible”, both for resi- 
dents and business purposes. One sec- 
tion of the Constitution says: 

“In order to attain this purpose it is 
necessary to restrict membership to peo- 
ple of the Caucasian race and use all 
possible means of excluding all others 
from and within the designated area.” 

There are a few colored people al- 
ready living in this section of the city. 


“SOUTH CENTRAL STATES 
@ April 19th to 21st there was held 


a three-day festival of music and fine 
arts at Fisk University. All of the 
musical orga:izations of the campus 
acted as hosts to the Fisk Jubilee Sing- 
ers just home from Europe. On Sun- 
day afternoon the Mozart Society sang 
Bach’s Chorales, Palestrina’s Exultate 
Deo, 12th Century church music, Rus- 
sian songs and Norwegian melodies. 
John W. Work, Miss Ruth Shappell 
and James A. Myers directed the mu- 
sic. The art exhibit of the Harmon 
Foundation was exhibited during the 
Festival. 

@ Fisk University will close its fiscal 
year with all bills paid. The Univer- 
sity has received this year $250,000 
from the Rosenwald Fund and the 
General Education Board and $400,- 
000 from the General Education 
Board for a library. The estate of 
James D. Burrus will net the Univer- 
sity $120,000 instead of $100,000. Dr. 
George E. Haynes of New York City 
has been elected Alumni Trustee for 
two years. The other Alumni trustees 
are Dr. F. A. Stewart of Nashville, 
Dr. William N. DeBerry of Spring- 
field, Massachusetts, Mrs. M. L. 
Crosthwaite of Detroit. 

@ The Louisiana Reality and Finance 
Company with an authorized capital of

@ Dan Desdunes, a famous band 
leader of Omaha, Nebraska, died April 
24th. He was organizer and leader of 
the best musical organization of its 
kind in the Middle West. For twelve 
years he gave instruction in music at 
Father Flannagan’s Boys Home and at 
the time of his death was instructing a 
white band at Louisville, Nebraska. 
Desdunes’ band has played at state and 
county fairs in the Central West for 


201 





years. The white Masons offered their 
temple for the funeral services and the 
funeral was the largest given any col- 
ored person in the history of the state 
of Nebraska. Mr. Desdunes is sur- 
vived by a widow and a son, who is also 
a musician. 


@ The class in Sociology of Kansas 
University recently made a tour of the 
Negro business and residential center 
of Kansas City. Three colored stu- 
dents and 28 white students were in the 
group, 

@ The Des Moines, Iowa, Register 
says editorially : 

“A Debate was held recently in Chi- 
cago between Dr. Du Bois of THE 
Crisis and Lothrop Stoddard whose 
‘Rising Tide of Color’ has been widely 
read. Technically, the question was the 
Negro’s right to ‘cultural’ equality. In 
fact it was the Negro’s right to the 
opportunties and privileges of the other 
racial groups. The mere fact that such 
a debate was held is of itself signifi- 
cant. 

“However it may work out, everybody 

must see that the real problem before 
all the peoples is the ultimate working 
relations of these racial groups to each 
other, for they are all here and appar- 
ently all here to stay, and they are too 
numerous and too nearly equal in ca- 
pacity for any one of them to assert a 
dominating superiority and maintain it. 
Whether in the end it results in the 
‘cultural equality’ Dr. DuBois argues 
for, or the ‘social’ equality Lothrop Stod- 
dard points to in warning, the fact re- 
mains that some sort of working rela- 
tion must be set up which all be willing 
to accept as better than an unending 
struggle for racial supremacy.” 
@ Mrs. Isabel B. Lindsay, senior 
worker at the Mason District Provi- 
dent Association, St. Louis, has been 
selected as the St. Louis member of the 
Institute, sponsored by the American 
Association for Organizing Family So- 
cial Work. This Institute meets an- 
nually in New York City and is com- 
posed of twenty workers from as many 
different cities, each worker the select- 
ed representative of the family welfare 
agency in her city. It is arranged for 
intensive study of selected phases of 
social work. 


@ Mrs. Lindsay is the second colored 
worker so honored in St. Louis, as 
Mrs. Gladys Carrion Gray was select- 
ed as the member in 1927. Mrs. Lind- 
say is a graduate of Howard Univer- 
sity and a member of Alpha Kappa 
Alpha Sorority. She has done post 
graduate work at the New York School 
of Social Service.

been an active Little Theatre among 
the white folk. The interest has now 
spread to the colored people and Louis

J. Hexter, the leader of the white 
group, has been training some colored

@ Mrs. Julia Caldwell-Frazier is 
dead at Dallas, Texas. For more than 
20 years she taught Latin in the 
Booker T. Washington High School

WEST AFRICA 


@ The Honorable W. T. Francis, 
United States Minister to Liberia, is 
scheduled to return home on a sixty 
days’ leave of absence during July. 

@ The 4th session of the National 
Congress of West Africa took place at 
Lagos, Nigeria, April 7th to April 
21st. 

@ It is rumored that an attempt will 
soon be made to abolish the Bachelor 
of Arts course in Fourah Bay College, 
Sierra Leone, West Africa. If this is 
done, it will be in accordance with the 
recommendation of the Thomas Jesse 
Jones Committee and will mean the 
closing of the only effective Negro col- 
lege at present in West Africa. 

@ The Bishop of Accra estimates that 
the native alcoholic drink bill on the 
Gold Coast amounts to $12,500,000 a 
year. The leading Africans are in 
favor of prohibition, but English mer- 
chants object. 

@ The French are constructing a 
railroad to unite Brazzaville with Black 
Point, on the Coast. This railroad 
will be the only outlet for products of 
the French Congo. It was begun in 
1921 and so far is said to have cost 
17,000 human lives! All of the work 
is done by hand and by forced labor 
under the whips of overseers. The re- 
sult has been an uprising, which is be- 
ing put down by bloody measures; but 
no exact information is allowed to leak 
through. 

@ Herbert MacCauley, who was 
sentenced to six months’ imprisonment 
at Lagos, was released February 26th. 


There are 14 institutions do- ° 


The Nigerian Government has only 
made him a martyr and given him 
greater popular support than ever. 


SOUTH AFRICA 


@ The South African election takes 
place June 12th. If the South African 
party wins, the native bills will be dead 
and the policy of laisser faire will be 
resumed, since the followers of General 
Smuts are hopelessly divided on the na- 
tive question. If Hertzog remains 
Prime Minister, the native bills can- 
not be adopted, as their passing requires 
a larger majority than he possibly can 
expect. 

@ A number of distinguished white 
men of South Africa have issued a 
warning manifesto. It concludes: 

“Tf the Bantu develop and full citizen- 
ship is denied them, there is bound in the 
end to be a clash. It would no doubt 
be possible to keep them down by force, 
but force has never proved a lasting 
remedy, least of all in South Africa. A 
denial of full civic rights to a civilized 
Bantu people would mean a challenge to 
all non-European peoples of Africa and 
not of Africa alone. It might precipitate 
a racial struggle, the possibilities of 
which are too dreadful to contemplate, 
especially in their impact on European 
civilization in this country.” 


EAST AFRICA 


@ Lord Delamere of Kenya and his 
party in East Africa, comprising less 
than one per cent of the population, 
are demanding political control of three 
million natives. In 1923, the Duke of 
Devonshire, Secretary of the Colonies, 
denied this demand, declaring “the in- 
terests of the natives must be para- 


mount.” Notwithstanding this, the 
Ormsby-Gore Commission was ap- 
pointed. This Commission declared 


that the demand of the whites for re- 
sponsible government, was out of the 
question. But the whites were not 
satisfied. They continued their argu- 
ment. Mr. Amery, Secretary of the 
State for the colonies then appointed 
the Hilton-Young Commission. This 
Commission in its recent report prac- 
tically agrees with previous commis- 
sions, but the whites now declare that 
the only scheme which they will accept 
is one with a legislature with a white 
majority. The British Government 
has appointed a joint committee of 
both Houses to consider the Hilton 
Young Report. 


INDIA 


@ The World’s Student Conference 
met at Mysore City, in December. The 
Maharajah granted the use of an open 
camp to the delegates. Practically 
every country in the world was rep- 
resented, including the Negroes of the 
United States.

THE OPPORTUNITY OF 
ATLANTA 


T last the way is open for Atlanta 
University to come into its own. 

No institution in the world has the 
opportunity which this old and deserv- 
ing institution has lately been offered. 

Atlanta University has long been a 
pioneer, and a pioneer in causes that 
cost. It stood for higher education 
when the higher education of Negroes 
was a matter of criticism and ridicule. 
It stood for the social equality of 
teachers and students, when both 
threats and inducements were offered 
it to make it draw the color line in its 
own dining room and in its public meet- 
ings. In the day when Hampton, 
Tuskegee and many leading schools 
bowed to that prejudice, Atlanta held 
its unwavering ideal. Atlanta began 
the scientific study of the American 
Negro before a single other institution 
of learning in America offered a course 
of lectures on the Negro problem or 
made any attempt to measure or study 
the black man. 

As a result, Atlanta University was 
silently condemned, boycotted by phil- 
anthropy, and faced with starvation. 

One excuse on the part of the great 
endowments for not helping Atlanta 
University was that the city of At- 
lanta, like Nashville, New Orleans, 
Raleigh and other centers, had too 
many competing colored institutions 
and that it was hard to choose between 
them. This was true. At Atlanta 
was not only Atlanta University, but 
Morehouse College, Spellman College, 
Morris Brown College, Clark Uni- 
versity and Gammon Theological Semi- 
nary; not to mention several smaller 
private schools and the whole public 
school system. 

For many years hints were thrown 
out that if some method of uniting 
these institutions were voluntarily 
adopted, endowment would be forth- 
coming. But such voluntary action was 
difficult for the separate Boards and the 
separate bodies of alumni. Impulse and 
encouragement from without was ab- 
solutely necessary. At last, however, 
interests representing three of these 
institutions and certain of the endowed 
educational funds have evolved a solu- 
tion which is at once ingenious and 


June, 1929 


hopeful. There is to be in Atlanta a 
men’s college, Morehouse, and a wo- 
men’s college, Spellman, and the two 
are to be represented on the Board of 
a Graduate School—Atlanta Uni- 
versity. 

While no plans beyond this have 
formulated, it is not too much to hope 
that the’ other schools will gradually 
enter this greater university—Clark, 
perhaps, as a boarding high school and 
theological seminary; Morris Brown 
as an institute of technology or some- 
thing of the sort. 

So great a change must bring some- 
thing of sacrifice and regret. More- 
house and Spellman must give up am- 
bitions for graduate work and send 
their brightest students to Atlanta Uni- 
versity. Atlanta must surrender its 
famous undergraduate body and the 
college spirit of other days. But such 
sacrifice is more than compensated for 
by the vista of accomplishment which 
a Negro graduate School faces. 


4A GRADUATE SCHOOL 
ROVISION for undergraduate 


college work for Negroes is grad- 
ually being provided for: at larger col- 
leges, like Howard, Fisk, Virginia 
State, Virginia Union, Wiley, Talla- 
dega and others; at Hampton and 
Tuskegee and the land grant colleges; 
at many state and private colleges in 
the North where discrimination is not 
prohibitive. 

For professional training, we have 
two medical and dental schools, one 
law school, and several theological 
seminaries—a meagre list, supplement- 
ed by white schools where discrimina- 
tion is widespread, especially in medi- 
cine. The new Meharry will be a 
God-send here. :; 

But for graduate study, we must, 
with few exceptions, depend upon 
Northern institutions. Most of these 
institutions are quietly doing every- 
thing they can to discourage and ex- 
clude Negro students. Such students 
who are well equipped in mind, money 
and courage, continue and must con- 
tinue to force themselves in to Har- 
vard, Chicago,’ Columbia and other 
universities. But the man who needs 
encouragement and lacks funds and 
yet has the mental equipment will be 


lost to the race and the world unless 
we have a Graduate School in the 
South. 


Such a Graduate School should offer 
first-class courses in the social sciences, 
history and economics; in the physical 
sciences, in biology, chemistry and psy- 
chology, in all those great fields of 
knowledge, where the Negro student 
has been practically excluded by draw- 
ing of the color line in all but the 
most exceptional cases. C. H. Turner, 
one of the great world authorities on 
insects, nearly entered the faculty of 
Chicago University; but the head pro- 
fessor, who called him, died, and his 
successor would not have a “Nigger”, 
despite a reputation which was Euro- 
pean; Turner died in a high school of 
neglect and overwork. Earnest Just, 
one of the two or three greatest au- 
thorities on the origin of life, got his 
chance to study by an act of private 
philanthropy. None of the great uni- 
versities would dare give him an ap- 
pointment. Fuller, a leading Ameri- 
can pioneer in psychiatry, was refused 
appointment by hospital after hospital, 
simply because his grandfather was a 
Negro. Psychological measurements 
of Negroes have been almost confined 
to white folk unacquainted with Ne- 
groes or unsympathetic, because Negro 
psychologists could get no laboratory 
experience. Our history has been 
written by our enemies; all Egyptian 
and Ethiopian history and the history 
of the Sudan has been written by white 
men who, save in a few cases, hold 
American and English prejudices 
against Negroes. The Harvard Expe- 
dition under Reisner has been recently 
excavating Ethiopia and raising heaven 
and earth to disparage Negro blood 
and misinterpret Negro history. We 
have had a little chance in engineering, 
in physics, in chemistry, in the whole 
great field of modern technology, chief- 
ly because no matter what our gifts 
were, no chance was given us to pre- 
pare and no career promised after prep- 
aration. 


In the field of languages and litera- 
tures there is much to beckon us; 
Arabic and Amharic, the 400 tongues 
of Africa, the dark treasures of Span- 
ish and Portuguese, the tongues of 
Asia and the isles. 


203 


Here, then, are the fields open to At- 
lanta University, if it receives, as now 
seems probable, adequate and uncir- 
cumscribed endowment. The old heads 
of the General Education Board, who 
believed in the Baptist faith, white su- 
premacy and industrial training for Ne- 
groes, are gradually being gathered to 
their fathers with the blessings of God 
and the benediction of the faithful. In 
their place are coming a few men with 
vision, unblinded by color. If these 
men can be induced to make a real 
opening in the field of science for Ne- 
gra mind and genius, a gate-way will 
be opened in the world which may in 
time transform it. 


To some to say this is to laugh. But 
is it a laughing matter to stifle one- 
tenth of a nation’s genius when the 
total is so pitiably small? 


JOHN HOPE 
HE CRISIS knows of no better 


man to lead a great new Grad- 
uate School than John Hope. Little 
has been said and written of John Hope 
because he is not the kind of man that 
wants or allows personal reference. 
But in a day when it is perhaps all too 
natural that Negro leaders with Amer- 
ican ‘“‘push” should be jostling each 
other into the limelight and not only 
modestly accepting but almost blatant- 
ly demanding recognition, John Hope 
has been an example of modest, untir- 
ing devotion to high ideals. He has 
worked and served quietly for thirty 
years as teacher and executive, as the 
friend of Youth and Manhood, and as 
one whose disinterested advice, bal- 
anced judgment, and sane outlook has 
been widely sought and followed. 
John Hope was born in Georgia in 
1868 and was educated at Worcester 
Academy and Brown; he taught 12 
years and for 22 years has been Presi- 
dent of Moerhouse College. He went 
to the front as “Y” worker during the 
war and he has been a man of wide 
and intelligent public interests and yet 
withal silent and modest, self-sacrific- 
ing and self-forgetful. 


Since the war, he has faced every 
difficulty of organization and criticism, 
and yet, with all this, he has kept his 
soul, his sweet temper, and his sense 
of humor. He counts real personal 
friends among white folk and black, 
Northerners and Southerners. He is 
better suited than any living American 
by education and temperament, by ex- 
perience and high ideal, to launch this 
forward movement of the Negro in- 
teliect. He deserves the whole-hearted 
support of every friend of the higher 
training of black men, and of all lovers 
of mankind.

THE STUDENTS OF LINCOLN 
INCOLN UNIVERSITY has 


130 Juniors and Seniors. Recent- 
ly, Langston Hughes, one of the Sen- 
iors, distributed a questionnaire among 
these students. Lincoln has never had 
a Negro Professor, although it has 
some colored instructors. The ques- 
tionnaire asked these students whether 
or not they were in favor of having 
colored and white professors, or only 
white professors. The answers to this 
and other questions have been pub- 
lished by the Afro-American and we 
have been assured officially by the au- 
thorities of Lincoln that the facts given 
are substantially correct. 

Of 127 students answering, 81 were 
opposed to having colored professors! 
This is the most astonishing blow 
which the higher education of» Negroes 
in the United States has received for 
many a year. Grasp its significance: 
suppose that English students should 
declare by a nearly two-thirds majority 
that they did not wish to be taught by 
Englishmen, because they doubted if 
Englishmen had either the brains or 
the character to be their teachers. Or, 
worse than this, take the case of Chi- 
nese students where the nation has just 
grievance against white Europe; and 
imagine two-thirds of the students in 
a leading Chinese University voting 
that they did not want any Chinese 
professors, but preferred to have Eu- 
ropean professors! 

This is what Lincoln University has 
done, and it focusses the light upon this 
institution where many persons have 
long had the uneasy feeling that things 
were not well. There can be, on the 
one hand, no doubt of the service of 
Lincoln to the nation. The men which 
she has sent out and scattered over all 
the United States are leading citizens 
and deserving workers. If their suc- 
cess proved that Negroes can only be 
taught by white folks, then the Ne- 
gro race in America and in the world 
is indeed an inferior race. But this 
cannot be true because just as worthy 
and gifted Negroes have come out into 
the world from Howard, Fisk, At- 
lanta, and a dozen other institutions 
where Negro teachers have long been 
on the teaching force. 

Manifestly, therefore, the success of 
Lincoln graduates has been in spite of 
race discrimination and not because of 
it, and the attitude of these under- 
graduates is not so much a proof of 
their lack of either sense or shame, as 
an astonishing indictment of the teach- 
ing of their white professors. If the 
result of their teaching is to train up 
young men to be ashamed or doubt- 
ful of themselves and their darker 
fellows, the white teachers have pat- 
ently failed in their duty. This 


does not mean that they have delib- 





erately taught this message or con- 
sciously inculcated disrespect for Ne- 
groes; but it does mean they certainly 
have not actively and conscientiously 
instilled in thier students a knowledge 
of what the Negro has done in the 
past, or what he is doing now, and of 
what he is capable of doing. 

Indeed, this sort of thing is just 
what white men in the very nature of 
the case cannot teach even if they tried, 
just as Negro professors alone cannot 
wholly and completely present the case 
and attitude of the white world. Here 
lies the strength of the argument for 
a mixed faculty in all schools. This is 
the reason for importing foreign pro- 
tessors and lecturers and for increasing 
the contact of races in colleges. The 
failure of Lincoln to do this is bearing 
bitter fruit, and any persons, even grad- 
vates of Lincoln themselves, who have 
sons to send to college would do well 
to hesitate before putting them in an 
institution where they are liable to 
emerge with no faith in their own par- 
ents, or in themselves. Is it not time 
that the graduates of Lincoln aroused 
themselves and took firm hold of this 
threatening situation? 


PAUL KENNADAY 
AUL KENNADAY is lying out in 


Greenwood beneath a_ great 
mound of flowers. It seems queer 
that he should be there. He was earn- 
est and calm, sane and humorous. He 
was one of those who walks quietly but 
firmly along the solid earth. He was 
my friend. We did not talk much but 
we understood. He particularly un- 
derstood and grew tense under the 
knowledge. For him the world was 
wicked but possible. He worked at it. 
He was not willing to sit down and 
stare about. The thing was too real, 
too humanly real to ignore. And so 
year in and year out he worked 
and inquired and helped. And then 
he died. Suddenly he died, in the 
midst of his manhood, comely in 
face and ripe in heart. He said 
as he lay stricken: “I must at- 
tend a Crisis Committee Meeting to- 
morrow.” And attend he did in spirit, 
not in body. And now he is not here. 
He will not sit with quiet eyes and 
measured word listening to my troubles 
and the troubles of the world. I am 
puzzled by the lack of all logic in his 
going; by the world’s loss. Why, he 
was one of the first to form that group 
of 1909 which made the N. A. A. 
C. P. He was Chairman of THE 
Crisis Committee. I wonder—and 
yet somehow I like to think of him ly- 
ing there in the Spring sunshine be- 
neath the flowers, eternally and per- 
fectly at rest.

The World War! Migration! The

Softly, softly, my heart overflows. 
The great Voice whispers into

I see the principal through the sales

hard times. I hear again the 
prayers of Thanksgiving uttered near 
the close of the school year with not a

$5,000.00 came. The first ex- 
periment with a fall garden that prac- 
tically fed the school until Christmas

Loss of confidence, disappointment, 
poverty, being misjudged — brought 
wakeful nights, heartaches that tried 
the faith and patience, but a Christian 
institution has been establislied, occu- 
pied by people of refined, cultured 
habits, and whose physical plant is 
pleasing to the eye. The efforts have 
not been in vain. Thank God. Amen. 
Amen. 

We plan a great celebration during 
May 22-29th, paying homage to 25 
years of two lives spent in service. A 
quarter of a century of devotion. . .

Jonny Tunes Up 
(Continued from page 191) 


the following: “Jonny is a Negro 
saxophone player, and is favored by a 
chambermaid, Yvonne, who might be 
described by that pleasing German ad- 
jective ‘lebenslustige’. Anita the opera 
singer is his for the asking. Jonny dis- 
dains both women in favor of the 
precious violin possessed by Daniello.” 

Just before the American premier, 
we find a few more such comments. F. 
D. Perkins in the Herald-Tribune of 
July 8, 1928, describes Jonny as a 
white black-face comedian—a sort of 
Al Jolson! W. J. Henderson in the 
New York Sun of January 12, 1929, 
“shrinks from the adventure of telling 
the story” and leaves out everything. 
“Some of the sting has been abstract- 
ed,” he writes, “by transforming the 
Harlemitish Jonny into a white man 
masquerading as a Negro. Krenek’s 
challenge is that the world will be con- 
quered by the Negro race, who will sit 
atop it, howling blues and mammy 
songs in defiance of the rest of the 
human family.” Clair Holt in the 
New York World of January 13, 
1929, says: ‘““The adventures of Jonny, 
the ragamuffin Negro jazz-band play- 
er, enchanted by the white Anita, steal- 
ing the precious Amati violin, climb- 
ing at the end on top of the world to 
strike up a tune for America’s jazz 
victory—all this is not the usual con- 
ception of an operatic theme.” Why 
did she not voice this same sentiment 
when “Skyscrapers” was produced at 
the Metropolitan several seasons ago? 

But there was one rift in the fog: 
Henry Casson Becker in the Musical 
Review of February 28, 1928, wrote: 
“The hero is a Negro, leader of a jazz- 
band, and an important portion of the 
plot is concerned with the hero’s court- 
ship of a beautiful primadonna. I ex- 
plained the opera to someone ‘high in 
the councils of dignified opera produc- 
tion in New York’ and was told that I 
should be ashamed of myself for having 
sat through such an opera. I was 
dumbfounded for I had not bargained 
on this point of view. I made stam- 
mering references to Aida, Otello, 
L’Africana and other such operas but 
to no avail. He told me that in these

cases the circumstances of color were 
not offensive. But Jonny is different!” 
Lawrence Gilman in the Herald- 
Tribune of January 13, 1929, vents 
his sarcasm on the Metropolitan ver- 
sion. 


Krenek’s opera was produced at the 
Metropolitan Opera House, New 
York City, last season. There were 
some extraordinary precautions. In 
the dramatis personae of the Metro- 
politan program appears: “Jonny, a 
black-face comedian and jazz-band vio- 
linist.” Jonny has become white! 
Eddie Cantor, in the absence of Al 
Jolson, coached Michael Bohnen for 
the part of “Jonny”! Just under the 
caste was the notice: “Correct librettos 
for sale in the Lobby.” This notice has 
seldom or never appeared on other 
opera programs. Gatti-Casazza evi- 
dently wanted to guard against those 
who might buy their libretti from the 
vendors on the streets and be shocked 
by what they read therein. He and his 
staff carefully went over the text and 
changed the original German, and this 
altered tale was the one printed in the 
“correct librettos for sale in the 
Lobby.” At the bottom of this libretto 
was the footnote: “The German text 
of Mr. Krenek’s book, as here pre- 
sented, represents the authorized ver- 
sion of the libretto as prepared for the 
performance at the New York Metro- 
politan Opera House.” 

When Jonny first sees Anita in the 
corridor of the Parisian hotel, he ex- 
claims, in the original text, “O, by 
Jove, die weisse Frau ist schon! (O, 
by Jove, the white lady is beautiful!)” 
Of course, a white black-face comedian 
would not say this, so it is changed in 
the Metropolitan version to “Die Frau 
ist schén (the lady is beautiful).” 
When Jonny proposes to Anita in the 
unaltered story, he says? “Warum 
willst denn nicht du meine kraft fiih- 
len? Nur eine Nacht! Du sollst mich 
nicht wiedersehen. Ich kenne ja euch 
Weissen. Erst wehrt ihr euch, dann seid 
ihr begliickt, aud dann adieu! (Why 
will you not feel my strength? Just for 
one night. You shan’t ever see me again. 
I know you white women well. At 
first you resist, then you enjoy yourself 
and then adieu!)” Shades of all the 
departed exalted Knights of the Ku 
Klux Klan! That must be blotted out. 
Besides, this is a white man talking. 
So they substituted (also with an eye 
to the morals of the community at 
large) : “Warum willst du denn nicht 
meine Liebe kennen? Nur einmal, du 
sollst mich nicht wiedersehen. Ich 
kenne ja euch Siingerinnen!” etc. They 
translate it on the English side of the 
libretto: “Why do you refuse to learn 
how much I love you? Be kind just 

once—you'll never see me again. I 








know you singers!” etc. Thus white 
supremacy is saved once more. Again 
when Daniello buys off Jonny from 
Anita, the ‘Ote-toi, negrillon (Get 
away from here, darky)” becomes 
“Ote-toi, sclelerat (villian) !” There 
must be no incongruity because Jonny 
is not a Negro but white. They say to 
themselves over and over again, ‘“‘Jonny 
is not a Negro but white.” Later on 
when Yvonne becomes angry with 
Jonny on account of his indifference 
toward her, she calls him a black devil, 
which is changed merely to “devil” in 
the American libretto. That black- 
face white comedians do not usually 
wear their burnt cork on the streets 
and in the railway stations did not 
bother these translators! 


The grossest stupidity of all the al- 
terations was the one which changed 
the whole sense of the opera. They 
revised the main theme to suit their 
synthetic hero, and thus rendered sense- 
less the whole story. The opera reaches 
a climax when Jonny, having followed 
Anita with the violin home from Paris, 
at last gets it in his hands again and 
leaps upon the piano singing: 

“Jetzt ist der Geige mein, und ich will 
drauf spielen 

Wie Old David einst die Harfe schlug, 

Und preisen Jehovah, der die Men- 
schen schwartz erschuf! 

Mir geh6ért alles was gut ist in der 
Welt, 

Die Alte Welt hat es erzeugt, sie weiss 
damit nichts mehr zu tun. 

Da kommt die Neue Welt iibers Meer 
gefahren mit Glanz, 

Und erbt das Alta Europa durch den 
Tanz.” 

(Now the violin is mine, and I will 
play upon it 

Just as Old David once played upon 
the harp, 

And praise Jehovah, who created men 
black! 

To me belongs all that is good in the 

world; 

The Old world has produced it, but 
she does not know what else to do 
with it. 

Then the New World comes traveling 
across the sea in splendor, 

And takes the heritage of Old Europe 
by means of the dance). 

The statement is almost unbeliev-

above German text: “Und preisen Je- 
hovah, der die Violinen fiir°die Jazz- 
geiger erschuf (And praise Jehovah 
who created violins for jazz-violin- 
ists)!” Comment is unnecessary. 


Now comes the crowning act in this 
whole affair in the hands of the Metro- 
politan management. They rewrote 
the libretto, changed the characters, 
warned the people to buy only the of- 
ficial librettos, et cetera, and then the 
whole Metropolitan caste went on the

audience sat back and laughed when 
the black-face clown leaped about the 


stage and said to Anita, “T know you 

white women, etc.’ They applauded 
when he got on the piano and praised 
Jehovah for creating him black! 

Gatti-Casazza knew his people. How 
he must have smiled to hear the singers 
on the stage shouting across the foot- 
lights all the objectionable lines which 
he had taken such great pains to change 
in the librettos! And the audience 
beamed and clapped in bovine content- 
ment.

ca. The leading newspapers of the 
country report the proceedings. More 
than that, dispatches concerning the 
conference proceedings are even cabled 
to editors in Europe. So the whole 
world is eventually informed of what 
goes on during these sessions. 

Enough has been said to make it 
quite clear that this year’s meeting in 
Cleveland represents an opportunity no 
colored American who can manage to 
attend, should miss. It bids fair to be 
a week that will be long remembered 
by all those who have a part in it. P

tle black lacquer boxes with twelve 
pans of real paint how happy we were. 

We plied the brushes joyously but 
never thought of the interestingly 
varied sources of the colors. There 
was burnt sienna from the soil of 
Siena in Italy; ultramarine, named for 
expensive blue pigments of lapis lazuli; 
sepia from Sir Cuttlefish of the war 
bonnet, gamboge, the yellow pigment 
of Cambodia. So much for our paint 
box. 

And now from Cambodia to Rome 
in the first half of the seventeenth cen- 
tury. Velasquez, court painter to 
Philip IV. of Spain and an artist who 
delights in portraying all sorts of fan- 
tastic dwarfs and jesters such as are 
found in royal households of the time, 
chances to be in the great Italian city. 

The Duke of Olivarez has sent him 
from Madrid to buy pictures for the 
king’s palace. While in Rome the 
Spanish portraitist paints his masterly 
likeness of Innocent X. Here in strik- 
ing contrast he also paints Juan de 
Pareja. Juan de Pareja, Valesquez’s 
Negro slave, grinds the color pigments 
for the celebrated master. 

In the magnificent paintings of Val- 
esquez you see the dark hand of the 


June, 1929 


inspired pigment grinder, who worked 
with such care and skill that today the 
colors of Valesquez are outstanding 
for their freshness and force. The 
pigments of Pareja’s skin were also a 
rich study, Valesquez found, and in 
the portrait of this gifted and beloved 
slave the master brings out the deep 
olive complexion. 

When the portrait was exhibited in 
the Pantheon it was acclaimed such 
work of art that Valesquez in the 
same year, sixteen hundred and fifty, 
was made a Roman academician. As 
to the humble grinder he too became 
a painter. His “Calling of Matthew” 
today hangs in the Prado, the royal 
picture gallery of Madrid. 


Now While the Time is June 


UST let me be a gypsy girl, 
Oh, while the time is June, 
To go beneath those still big trees 
Under the ghost white moon, 
That pours her snowy dust about 
All over path and pike 
The barn yard roof, the spire of church, 
And aspen tree alike. 
She pours the silver dust of night, 
Down from those noiseless lips, 
And now the world is softly white 
For all our gypsy trips.

teacher, but was now too large and be- 
yond the age of the regular attendants 
at the Playground. We saw this same 
white girl very busy, however, with the 
children of all colors. She came to us 
smiling and asked: “Who shall I tell 
Miss wishes to see her?” Our 
names given, the girl rushed off and we 
passed a knowing glance at each other, 
feeling assured that we were at the 
right place because the young white 
girl mentioned our colored friend’s 
name without our having spoken it, as 
yet. 

Our friend and the “teacher” ar- 
rived very soon, now. When we whis- 
pered our dilemma to her we formed a 
triple alliance of hearty laughter be- 
cause the “colored” people did not even 
know her name and also because they 
seemed to be so much in the minority. 

We all recovered. We found good 
seats. We waited quite a while as 
Miss ———————- told us the exercises 
would be delayed as ‘her leading char- 
acters had at the last moment disap- 
pointed her because of a local Sunday 
School picnic. Her substitutes had 
been supplied by children who had vol- 
unteered only that day. All this time,

tots by their sides were streaming into

were not all Baptists. The fatal picnic 
of this all important day was from a 
Baptist Sunday School. Where were 
the A. M. E.’s, the Seventh Day Ad- 
ventists and even the Foot Washers, or 
even the non-church-goers-of-color? A 
conversation on one side: 

“Miss has had such a 
hard time with this closing play. Why, 
my girl had to be the queen and she 
never saw the part until last night.” 
And, “My, but I’m tired. I sat up 
last night making paper dresses for this 
until two o’clock. I would never have 
done it if Miss (the teach- 
er) had not stayed also.” “It’s a real 
wonder she is able to have the Play at 
all with all her disappointments.” 

On the other side of us were some 
other mothers, only a few, however, 
and they talked, too. “Why I heard 
that this girl who is the teacher had to 
go around to the colored churches to 
drum up attendance for the playground 
or it would have been closed.” “Why, 
say, do you know I heard that same 


stuff. I’m thinking something’s wrong 
in Denmark, don’t you think so?” 
Now, you could count the colored 


group on your two hands, and those 
present were only present to find fault. 
But in the midst of the two kinds of 
conversation, our “play was on.” We 
forgot these nearby grumblers to ob- 
serve the passing players of all nations. 
We remembered, only, the group who 
had sat up so late the night before to 
help with the costumes. For three 
Fairy Spirtes, two colored and one 
white, came tripping hand in hand. 
“Old King Cole” a chuckling colored 
lad, truly indicative of the proverbial 
“merry old soul” and the “Queen of 
Hearts” a fair maid of Saxony, hang- 
ing, adoringly, on his arm, were next. 
And then an “interracial” group of the 
whole Mother Goose Family! It took 
little thinking to conclude that this 
Playground would have been closed to 
the community had it not been for the 
white patrons. This despite the fact 
that the fine teacher was a direct rela- 
tive of “Hagar.” In conversation, 
coming home, the “Teacher” who was 
so adored by the one group, and whom 
we, her friends, admired for her win- 
someness and modesty, admitted that 
the Playground would have _ been 
closed had it not been for the regular 
and constant support of the white chil- 
dren and their mothers. Why? 


The Browsing Reader 
(Continued from page 196) 


a Negro already adjudged insane and 
confined in a state asylum for his 
malady is dragged out of his bed and 
lynched for the irresponsible killing of 
a white nurse!” 

The book ends with these words. 





“Meanwhile nothing can contribute 
more toward the permanent establish- 
ment of our national welfare than the 
continued effort to realize for the hum- 
blest in our national life, whether black 
or white, that full measure of justice 
and equal opportunity for which 
America stands as a symbol before all 
the world. To this task thousands of 
the noblest spirits of our country are 
dedicated. It is such as these that make 
one, regardless of race, proud to be an 
American.” 

It is extraordinary that a book like 
this can come out of Tuskegee, Ala- 
bama, even in 1929. 


WHITE’S “ROPE AND 
FAGGOT” 


ALTER WHITE’S “Rope and 

Faggot” should be the last word 
in the lynching contreversy. It is an 
exhaustive and thorough-going work. 
Perhaps, for the ordinary reader it may 
seem to go far afield, but that is be- 
cause such reader does not realize, as 
Mr. White himself did not realize, all 
the implications of lynching. The au- 
thor says in his preface: 

“The present inquiry was begun 
with the intention of treating lynching 
as an isolated phenomenon, but that 
idea was of necessity abandoned before 
the inquiry had proceeded very far. 
The reason for this change is that the 
deeper one inquires into the subject, the 
more one must regard lynching as be- 
ing of only minor importance in itself; 
it is as a symptom of a malodorous eco- 
nomic and social condition that it is 
chiefly significant.” 

There are nine chapters, and a full 
appendix of facts. The First Chapter 
explains the making of the mind of the 
lyncher, and opens with that story of 
the little white girls of nine and ten in 
Florida, who told Mr. White of ‘The 
fun we had burning the Niggers!” 

Chapter Two goes into the facts of 
lynching with gruesome illustrative ex- 
amples. Chapter Three puts the onus 
of lynching directly on religion. “It 
is exceedingly doubtful if lynching 
could possibly exist under any other re- 
ligion than Christianity.” 

Chapter Four takes up the question 
of sex and lynching. ‘The South has 
suffered more than other section be- 
cause of the fact noted in thé preced- 
ing chapter—the preponderance of 
Methodists and Baptists to whom such 
diversions as card-playing, dancing, and 
theatre attendance are forbidden. In 
many parts of the South this circum- 
stance has elevated attendance at 
church, sex escapades, and lynching in- 
to the principal escapes from the grim 
and sordid reality of work. 

“A second reason for over-emphasis 
on sex in the lynching states is that the

creation of the bogy of sex crimes as a 
defence of lynching has made the 
South the terrified victim of the fears 
of its own conjuring.” Chapter Five 
is an interesting exposition of the eco- 
nomic foundations of lynch law, fol- 
lowing out the thesis in italics “Lynch- 
ing has always been the means for pro- 
tection, not of white women, but of 
profits.” 

Chapter Six is a review of the vari- 
ous efforts of scientists and pseudo-sci- 
entists to prove the inferiority of the 
Negro. It is especially interesting in 
the matter of brain weights and psy- 
chological measurements. 

The Seventh Chapter records the 
sordid results of lynching on American 
psychology and in the public opinion 
of the world. Chapter Eight records 
the decline of lynching under the at- 
tacks of the N. A. A. C. P. and other 
agencies. 

Chapter Ten says “Lynching—rule 
by rope and faggot and tarbucket in- 
stead of by orderly and civilized proc- 
esses—has for too long been a curse to 
America and an affront to decency and 
humanity. Against it is needed a 
larger, more active, more valiant, and 
more articulate public opinion to re- 
store sanity, truth, and the reign of 
law. If that organized opinion and ac- 
tion are not forthcoming, sad and ter- 
rible days, not only for the lynching 
states, but for all of America, seem in- 
evitable.” 

This is an excellent and painstaking 
work. It had to be done. It ought to 
be read, but it is not pleasant reading. 





THE ECONOMICS OF. THE 
NEGRO PROBLEM 


COTT NEARING has begun a 

a long awaited task. In a sense, 
his book is an explanation and emphasis 
of the Fifth Chapter of Walter 
White’s volume. But it is, of course, 
more than this. A great and sincere 
apostle of economic revolution has 
turned his mind and pen and drawn the 
attention of the working class of the 
world to the meaning of the Negro in 
America, and it is high time that this 
thing should be done. 

He points out that of the modern 
exploiting empires, America is the only 
one that has a subject class within its 
borders. He proceeds to study that 
subject race, not as a “social problem,” 
but as an oppressed race. He analyzes, 
perhaps not quite as carefully as he 
should, the labor shortage of the 17th 
Century. His explanation of the turn- 
ing from white labor and Indian labor 
to Negro labor is not complete, but the 
fact is clear, and he shows how the 
slave trade was the business of the 
North, while slavery was the business 


June, 1929 


of the South, that both were profitable 
businesses, and flourished until the 
Emancipation Proclamation. 


The Negroes became the raisers of 
four crops of valuable raw materials; 
their increase in population; their dis- 
tribution on the land, was due to eco- 
nomic causes. Thus arose the modern 
black worker in America. ‘The black 
worker of the South does not own his 
own country. He does not even share 
with his Northern fellow-worker the 
illusion of ‘running’ it. He merely 
lives in it, conforms to the social stand- 
ards set by its white masters, and per- 
forms its heaviest labor.” 


Mr. Nearing then studies land own- 
ership and the difficulty and danger 
which Negro owners have. He turns 
to wages and income and shows that 
Southern farm wages and _ incomes 
yield less than subsistance. He de- 
scribes the wretched living conditions 
of the black masses and the denial of 
education. “Little need be said about 
the social position of the Southern 
Negro. He is a field hand. He is a 
servant. Even where he has become a 
skilled mechanic, a business man.or a 
professional man, he is treated as 
though he were still doing menial work. 
The Negro, in the South, is a mem- 
ber of a subject, exploited race, uni- 
versally denied equality with the 
whites. Negro children grow up with 
the fact of their inferiority constantly 
thrown in their faces.” 


What is the reason for this situation? 
It is due to the fact that the centers of 
Southern economic power have been 
and still are in the hands of the whites. 
There are Negro business men, but 
they are not in any basic industry, and 
they usually serve only Negroes. Steel, 
rubber, textiles, tobacco, railroads, pub- 
lic utilities and all the wholesale trade 
are in the hands of the whites; and par- 
ticularly are the whites in control of 
banking. 

Only in the case of land ownership 
have something like 160,000 Negro 
owners crowded in. But even here, 
their hold is precarious. From the 
farm the Negro has turned to industry, 
particularly in the mass migration that 
followed the War. But in industry, 
while receiving better wages and better 
conditions of living, he is still discrim- 
inated against in jobs, in wages, in 
housing, in exclusion from the unions, 
and general discrimination. 

Mob violence, sickness and death, 
and other penalties follow this struggle. 
And it all harks back to the fact that 
the job owners in the United States 
are white men; that Negro ownership 
is confined to farms, homes and per- 
sonal belongings; and that their busi- 
ness activities are restricted to small 
merchandising.

The whites, then, are the exploiters, 
and the blacks are the exploited, and 
the line between the two is the color 
line. This color line the author goes 
on to explain in detail, emphasizing the 
consciousness of blackness, which is im- 
bred in the Negro, and the results of 
segregation and its culmination in lynch 
law. ‘‘Negroes in the important cen- 
ters of American life are a subject 
race.” He describes the black men’s 
fight for freedom; he believes that 
political power offers no escape, and 
that the “runaways” who are seeking 
build a bourgeoisie will not thereby 
escape their racial disabilities. White 
exploiting America is determined to use 
the black worker to offset the demands 
of the white worker, and to form a 
great reservoir of labor. 

How are these economic shackles to 
be broken? To Mr. Nearing this is 
clear. 

“Negro workers must join working- 
class organizations. They must help to 
build trade unions, cooperatives, a poli- 
tical party that represents working- 
class interests. Along no other path 
can the Negro masses hope for eman- 
cipation. 

“White workers must make every 
effort to bring the Negro workers into 
trade unions, into cooperatives, into a 
working-class political organization. 
There is no more vital task before the 
American workers today than that of 
establishing working-class solidarity 


across race lines.” W. E. B. D. 


Postscript 
(Continued from page 204) 
THE OTHER SIDE 


WO white correspondents take 
THE Crisis to task for opinions 
and articles. One gentleman writes: 


“T have been for quite a long time 
an interested reader of THE CRiIsis. 
It has been my privilege, too, for some 
years now, to cooperate with Negro 
physicians in the development of post- 
graduate work, and in the arousing of 
adequate social consciousness among 
Negroes to further the race’s public 
health interests. I have done this pri- 
marily for the pleasure I found in the 
work, and entirely without a sense of 
superiority, or in a manner of patron- 
age. 

“Many a time, however, in reading 
your Crisis, I have found myself most 
severely irritated and profoundly dis- 
couraged by the stupidities voiced 
therein, by the arrogance and ill-con- 
sidered passion published. I have re- 
frained from commenting on it, simply 
because I have felt and feel even now, 
that my comments would be futile and 
ineffectual. 





“Your April number of this year, 
however, contains an article which has 
overcome my inertia, and I must pro- 
test against the publication of such 
cheap, tawdry and insipid stuff as the 
‘Dark Lover’ by Rheba Cain. This 
contribution, most palpably a bid for 
cheap, sensational and free publicity on 
behalf of ‘a book or play the lady has 
written, cannot but expose the Negro 
race to ridicule, and to convince those 
who, like myself, are naturally-born 
friends of the Negro race (as of all 
other races) of the spiritual vacuity of 
certain of your White defenders, whom 
you delight in featuring. 

“T am sure you must be flattered to 
be described as a sophisticated dark 
man, (why not black), in faultless 
evening clothes. Are you really inter- 
ested in achieving the twilight of the 
White race? Are you so un-Christian 
and so mordantly bitter that you would 
like to see the scale reversed, the Negro 
in the position of the stupid superiority 
of the White man, and the White man 
under subjugation of the present-day 
Negro? Are you flattered by the fact 
that jaded Hollywoodites seek to ex- 
ploit the alleged venereal powers of the 
Negro? 

“For myself I loathe this degenerate 
attitude, and I feel that the preach- 
ments of the Nazarene will further the 
interests of the Negro and of all races 
more than such venomous and degener- 
ate outpourings as are embodied in the 
‘Dark Lover’. I am as conscious of 
the White man’s injustices to the 
Negro as a White man can be, and I 
am eager to do all in my power to right 
them, but I Am not interested in revers- 
ing the face on the coin of evil. I have 
no more sympathy for the ambitious 


Negro exploiter than I have for the 
White.” 


The Reverend John W. Day of 
Maine writes as follows: 

“T have just read Mrs. Deland’s 
letter in the last number of THE 
Crisis, and your reply. I am in- 
formed that the representative referred 
to is under indictment for graft and al- 
liance with crime, and it is said that his 
nomination came about through the 
vote of five committee-men, of whom 
he was one, a second and third gambler 
and gangster, and that in Chicago 
there is the kind of Democracy of 
which you speak, and yet crime and 
prostitution are rife to the greatest ex- 
tent. This shows that your statement 
is exactly backward. If we could elect 
men who stand for character, we 
should not only do away with racial 
discriminations, but crime and prosti- 
tution also. 

“T have long been identified with 
your cause, having been President of 


the St. Louis Branch of the N. A. A.

C. P., and of the Urban League up to 
1924, and for twenty-four years was 
actively engaged in behalf of the rights 
and interests of colored citizens. I 
therefore claim a right to assert that 
that you are building your efforts on 
their behalf on a rotten foundation. 
Admitting all the advantages you claim 
for such advocacy as yours, political 
corruption will vitiate it all. What- 
ever such a representative supports will 
be poisoned and discredited by the repu- 
tation you admit he deserves. Your 
defense is itself a self-indictment. To 
sanction such evil for the sake of any 
good that may come is to poison the 
wells from which you must drink. I 
beg you to re-consider, and, in the 
words of Cromwell to the General As- 
sembly of the Kirk of Scotland, ‘I 
beseech you in the bowels of Christ 
think it possible you may be mistaken.’ ” 


THE ECONOMIC PRIZES 
N the March Crisis, 1928, a series of 


Economic Prizes were announced to 
be paid from a Fund contributed by the 
following organizations: the Liberty 
Life Insurance Company, Chicago, the 
National Benefit Life Insurance Com- 
pany, Washington, the North Carolina 
Mutual Life Insurance Company, 
Durham, the Northeastern Life Insur- 
ance Company, Newark, the Southern 
Aid Society, Richmond, the Supreme 
Life and Casualty Company, Colum- 
bus, the Victory Life Insurance Com- 
pany,-Chicago, the Binga State Bank, 
Chicago, the First Standard Bank, 
Louisville, the Peoples’ Finance Cor- 
poration, St. Louis, the Prudential 
Bank, Washington, the St. Luke’s 
Penny Savings Bank, Richmond. 

Twenty-one papers and cartoons 
were submitted for this contest, but 
only six of these fulfilled the require- 
ments “for stories, essays or cartoons 
which will illustrate or study or tell the 
story of the economic development of 
the Negro.” 

These six vary so in their merit that 

we do not think it fair to young writers 
and students to distribute the whole 
of the Fund among them. We are, 
therefore, postponing the awarding of 
a part of the Fund until we receive fur- 
ther contributions. But we are glad 
to announce the following prizes: 
To W.C. Matney of Bluefield, W est 
Virginia, a prize of $100 for an essay 
entitled “Exploitation or Co-opera- 
tion”; to Myra Colson Callis of Tus- 
kegee, Alabama, a prize of $50 for an 
essay entitled ““The Employment Prog- 
ress of Colored Women in the United 
States, 1890-1920”; to Cornelius M. 
Johnson of Chicago, Illinois, a prize of 
$50 for a cartoon which we are pub- 
lishing in the present number of THE 
Crisis.

THE FIFTH PAN-AFRICAN 
CONGRESS 


ETTERS have been sent out dur- 

ing the last few months to a num- 
ber of persons concerning a Fifth Pan- 
African Congress. 

The First Pan-African Congress 
was held in Paris in 1919. The Sec- 
ond, was held in London, Belgium and 
Paris in 1921. The Third, was held 
in London and Lisbon in 1923, and the 
Fourth, in New York in 1927. 

It is proposed that a Fifth Pan- 
African Congress be held, and that for 
the first time the Congress be held 
actually in Africa. If present plans 
mature, this Congress will convene in 
Tunis in December, 1929. The 
President will be M. Gratien Candace, 
French Deputy from Guadeloupe, and 
the Executive Secretary, W. E. Burg- 
hardt Du Bois, the founder of the 
Congresses. The Congress will con- 
vene at the invitation and under the 
auspices of the French Government 
and the French Protectorate of Tuni- 
sia. There will be special Reception 
Committees in Paris, Marseilles, Al- 
giers and Casablanca. 

The object of the Pan-African Con- 
gresses is to bring together for mutual 
acquaintanceship and exchange of 
ideas, the leaders of the various groups 
of persons of Negro descent through- 
out the world. It is desired to pro- 
mote among them sympathy. and 
knowledge and to bring them into help- 
ful co-operation with Colonial Govern- 
ments, and friends of the Negro race. 
It js hoped that out of this plans for 
co-operation and common action will 
gradually arise. 

The Committee for calling the 
Fifth Pan-African Congress and ap- 
pointed by the Fourth Pan-African 
Congress, consists of : 

Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois, U. 
Chairman. 

Mrs. A. W. Hunton, U. S. A. 

Mrs. E. D. Cannaday, U. S. A. 

Bishop R. C. Ransom, U. S. A 

Mr. Raymond Logan, U. S. A. 

Mr. Dantes Bellegarde, Haiti. 

Mr. H. H. Phillips, Jamaica. 

Chief Amoah, III., West Africa. 

Mr. Eugene Corbie, Trinidad, B. 
W. I. ( Deceased.) 

Mr. Huiswold, Dutch Guiana. 

M. Gratien Candace, France. 

Any persons who are interested in 
attending such a Congress are invited 
to write to the Editor of THE Crisis.
