THE Crisis 









By 


HE survey was begun in April, 

1926. It was discontinued dur- 
ing the summer, but was resumed in 
the winter and finished in 1927. It 
was based upon an investigation of 
the facts as disclosed by reports found 
in the offices of the state and county 
superintendents. Personal __ studies 
were made and questionnaires used. 
The author is indebted for help to 
advanced students in the College of 
Education in the State University at 
Langston; to the official staff of the 
State Department of Education, who 
were ready and glad to co-operate; 
to Miss Christburgh, secretary of the 
Negro State Teachers’ Association; to 
W. H. Fort, president of the Negro 
State Principal’s Association; and to 
Roscoe Dungee, editor of the Black 
Dispatch. 


1. The Constitutional and Legal Ba- 


sis of the Negro Common School 
in Oklohoma 


KLAHOMA was settled largely 

by migrants from states in which 
the tradition of the separation of the 
races in educational institutions was 
dominant. As a result, the Indian 
Territory, in its transition to state- 
hood in 1907, engrafted this tradition 
into the constitution of the new state 
of Oklahoma. Previous to this time, 
education in the state had been largely 
a matter of governmental and mission- 
ary enterprise. The largest Negro 
population, previous to statehood, was 
concentrated in the area given over 
to the Creek and Seminole Nations. 
In the early days, there was little if 
any separation of Indians and Negroes 
in these schools and many Negro teach- 
ers had charge of schools under the 
auspices of the two agencies mentioned 
above. Many of these schools had 
an entirely Indian clientele and in 
practically all of them there existed 
co-education of the Indian tribesmen 
and the Negro freedmen of these 
tribes, as they were called. 

In the State Constitutional Con- 
vention, the separation of the races 
in the schools was decreed as follows: 
(Section III, Article XIII, Oklahoma 


Constitution). 


“Sec. 3. Separate schools for white 
and colored children with like accom- 
modation shall be provided by the leg- 
islature and impartially maintained. 
The term ‘colored children’ shall be 
construed to mean children of African 
descent. The term ‘white children’ 
shall include all other children.”

This is the fourth study of the Ne- 
gro common school conducted by THE 
Crisis under the subvention of the 
American Fund for Public Service. 
The full report is the most complete 
and exhaustive of all that have been 
made and consists of nine chapters and 
would, if published in its entirety, oc- 
cupy about seventy full pages of THE 
Crisis. We shall probably be unable 
to publish more than three or four 
chapters unless the school teachers of 
Oklahoma or other interested persons 
come to our assistance. 


aDdM——————————— 





ps. 


ri the legislation passed by the first 
legislature to enable the districts to 
levy money for the support of the 
schools, each district in the state was 
required to maintain two systems of 
schools for the two races. The dis- 
trict system, typical of many older 
states in the East, was adopted by 
Oklahoma. 

The natural result of this enact- 
ment was the same as that witnessed 
in’ practically all Southern © states 
where the burden of maintaining two 
separate systems rests on the tax-pay- 
ers of one unit. The burden of sup- 
porting two equally good systems was 
too great for the local unit. Conse- 
quently, the practice of other South- 
ern states, supporting a fairly good 
system for white children and neglect- 
ing the Negro schools, was being du- 
plicated in the young and progressive 
state of Oklahoma. Particularly did 
the burden become an onerous one 





where, as in such counties as Musko- 
gee, Okmulgee, McCurtain, etc., the 
Negro school population was from 
25% to 40% of the entire enrollment. 

The situation was met rather 
promptly by legislative enactment and 
the third legislature provided the 
much criticized “Separate School Law” 
which states that the local district tax 
shall be used to maintain the school 
attended by the race which has a ma- 
jority in the district, and that the 
minority schools, or separate schools 
as they are called, shall be supported 
by a levy made on all of the taxable 
property in the county. 


HE meaning of this provision may 

be clarified if we quote from the 
law itself: (School Laws of Okla- 
homa, 1921) 


“Section 282. The county separate 
school in each district is hereby de- 
clared to be that school in said district 
of the race having the fewest number 
of children in said school district: pro- 
vided, that the county superintendent 
of public instruction in each county 
shall have authority to designate what 
school or schools in each school dis- 
trict shall be the separate school, and 
which class of children, either white 
or colored, shall have the privilege of 
attending such separate school or 
schools in said school district. Mem- 
bers of the district board shall be of, 
the same race as the children who are 
entitled to attend the school of the dis- 
trict, not the separate school.” 

This added provision plainly means 
that the County Superintendent is the 
real arbiter when the determination

of a school as the Majority or Minor- 
ity school is concerned. In _ other 
words, even though Negroes may out- 
number whites in a certain district, 
the County Superintendent is given 
the power of declaring the Negro 
school the minority school, and the 
white school the majority school. 


The consequences of this are of in- 
terest. Let it be remembered that 
the school designated as the majority 
school is supported by a levy on the 
taxable property of the district; and 
that the school designated as the minor- 
ity or separate school is supported out 
of a general tax levy on county-wide 
property. It is evident that in a case 
where the assessed valuation of a dis- 
trict might supply more funds than 
can be obtained from the county fund, 
the arbitrary power vested in the hands 
of the county superintendent might be 
used to the disadvantage of either 
group. This power has been applied, 
of course, only in depriving Negro 
majority schools of their privilege in 
receiving the tax funds from their ma- 
jority district. 


HIS phase of the law, so seem- 

ingly inconsistent, has been tested 
and upheld in a decision of the State 
Supreme Court. In upholding this 
law, however, the Court handed down 
the opinion that the county must as- 
sure equal educational facilities to both 
races if such a change is made. (See 
Jumper vs. Lyles, 77 Okla. 57; also 
State ex rel Gumm vs. Albritton, 98 
Okla. 158, 224 Pac. 511). The lat- 
ter decision states that the county su- 
perintendent has the right to desig- 
nate which school shall be the sepa- 
rate school in any district under his 
supervision. “The designation of a 
separate school when the race affected 
has a majority of the population in 
such a district is not in violation of 
the Fourteenth Amendment when no 
discrimination is made regarding edu- 
cational facilities.’ 


The objections to this statute may 
be conlensed into two main criticisms: 
(1), the transference of support from 
the district to the county may result 
in a financial inequality. It would 
mean that the Negro tax-payers, who 
were in the majority, would be taxed 
both for the support of the local white 
school, if it was designated as the ma- 
jority school and for the support of 
the general county fund for separate 


schools, as well. 


HE second objection (2) is that 
of political fairness. The district

cisions Relating to Schools in Okla- 
homa, p. 18, s. 178. 


114 





system is, of course, the heir of all of 
the principles of local self government 
on which, as a matter of fact, it was 
first proposed as a unit of educational 
control in this country. Negro citi- 
zens in majority school districts con- 
stitute the members of the school 
boards, hire the teacher and in other 
ways perform all of the function of 
this democratic, self governing unit. 
When a county superintendent desig- 
nates the white minority school as the 
majority school and the Negro major- 
ity school as the separate school, by 
reason of his arbitrary power referred 
to above, he at once transfers all of 
the administrative functions formerly 
vested in the local district to his own 
immediate supervision and control. 

The first objection is probably of 
little weight. As will be indicated 
in the future course of this survey, 
the separate school does not suffer from 
lack of funds when compared with 
the relative expenditures in district or 
majority schools. 


The second is more serious in that 
the power vested in the county super- 
intendent is often arbitrarily exercised 
for purely political reasons. It en- 
ables an unscrupulous superintendent 
to go over the heads of the local pa- 
trons of the school and manipulate the 
machinery of administration for the 
perpetuation of a personal political 
machine. It is easy to see that county 
supervision, with its wider vision and 
more equable distribution of funds, 
may prove much more scientific from 
the standpoint of modern educational 
supervision than the local district unit 
with its bungling methods and petty 
political jealousies. However, the 
county administrative unit, wherever 
it has been adopted, has been safe- 
guarded by the general direction of 
an elected county board of education, 


and the- selection of professionally 


trained administrators for the carry- 
ing on of the business of the schools. 
Without these safeguards, which are 
not enjoyed in Oklahoma, the Negro 
school under county is a potential vic- 
tim of all the evils consequent to such 
a condition. 


HE remedy would seem to lie in 

an appeal to the weapons of judi- 
cial procedure which are at the dis- 
posal of any citizen of the state. Even 
though the administrative power is 
removed to the county seat, the Negro 
citizen should have little care for the 
mere gesture, so long as an equality in 
school facilities is maintained. As a 
matter of fact, Oklahoma is tending 
today away from the uneconomic dis- 
trict system to the county unit for 
taxation and administration of schools. 
Eternal vigilance is here, as elsewhere, 
the price of equal accommodations. 


And the courts have been remark. 
ably steadfast in insisting that equal 
accommodations be given schools for 
the two races. Based on the constity- 
tional items italicized in the quotation 
from Section 3 appearing above, a de- 
cision was rendered in favor of the 
Board of Education of the City of 
Guthrie, which was suing the Excise 
Board of Logan County on the 
grounds that the Excise Board had 
not included in the County Budget a 
large enough levy to afford adequate 
school facilities for the Negro chil- 
dren. In finding for the plaintiff, the 
Court emphasized the fact that the 
Constitution makes it the duty of the 
Legislature to provide equal and im- 
partial provisions for all children of 
the state, regardless of color. (Board 
of Education of Guthrie vs. Excise 
Board Logan County, 206 Pac. 517), 


T is evident from the above discus- 
| sion that the administrative con- 
trol of most of the Negro schools in 
Oklahoma is vested in the office of 
the County Superintendent of Public 
Instruction; and, in those few cases 
where the Negro school is still desig- 
nated as the Majority school, that it 
is controlled by regularly elected citi- 
zens of the district to the District 
School Board. A peculiar anomaly 
has grown up, however, as a result 
of-the practice of allowing the city 
administrative systems to operate the 
Negro schools where a large white 
independent district exists. This 
means that the county furnishes the 
money in the larger cities, but the 
city furnishes the administrative and 
supervisory staff which directs the Ne- 
gro schools. This is at best a clumsy 
device, although, without doubt, the 
best that could be hit upon in the 
light of present legislative enactments. 
It has resulted practically in the con- 
centration of county funds upon the 
urban Negro schools, while, in many 
instances, the Negro children of the 
rural districts suffer from a lack of 
funds. The ideal, of course, would 
be the distribution of the funds avail- 
able in such a fashion that the chil- 
dren in the rural districts would bene- 
fit as largely as the children in the 
urban areas. The fact that this is not 
done is simply a failure on the part 
of county officials to see to the equitable 
distribution of these funds. 


2.The Financing of Negro Schools 


E have pointed out the fact that 

in the beginning of the period 
of statehood, each district was faced 
with the problem of supporting Negro 
schools on the basis of taxation within 
the district. When the two systems 
were separated as administrative and 
financial units, we have shown how

the county became the taxing unit for 
the Separate schools, which, in most 
instances, were Negro schools and that 
the district became the taxing unit for 
the Majority schools, which, corre- 
spondingly, were in most instances the 
white schools. 

The districts were allowed to tax 
all property within their borders by 
means of a levy up to fifteen mills on 
each assessed dollar of valuation. In 
addition to this, the districts were to 
receive an apportionment from the 
state school fund in proportion to their 
ability and effort to support public 
education and this state fund was ap- 
portioned to the districts. As these 
districts are units based on the white 
school population, the result is that 
the state funds are apportioned to the 
white schools principally. 

In the measures passed by the Third 
Legislature, as noted above, establish- 
ing distinct systems for the races, the 
counties were allowed to levy a tax 
of one mill on all assessed valuation 
in the county for the support of the 
Separate schools. We have already 
indicated that the Separate school, 
while not necessarily a Negro school, 
is so in most instances. This legisla- 
tion, then, meant that Negro educa- 
tion was to be supported by means of 
this one mill levy alone, while the 
white schools or district schools were 
to be supported by a levy of fifteen 
mills on the property within the dis- 
trict. In addition, support of the 
district schools was to be obtained from 
the apportionment of state funds as 
outlined above. 


T soon became apparent that the 

one mill levy limitation would seri- 
ously handicap the Negro schools. The 
condition led to such an open inequal- 
ity of educational opportunity that 
agitation looking toward a change in 
the law, with an upward extension 
of the taxing levy limit, was inaugu- 
rated and was successful in raising 
the levy which counties might levy for 
the support of their Negro schools to 
two mills. This legislation was passed 


in 1921. 


The counties are bound under con- 
stitutional provisions not to exceed 
eight mills in their taxing budgets for 
the running of county affairs. Even 
the two mill levy has proven itself 
insufficient, in many instances, to meet 
the requirements of the state constitu- 
tion, which, as we have emphasized 
above, recognizes racial separation in 
fact and theory, but insists upon 
equality of opportunity and facilities 
for education. The Supreme Court 
has therefore ruled in two instances 
that the legal limit is not binding upon 
counties, if the demands of the case 
necessitate an increased expenditure 


April, 1928 


for the equalization of educational op- 
portunity for Negroes. 

The most important ruling on this 
vital issue was handed down in the 
case brought by the Oklahoma News 
Company vs. Ryan, 224 Pac. 969. Its 
principal considerations may be sum- 
marized as follows: 


o%: For maintaining separate 
schools, all statutory limitations are 
removed up to the constitutional limit 
of eight mills for county purposes, 
and, if necessary, an additional: two 
mills may be levied for this purpose. 

2. Counties having a population of 
not less than 52,000 may levy not 
more than one-half mill to provide for 
a home for dependent boys.’ ; 


HIS - decision means that the 
counties are obliged, through 
their budget making machinery (the 
county excise board), to provide equal 
facilities for Negro children even if 
to do so means exceeding the eight 
mills provided for in the State Con- 
stitution for general purposes; and 
that the two mill levy-limit is not 
binding in the financing of the Negro 
schools. In other words, if a county, 
by reason of low assessed valuation, 
coupled with a large Negro school 
population, is unable to supply for its 
Negro school patrons, educational facil- 
ities equal to those provided by other 
means for the white school popula- 
tion, through the levying of a special 
two mill levy for separate schools, 
then that county is privileged to levy 
as much as ten mills for general county 
purposes and devote whatever share 
of the ten mills as is necessary to Ne- 
gro education. 


However, as will be pointed out in 
that section of this survey devoted to 
finances and expenditures, even this 
additional levy will not be sufficient 
to support Negro schools on the same 
basis which is characteristic of white 
schools. In other words, the county 
is now unable to furnish sufficient 
funds for this purpose. The unit has 
been outgrown as educational stand- 
ards of maintenance have been raised. 
The next logical step is the provision 
of a larger wunit—presumably the 
state. This is the only sure means by 
which Negro education can be re- 
moved from the unsatisfactory financ- 
ing prevailing in certain counties 
where the adequate support of Negro 
education by the county alone would 
provide a most intolerable burden. 

There are other means through 
which the problem could be attacked,

Education). 


though none but the one just men- 
tioned seems to afford a final solu- 
tion. It has been the general practice 
to budget Negro education along with 
other county expenditures within the 
eight mill limit. This means that 
the Negro schools—the separate school 
fund—are obliged to compete with the 
highway repair and building budgets, 
the budget for general county admin- 
istrative officers, and whatever othe 
expenditures are made in running the 
business of the county. As a result, 
the budget for Negro schools has been, 
in all too many instances, sacrificed to 
the demands of these other depart- 
mental requirements. We shall seek 
to indicate further on that many coun- 
ties are not doing as much as they 
might. 

The Negro schools also receive ap- 
portionments from the state funds 
which have recently been appropriated 
under the name of the “Weak School” 
fund. This has amounted recently to 
a large sum of money, and is sup- 
posedly for the purpose of furnishing 
impartial allotments of funds to each 
poor district where the term would 
otherwise have been shortened due to 
inadequate local resources. 


T is to be regretted that Negro edu- 

cators have not understood the law, 
nor taken advantage of the opportu- 
nity which these strong opinions 
of the Supreme Court lay open. In 
the opinion of competent legal au- 
thorities consulted by the writer, 
the tax-paying citizens who are cogni- 
zant of unequal advantages, should 
bring actions in the civil courts seek- 
ing to force the county excise board 
to levy sufficient taxes, within the ten 
mill limit, of course, as indicated 
abeve, sufficient to bring the expendi- 
tures for Negro education on a parity 
with those for white education in the 
same communities. That such action 
has a very reasonable possibility of 
success is to be seen in the decisions 
quoted above and occurring in the ap- 
pendix to this chapter. We may re- 
fer again at this time to the case re- 
ferred to above, viz., Board of Edu- 
cation of Guthrie vs. Excise Board 
Logan County, 206 Pac. 517: “The 
Constitution makes it the duty of the 
Legislature to provide equal and im- 
partial provisions for all children of 
the state”. The legislature has pro- 
vided certain machinery in this en- 
abling legislation; and it becomes, per- 
force, the duty of the county unit to 
carry out the essential phases of the 
demand. 


In many instances, of course, it 
would not be necessary for the county 
to levy even one mill for Negro edu- 
cation, as the Negro population in 62 
of the 77 counties in the state is less

than ten per cent. of the total. In 
many of these counties, the Negro 
population is so small as to be negli- 
gible, so far as educational expendi- 
tures are concerned. It is in the fif- 
teen counties where the Negro popu- 
lation ranges from ten to forty per 
cent. of the total that the problem of 
financial support becomes acute.

T will be noted that the figures for 

the last four years show a slight 
decrease. There is evidence to the ef- 
fect that the Negro population. of 
Oklahoma is decreasing, as there are 
definite migratory tendencies to the 
North and Southwest, especially to 
the developing cotton lands of New 
Mexico and Arizona. The fact that 
the “common” school enrollment 


shows a disproportionate increase in’ 


the face of this. fact is probably due 
to the fact that County superinten- 
dents in some cases reported pupils in 
independent districts (supported by 
the County) as enrolled in the “com- 
mon schools”, which designation in the 
above table is meant to include pupils 
in rural districts as opposed to pupils 
enrolled in independent districts. If 
anything, one should look for a de- 
crease in the rural district enrollment, 
and there probably has been, while 
one may with’ assurance- state that 
there has been a very slight increase 
in the enrollment of the larger urban 
areas. The school enumeration as of 
Jan. 15, 1926, gave 26,102 males, and 
26,161 females, as within the ages of 


116 


5-21, all of which are included in the 
school enumeration. If we are to re- 
duce this total of 52,263 to figures 
which will represent the total number 
of scholastics between the ages of 6-18, 
multiplying by the factor .8667, we 
have a total of only 45,296. This, 
of course, is impossible, as we have 
already indicated that over 48,000 pu- 
pils were actually enrolled in the 
schools of Oklahoma for Negroes dur- 
ing the year 1925-’26. The discrep- 
ancy can be explained: (1), on the ba- 
sis of an inaccurate enumeration; (2), 
on the basis of an enumeration of in- 
dividuals within the scholastic age 
limits, rather than from the ages as 
indicated above. However, the law 
governing the compilation of enumera- 
tion statistics specifically states that 
returns are to be made in terms of the 
ages 5-21. In view of these considera- 
tions, one seems justified in believing 
that there is a much larger number of 
scholastics than the reduction of enu- 
meration figures would suggest. 


N inspection of the reports of 

County superintendents shows a 
wide variation in percentages of at- 
tendance as calculated in these reports. 
In many instances it is difficult to de- 
termine just what method was used 
in reaching the final percentages there 
reported. For the purpose of this re- 
port, it was considered a_ correct 
method of procedure to determine: (a), 
the total number of pupils enrolled in 
a given system; and (b), the average 
daily attendance in the schools of this 
system. The percentages of attend- 
ance were then estimated by noting 
what percentage of the total enroll- 
ment was represented by the average 
daily attendance. The resulting to- 
tals gave results which were in many 
instances much lower than those given 
in the official reports of the county 
superintendents. The deviations are 
doubtless due to different methods of 
calculating attendance percentages, al- 
though they are without doubt con- 
tributed to by actual arithmetical 
lapses from accuracy.

and average daily attendance for the

HE average for the rural districts 

is 54%. This is 4% lower than 
for the same figure of the year 1922- 
23. This would indicate that the 
wretched condition of affairs, so far 
as school attendance is _ concerned, 
which was revealed by the state sur- 
vey of 1921 is still operative, and, 
as a matter of fact, that there is an 
actual decline in this phase of the eff- 
ciency of the school. The average 
for the urban districts is 66%. The 
total for the state is 63% in average 
daily attendance, which is the same 
as that reported for the Negro schools 
in the report of 1923. These data 
would indicate that, while the urban 
school population is attending school 
more regularly, the rural school popu- 
lation is declining in regularity of 
school attendance. This is but an- 
other indication that the divided ses- 
sion plan, referred to more extensively 
under the heading of “The Efficiency 
of the Schools”, is wreaking havoc 
with the efficiency of the rural school. 

The State School Report for the 
year 1923 gives an interesting sum- 
mary of the condition implied above. 
The figures quoted refer to the white 
school attendance statistics. The re- 
port says in part: 

“In ability to hold the pupils after 
they enroll the common schools make 
a poor showing in comparison with 
the independent districts. The aver- 
age daily attendance of the common 
school students, 215,151 is only 59.5% 
of the number enrolled, while the aver- 
age daily attendance in the indepen- 
dent districts, 225,885, is 76% of the

Matthew Anderson 


With a Eulogy by DR. FRANCIS GRIMKE 


HE late Matthew Anderson, son 
T of Mary and Timothy Ander- 
son, was born in Greencastle, Pa., 
January 25, 1848, and died of double 
pneumonia, after a brief illness of two 
days, January 11, 1928. At the time 
of his death he was the last surviving 
member of a family of fourteen chil- 
dren. 

By his own struggles and sacrifices 
he was educated at Iberia, Oberlin 
College, Princeton Seminary and Yale 
University. He was one of the earli- 
est colored graduates of Princeton 
Seminary. 

He came to Philadelphia in 1879, 
penniless. He was on his way to take 
up work in the South, but stopping 
here he met the late Dr. John B. 
Reeve, who suggested that he remain 
here and develop the Gloucester Mis- 
sion in the Northern part of Phila- 
delphia. 

Taking charge of the Gloucester 
Mission on Fairmount Avenue, he 
soon developed a small body of fol- 
lowers to the point where larger quar- 
ters became necessary. With charac- 
teristic foresight and insistence, he ob- 
tained possession of the very valuable 
site where the present Berean Church 
is located. It was on this spot that 
he reared one of the most unique in- 
stitutions, religious and educational, to 
be found anywhere in the United 
States. 

Rev. Anderson was twice married, 
first to Doctor Caroline V., the daugh- 
ter of the late William Still. She 
died in 1919. Later he was married 
to Miss Blanche Williams who sur- 
vives him. He is survived also by 
two daughters, the issue of his first 
marriage, two nieces, other relatives 
and a host of friends. 

Dr. Anderson was more than a min- 
ister, he was also a far seeing Social 
Worker and Community builder. He 
founded the Berean Building and Loan 
Association in 1888, which is now one 
of the largest and strongest Associa- 
tions in the United States. In 1889 
he founded the Berean Manual Train- 
ing and Industrial School, which from 
a small beginning has grown rapidly, 
and is typical of a kind of education 
very much needed in many sections of 
our country, North and South. His 
last contribution to the Berean Enter- 
prise was the planning for the estab- 
lishmerit of a Penny Savings Bank. 
With prophetic vision he said: “This 
will be my last contribution to the 
Berean Enterprise.” 


Dr. Francis J. Grimké of Wash- 
April, 1928 





The Late Dr. Matthew Anderson 


ington, the well-known pastor of the 
15th Street Presbyterian Church, 
writes: 


HAVE just received a telegram an- 

nouncing the death of the Rev. 
Matthew Anderson of Philadelphia. 
It was a great shock to me, not having 
even heard that he was sick. We have 
been close friends for years. We were 
in Princeton Theological Seminary to- 


gether—he having graduated a year 
ahead of me in 1877. He was one of 
the biggest, most generous hearted fel- 
lows I ever knew. He was the soul 
of generosity, of kindness, of hospital- 
ity. There wasn’t anything that he 
wouldn’t do for you, and gladly if it 
were in his power. There was noth- 
ing that he had that was too good for 
his friends, nothing that lay within

THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT | 
iinet ili iealinteen enema 


— 








LITTLE thing like history or 

the world’s literature hardly 
bothers the gentlemen determined to 
keep the white race “pure”. Nor are 
they deterred in their noble efforts by 
any thought of several million per- 
sons of “mixed” ancestry in the 
United States alone. They still in- 
sist that marriages between persons of 
Caucasian and those of African an- 
cestry must be prohibited by law. In 
fact, they become’ so warmed to their 
chivalrous task’ that the very organ- 
ization whose grand dragon is serving 
a life sentence for murder of a young 
woman in Indiana, starts burning fiery 
crosses. — 

The most recent flurry over inter- 
marriage occurred in the hitherto un- 
known town of Rockville, Connec- 
ticut. The town was first heard of 
when newspapers reported that a 
white girl wanted to marry a Negro 
who had served his country in ‘the 
United States Navy; and that Christ’s 
‘vicars on earth, the clergymen of 
Rockville, for the most part declined 
to perform the ceremony of marriage 
for these two people, because of the 
difference in race color and previous 
condition of servitude. 

Among those who are reported to 
have refused to-perform the marriage 
ceremony, were the Rev. George S. 
Brooks, of the local Congregational 
Church. The Rev. H. B. Olmstead, 
rector of the Episcopal Church is 
quoted by the New York World as 
having said: “There ought to be a 
law against it”. The only clergyman 
in Rockville, reported by the press to 
have beén willing to perform the cere- 
mony, was the Rev. John S. Buck- 
mann of the First Evangelical Lu- 
theran Church. 


OW the N. A. A. C. P. reads 

the newspapers. And it stepped 
into the situation to the extent of 
pointing out a few pertinent facts to 
Connecticut editors. One of the N. 
A. A. C. P. letters, published by the 
Waterbury, Connecticut, Republican, 
read as follows: 


Not content with declining to perform 
the marriage ceremony for two persons 
in Rockville, Connecticut, on the ground 
that one of them was a Negro, an Epis- 
copalian clergyman, one of several who 
declined his services, announced himself 
as favoring a law prohibiting intermar- 
riage between persons of white and 
Negro ancestry. 

It seems a little strange that minis- 
ters of the gospel should on grounds of 


118 





oa wid>e- 


Race Intermarriage 
rent 





> 


their personal prejudice decline to unite 
two persons in marriage. But what 
seems still stranger is that a Christian 
minister should advocate anti-intermar- 
riage law in the North. This measure, 
as is well known, is one of the pet proj- 
ects of the now-discredited Ku Klux 
Klan. 

These laws are a relic of slave cul- 
ture, which deprived colored women of 
all legal redress, though it did not pre- 
vent race mixture. The National Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Colored 
People does not advocate intermarriage 
between white and colored persons. But 
it opposes any such law as is suggested 
by the Rockville clergyman. Public sen- 
timent in the North does not sanction 
discrimination by law, the enactment of 
measures setting the stigma of inferior- 
ity upon an entire race, the encouraging 
of illicit relations by making recourse to 
legal matrimony impossible. 


OT only did the editor of the 
Waterbury Republican publish 
this letter. He wrote an editorial 
about it. He called the proposed mar- 
riage “unfortunate”, and deplored it. 

“But,” he continued, “much to be 
deplored were the manifestations of 
active antagonism to the union in- 
dulged in by the Rockville townspeo- 
ple. Particularly unfortunate was the 
burning of a cross on a nearby hill- 
side. ‘The effect of this implied threat, 
and the other evidences of angry feel- 
ing, was naturally to confirm the cou- 
ple in their determination to marry. 
One is left wondering if they had any 
of the wise and sympathetic counse! 
that might have deterred them from 
taking the step they did. 

“In this connection we agree with 
the opinions expressed in a letter, 
printed elsewhere on this page, from 
James Weldon Johnson, Secretary of 
the National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People. Con- 
necticut does not need a law against 
intermarriage of whites and Negroes, 
if for no other reason than the fact 
that the proportion of mulattoes in 
the total Negro population of the 
state dropped from 24.7 per cent in 
1910 to 11.6 per cent in 1920. Mis- 
cegenation is on the decline here as it 
is in the nation at large.” 


NOWING the casual way in 
which census takers determine 
who is a “pure” Negro and who is a 


mulatto, the N. A. A. C. P. wonders 


if the statistics of the editor of the 
Waterbury Republican are not open 
to question. And, decline of mulat. 
toes in the Negro population of Cop. 
necticut hardly furnishes the most re. 
splendent ground for opposition to an 
inter-marriage law, which has wel] 
been called a magna charta of illegi- 
timacy, concubinage and _ bastardy, 
But we should be grateful for any edi- 
tor who, on any ground, maintains 
that marriage is a private matter not 
to be invaded with the rancors of 
ignorant and prejudiced persons, 

I use that word “ignorant’’ advis- 
edly. The National Office, during 
the course of the excitement, but after 
the marriage had taken place, received 
a letter from Rev. George S. Brookes, 
pastor of the Union Congregational 
Church, of Rockville, Connecticut. In 
this letter, the Rev. Mr. Brookes 
asked a number of questions. It is 
not necessary to repeat all his ques- 
tions. One of them is quite enough 
to illustrate the mentality which is 
ready to devote itself to keeping the 
white race pure. I quote the ques- 
tion: 

“Am I right in speaking of the 
number of Negroes in the country as 
12,000,000? How many of this num- 
ber are Caucasians? Is a Caucasian 
always the product of black and 
white, or could he be the result of a 
union of black and some other race?” 

No. I’m not joking. I did not in- 
vent that question. I merely copied 
it out of the letter sent to the National 
Office of the N. A. A. C. P. by the 
Rev. George S. Brookes, pastor of the 
Union Congregational Church of 
Rockville, Connecticut.

AGAIN: “MONEY”! 

HAT the Association is unable to 

help more people, that it must 
allow moving appeals to go unassisted, 
rests entirely with the colored people of 
the United States. The Association can 
do as much work as there is money to 
pay for. Had there been no legal de- 
fense fund, it could not have stepped 
into the Sweet case and rescued eleven 
people from imminent menace of life 
imprisonment. Its victories before the 
Supreme Court, its rescue of the im- 
prisoned 24th Infantrymen and of the 
Arkansas colored farmers, its segre- 
gation and White Primary victories, 
safeguarding fundamental citizenship 
rights of all colored people were made 
possible by cash on hand.

Carnival at Trinidad 
By CLEMENT WOOD 
FE. 
MPTY all of history’s pages— 
Tumble out of their musty cages 
Conquistadores and Moslem mages, 
Doubleted pages, swami sages, 
Pirates, red with their last outrages, 
The brilliant scum of all the ages— 
And the whole would be what last night 
we had 


In the carnival at Trinidad. 


Il. 
HE masked hour—the 


eon— 

The mumming of the Caribbean, 

When the hidden things that we long 
to be 

Creep from their caged mystery 

Creep, and for a night and a night 

Are all that faces another’s sight... . 

The dignified judge, sedate and sober 

As a Connecticut October 

Is Blackbeard’s self, with 
gore 

That reddens the pale dancing floor; 

The maiden, whose name is that of a 
nun, 

Is a scarlet Lilith from Babylon; 

The roisterer droops as a cowled priest, 

The clerk is a sultan from the East, 

Whirling a fancy-welded sword 

Like a very Khan of the Golden Horde; 

Scores of sheiks and Pierrots, 

Hareem houris with nervous toes, 

Hornpiping tars, and many a devil 

To leer and chuckle over the revel! 

The purring tunes and the dimming 
lights, 

And the furtive 
sweets. .. . 


III. 


HE lorries, that all day have drawn 
The revellers, circling on and on 
Around the vast windy savannah 
Through coiling whirling paper liana 
And shower of confetti, disgorge glad 
freight 
To riot and rolic and celebrate— 
—And what? That one day hence’ will 
see 
Forty days’ penance for agony? 
That Rome went mad in the pandering 
spring, 
And the Celt became a wild thing 
en winter broke? Oh, these, and 
more, 
Cemented under the mind’s floor 
In forgetfulness. But there are those

Risk no view of their 
dreams. ... 

The masked hour—the false face eon— 

Toward a dark heaven by the Carib- 
bean. ... 

Most of their masks, you note, are 
white: 

The scorned and slighted hiding the 
slight— 

The subject 
might— 

Night as light... . 

They mince along like Nordic on pa- 
rade, 

But the chants they choral, the wild cas- 
cade 

Of jungle music, no white could know: 

All Negro: 

Melodies a Congo nightingale trills 

Over heaven’s dark hills. .. . 

Men as women, and women as men 

In some rapt mixture evoked again; 

And to them Carnival has two delights— 

Love—sex—mating; and to hell with 
the whites.

OT all are white masks: there are 
Caribs here, 


Red and terrible, with bow, hatchet, 
spear, 

Or the knife of the red sacrifice 

For red bliss; 

There are devils with black and horrid 
faces, 

Muttering against those in high places, 

Whispering of prone disgraces, 

And an end to sneery superior races; 

There are medicine men from the Span- 
ish Main, 

With spells to blister the foe with pain, 

Body, soul, brain; 

There are obi-men—voodoo mages— 

Papaloi, mamaloi, ouanga sages 

With devils ready to serve, in cages 

Sewn under patches of cloth, with spells 

To work unholy miracles 

Until to the sacrifice is borne 

The trapped goat without a horn, 

The white goat. ... Nothing kind 

Moving in masked face and mind, 

But a hurricane and a whirlwind 

‘)f hatred and anger and utter passion 

Against the lords of oppression.

HE false face eon? ‘The masked 
hour? 
Not this: long years with others in

Over a smiling uncomplaining race— 

These have seen the mask in place. 

Now it is dropped and utterly gone: 

The soul behind strides proudly on. 

Not cringing cowards welcoming blows, 

These Negroes: 

Battering, pounding, crushing might 

Has throned the white, 

Has given a darker world in sway, 

As prey— 

There will come a day 

(So mutter and mumble and chant and 
shriek 

These tongues for a weak no longer 
week) 

A day when the pallor will be accurst, 

And the pretty pale face bubble burst, 

And the last shall be first— 

Not in a misty heaven—but on earth, 

That all of worth: 

When all of the white supremacy 

Will crumble like sand in a floodtide 
sea; 

And the sun will be hid, that vaster 
suns 

May shine from darker oblivions. 

A little longer—no man knows when: 

What is time in the life of men? 

A little longer—and then the doom, 

One without, one within, the gloom, 

One without, one within, the tomb.

HOCOLATE rabbits, rabbits of 

pulp and plaster of Paris sud- 
denly appear in nests of paper grass, 
as though they were returning this 
Easter season from snug little burrows 
as real rabbits come in springtime from 
winter hiding places. 

The real rabbits burrow deep for 
severe weather, and barely cover them- 
selves for a mild winter. They do 
not build with the care of Friend Mole 
who makes neat tunnels and a dome 
for his hiding place. Indeed it is 
easy enough for hungry weasels and 
skunks to reach Cottontail, for there 
is but one entry to his burrow. And 
when he goes out for a little winter 
gambol, here comes some mischievous 
dog to spoil the fun. One often finds 
in the snow footprints of Cottontail 
shadowed with the marks of a pur- 
suer’s feet. And so cheery Bunny is 
not without his hardships, though the 
drawings of him surrounded with gor- 
geous eggs on the Easter cards give 
one a pleasant greeting. 


The Elm Tree 
"TALL elm tree boughs, I love to watch 


you swing and sway, 
Swing and sway 
In the winds of early April on a bluish 
day 
skies are 
white, 
Airy-light, 
And moving like some boundless sea 
Over me. 


When altogether blue and 


I stand with back against your great 
brown trunk 

And look and look 

Through all your budding boughs 

Peppered with countless dusky 
strange and small : 

That make the rocking sprays so soft 
and airy, 

Like seaweed floating, floating on billows 
of the sky, 

Or like the hair of some gypsy fairy 

She has let fly.

Of life anew and blossoming,

Here are his footprints in the snow! 
Where, tell me, was he going?

66 QO you mind my looking at 
you?” chirped Phoebe. “You 

seem to.” 

a muffled 

But I was 

attractive 


Russet answered with 
croak, “‘Not particularly. 
wondering what was so 
about me.” 

“Attractive?” blurted out Phoebe. 
“You're just the other way. First | 
thought you were a little knot of bark. 
Then I decided you must be a terrible 
looking stone. Then all at once I re- 
membered that you could be a Toad. 
I’ve heard Toads described as hideous 
creatures.” 

“Thank you,” grunted Russet with- 
cut looking anywhere. “I am a Toad, 
as were my parents before me, all 
Toads.” 

“And I’m wondering,” Phoebe 
jumped about on the new grass, “how 
in the world you spend your winters, 
where you go. One must be so 
sprightly to venture on autumn trips. 
When did you come back from Mex- 
ico?” 

“T haven’t been to Mexico,” dryly. 

“Haven’t been to Mexico?” piped 
Phoebe pausing in her restless flut- 
tering about to gaze into the drowsy 
eyes of Russet. ‘“‘Why how in the 
world have you stood the winters?” 

“The winters,’ mumbled Russet 
complacently, “haven’t bothered me. 
1 sleep. Splendidly. Never better 
than in winter. My heart goes to 
sleep. My blood gets as cold as the 
coldest weather. And there I am in 
a nice little sand cubby-hole out of 


sight, out of the way to wait for warm 
weather when I can start to flying,” 

“Flying?” shrieked Phoebe. “Why, 
where are your wings?” 

“I don’t actually mean flying, my 
friend. I mean catching flies. Yoy 
know, when people go for fish they 
call that fishing. And so then, when 
1 go after flies, why shouldn’t I say 
‘flying’ ?” 

“After flies ?”’ cried Phoebe who had 
started away. ‘Do you eat flies too? 
Why so do the Phoebes and the Least 
Flycatchers. Do you know the Least 
Flycatchers ?” 

“Not particularly,” Russet grunted, 
now wearied by Phoebe’s penetrating 
voice. _He sat like a lifeless thing at 
the foot of the beech. ‘Least Fly- 
catchers like Phoebes are not impres- 


sive to look upon, perhaps. But par- 
don me.” 
“T’ll have to,” gasped Phoebe, 


“since you and I have fly eating tastes 
in common. How do you get your 
flies? Tell me, and I’ll tell you my 
method.” 

“T use a tongue instead of a 
method,” Russet said shortly. ‘‘So,” 
And out shot his tongue in a flash. 
It was fastened to the front of his 
mouth and not swung from the back 
like Phoebe’s. 

“Gracious!” She started. “You 
catch them on that dreadful tongue? 
How do they stay?” 

“My tongue has something on it to 
which they stick. They are different 
from Phoebes. Phoebes stick of their 
own accord. Good day.” And Rus- 
set hobbled off into the weeds. 


Rob Red Ear 
OB RED EAR was a bunny 


That never ran away. 
You'll think this rather funny, 
But Red Ear had to stay. 
His legs were made together tight. 
His staring eyes were minus sight. 
He could not use his chubby feet 
Of chocolate, all rich and sweet, 
And so he simply had to stay 
Till some one ate him Easter Day.

Bathesda of Sinners Run 


A Story By MAUDE IRWIN OWENS 


ATHESDA was the mulatto de- 
B scendent of seven generations of 
slaves. Her mother was a devout 
Christian with the gift of healing in 
her hands; but her Indian father 
scoffed at all religion. Bathesda grew 
up apart from the other colored folk 
refusing to marry and devoting her 
time to the beautiful arts and crafts 
which she had learned from her par- 
ents and grandparents, The Negroes, 
save those who, like Becky whose child 
she had saved, disliked her. Becky’s 
srandmother, Granny Lou, incited an- 
other grand-daughter, Cisseretta to un- 
dertake to punish Bathesda out of 
jealousy for the local minister. 
Granny Lou is talking to Eliza, Cis- 
serretta’s mother. 


66° T AINT nothin’ to them Jeze- 
bel ’omans, noways. De 
white folks make me sick cayin’ on so 
high "bout dem. Day all sold dere 
souls to de debbil. Don’t dey fool 
‘round wid roots ’n things? . . . mind 
how dey nebber show dere natchul 
age lak we’uns does?” 

The silence that followed was 
broken by the sudsy slapping of wet 
clothes with home made lye soap. 
Eliza was too busy to bother about her 
old mother’s chatter this morning, but 
Granny Lou was nothing loath to 
amusing herself. 

“Becky, lak a li’l fool . . . she run 
up dere case day yaller ‘oman do foah 
dat brat ahern, jis what any of ussen 
coulda did. Ah knows, chal! Yo 
Granny Lou knowed dem f’om way 
back to Callie!” 

“Kyah, kyah, kyah! Granny Lou— 
hush yo mouf,” laughingly yelled 
Eliza above the suds, steam and slop, 
with perspiration dripping from her 
corn-rowed head into the tub. 

Cisseretta, who had entered the 
room unnoticed, flared up angrily at 
the old hag’s challenge— 

“Il wants Brother Parson Brown, 
and I’s shore goin’ to git him. "Taint 
goin’ to be after Thesday done chawed 
him, either, Granny!” So saying, she 
jammed her hands down upon her hips 
with her legs astride and frowned bel- 
ligerently from her mother to her grin- 
ning grandmother. 

_The pine door swung open admit- 
ting Becky, resplendent in a soft white 
dress carrying Li’l Jim who was spor- 
tive in a blue smock and cap. The 
three women were aghast at the sud- 
den picture. Poor Becky who was 
content to drudge in a one room cabin 
with her baby, for a husband who 


April, 1928 


scarcely could pay for his fat back and 
meal down at the store,—what right 
had she to look nicer than Cisserretta, 
the acknowledged social leader of 
Sinners Run! 

“Whar’d je git dem cloes?” darkly 
inquired Eliza of her daughter. 

“Oh Mammy! = Ain’t dey jist 
swell? Miss Thesdy done made dis 
up special foh me out o’ brand new 
goods case ah told huh ’twas my sec- 
ond year married, today! See Li’l 
Jim? Ain’t he grand? I has a big 
suppah foh Big Jim when he gits home 
and thought I would run in an let you 
folks see us.” 

“Humph! ‘Miss’ Thesdy! Since 
whin did we start ‘Missin’’ yaller nig- 


VA 
ee? 


“Nothing was said by the 


gers? Was Parson Brown anywhere 
bouts up there?” this from Cirseretta. 

“Seems to me dat dose clo’es would 
scorch yo’ skin, chal. Dat Thesdy is 
a woman wid no religion what- 
somever,” exasperatingly sighed Eliza. 

“Jes’ gib yo all dose cloes fuh to git 
yo’ wrapped up in huh, fudder—dan 
she gine conjuh yo. . . heah me, now, 
heah me!” snapped old Granny Lou 
with a portentious shaking of her be- 
shawled head. 


OOR Becky! All her joyous hap- 
piness so quickly transformed to 
bitter antagonism. 

“How come yo’all hates that pore 
woman so? What she done done 
aginst you? All I seed she done was 
good! She’s up dere in huh own pret- 


ty li’l house, amindin’ huh _ business, 
and you folks down heah hatin’ huh! 
Cisseretta? You won’t make no hit 
wid Parson Brown . . hatin’ Miss 
Thesdy, ‘case he thinks she is jest 
grand! As for me and Big Jim, she 
saved our boy’s life which is moah 
dan you what’s his own kin-folks done, 
and we loves huh, even ef she ain’t 
done professed ’ligion. From what I 
seed of huh and knowed of younes, 
she’s a heap sight nigh to God dan 
vou folks who eat out yo hearts wid 
hatin’ huh!” 

She gathered the bewildered Li’l 
Jim up and left the scene of unsympa- 
thetic relatives, muttering to herself— 
“Gawd! Effen I stayed widdem any 





four women”, page 122 


longer I would lose my own ’ligion. 
They’s my own folks, but dey simply 
breed evilness, and I doesn’t blame 
sweet Miss Thesdy from not minglin’ 
wid ’em, ’ceptin’ when she has to.” 

In the Lambert cabin, Granny Lou 
was grunting—‘See dat? She done 
got dat chal tu’ned agin huh own folks 
already . . . an de preachuh eatin’ out 
ob huh hand,”—with a cunning glance 
at Cisseretta. 

“For two cents, Granny—” whined 
Cisseretta, petulantly, “I’d git the wo- 
men together and go up to her ol’ 
house and beat her up!” 

“Kyah kyah! Lawsy' me! Hush 
yo’ mouf, chal!” elaborately guffawed 
her mother. 

“Go hade, den . . . go hade! Do 
moah—an’ talk less, honey!” huskily

whimpered the old woman to her in- 
furiated grandchild. 


HE day had been a busy one for 

Bathesda. She had contracted to 
make reproductions of the old sam- 
plers for an important Jewish antique 
dealer of Atlanta. Little Alice Thorn- 
ton, quite grown up, and home from 
college, had motored out to see her, 
bringing with her her fiancé from Bos- 
ton, an artist. He had begged for the 
privilege of painting Bathesda in all 
the glory of her little cottage and em- 
broidering frames. To please Alice, 
she consented, on condition that it 
wouldn’t interfere with her work. 

“Like one of Millet’s peasant wo- 
men,” he had said—‘‘and that interior! 
Worthy of the old Dutch masters.” 

The young minister had sat awhile, 
explaining his well meant plan of 
progress for his congregation, which 
she knew would never be accepted by 
the deluded Sinners Run folks, the 
present pastor being their first semi- 
nary man. They understood only the 
old fashioned untrained “called-but- 
not-sent” type of ministering. 

Becky and Lil Jim dropped in with 
the new things she had made for them, 
and the sight of the mother and 
child transformed by her handiwork, 
thrilled her deeply. 

She bent her queenly head over the 
crimson, green and purple threads she 
was interweaving so intricately into 
the words—‘“Heart within, God with- 
out” on the square of yellow, and 
smiled the smile of the middle-aged 
who had all they wanted in life— 
peace, pleasant labor, and contentment. 
Why should she be sad because of a 
God who withheld Himself, or the 
doubtful power of healing a people 
who despised her? 


HE decided to pick a fresh cabbage 

for her supper, and going to the 
door, was surprised to see Cisseretta 
Lambert approaching. With shifting 
eyes, and lowered brow, she informed 
Bathesda they had come to fetch her 
for a friend. At the little picket gate 
stood an old rickety home-made cart 
with ill matched wheels, drawn by a 
sorry nag whose hips punctured his 
skin in miss-meal significance. Eliza 
was driving and perched beside her for 
all the world like a bundled up mum- 
my, sat Granny Lou. 

“We kin fotch you there and back 
in no time, Thesdy. New folks jest 
come to Sinners Run, and powerful 
sick.” 

Bathesda hurriedly threw a light 
shawl around her shoulders with a 
strong sense of foreboding which she 
forcibly thrust out of her mind, and 
joined the trio at the cart. 

She and Cisseretta rode backwards 


122 





with their feet swinging, and nothing 

was said by the four women as the 

half dead animal faltered along the 

lonely road pulling the unbalanced, 

lurching, wabbling vehicle behind him. 
Then Eliza. . 


“Kyah kyah! Heah we all is, folk- 
sies! Kyah kyah! Lawdy, Lawdy, 
Lawd!” 


Bathesda turned from the back end 
of the wagon and saw glaring malevo- 
lently at her, the dark faces of ten or 
twelve women. They were as a pack 
of hungry hounds eager to be off on the 
chase. Cisseretta leaped from her seat 
on the wagon and rudely grabbed 
Bathesda, causing her to stumble to the 
ground on her knees. As if waiting 
for the initiative action from their 
leader, they pounced upon her, drag- 
ging her by the arms up the sloping 
hill side. The decrepit conveyance 
with the beswaddled old woman, was 
left standing on the road. 


HE maddened women yelled 

violent invectives — brandished 
whips, twigs and sticks aloft, dragging 
her roughly uphill, not allowing her 
to regain her foothold or the freedom 
of her arms. 

“Thought you’d git yo claws. on 
Revern Bro Brown, didn’t you? We 
see "bout dat, won’t we? Cain’t feed 
him none o’ yo hoodoo vittles . 
nuh-uh!” 

“Yes indeedy. We is gwine to see 
’bout all dis heah monkey business yo 
been cayin’ on all dese yeahs wid de 
men folks. . . .” 


“Think you better dan _ ussens, 
doesn’t you? Humph! Old _ half 
white niggers make me sick . . . caint 


be white an’ caint be black!” 
“Naw! We niggers don’t want you 
and de white folks won’t hab you! 


“Lawdy, Lawdy, Lawd today! 
Yeowh!” 

“Pull huh ol’ plaits down! Make 
me tiahd wid huh ol’ dawg _ har! 


Wouldn’t have straight har, mahself— 
Revelations say as plain as day—‘har 
lak lambs wool’ like ussen got... .” 

“Sis Grenn? Dis is shoah a holy 
deed Cisseretta done called on us to 
do . . to pertect ouah poah pastor 
from de wiles ob dis sinner woman. 


' “Kyah kyah! Lawd today!” 


HEY reached the summit of the 

hill which was capped with a 
small patch of woods. A few of the 
trees had recently been chopped down, 
judging by the fresh stumps. The 
several women in whose clutches 
Bathesda had fallen, suddenly re- 
leased their hold on her and jumped 
back out of her reach. But Bathesda 
merely stomped the caked dirt from 
her shoes and torn skirt, thru a quiet 





searching glance around the semi-circle 
of women, and made to swing her 
loosened braids around her head. 

This action galled Cisseretta, who 
saw in it a self assurance, a com. 
posure that was shaking the courag 
of her vigilance committee. She sprang 
at Bathesda heavily with an angy 
snarl, pushing her back into a tre 
which instantaneously crashed to the 
earth, sideways, sending Cisseretta and 
all the women scrambling and yelping 
down the hill. 

“Conjuh woman! conjuh 
Lawd ah’s feared!” 


“Hoodoo stuff! Told yo'all we 
oughten to bother wid huh! 


“Lawd! Jist ‘low me to git home 
oncet moah . . . please!” 

“Cisseretta done got ussen into dis 
mess . * . 


From the opposite direction came 
two white men, hurrying toward Bz 
thesda who stood arranging her hair 
beside the fallen tree. 

“Anybody hurt, Auntie? We are 
clearing these here woods for Ben 
Lovett who has bought the strip, and 
my buddy here—he sprained his joint 
while chopping down that ‘un a few 
minutes ago. We went up to my shack 
after some liniment and we didn't 
‘reckon anyone would come along be- 
fore we got back. The tree was near- 
ly cut thru and I ’spec a slight jostle 
knocked her over.” 

“No one was hurt. It fell to the 
side,’ murmured the yellow woman 
absently—eyes searching into the dis- 
tance. 

A delicate tenderness played over 


her face, and kindly wrinkles ap- ¥ 


peared about her mouth and forehead. 
Like Haggard’s “She”, Bathesda un- 
expectedly looked her age, all at once. 
She had dropped the cloak of a hard- 
ened, held-over youth, and taken on 
the ethereal robe of an inner beauty— 
a soul transformation had taken place. 

She, for the first time, turned di- 
rectly to the lumberjacks, and asked 
of the one with the bandaged arm— 

“Ts it bad?” 

“Hurts mightily and swellin’ every 
second.” 


HE unwrapped the crude bandage, 

wiped away the stench of liniment, 
cupped her two hands about the 
swollen arm and gazed upward—her 
thin lips moving almost imperceptibly 
while the men stood transfixed. 

She finally withdrew her hands, 
clenched them into tight fists and then 
shook them open and away from her, 
as if throwing off the contamination of 
alien flesh. 

“Now . . . it is well!” 

“Bill! Honest to John! She's

HE Changing South by William 

J. Robertson (Boni and Live- 
right) is funny and pathetic. It is 
the writing of a man wishing to burst 
his bonds, seeing the breadth of the 
earth, and yet quite unable to venture. 
It can best be judged by a few quota- 
tions from Chapter V on “The Ne- 


” 
o > 


ro”: 
” “The relationship between the slaves 
and their masters was such that the 
Negroes became devoted to their white 
owners, and the latter formed a real 
affection for the blacks.” .. . 

“Not a few, but many, of the mu- 
lattoes are blood kin to the F. F. V.’s 
in Virginia, to the first families in 
South Carolina, and to the blue bloods 
in the other Southern States, but they 
cannot, of course, be accepted as kins- 
men.” ... 

“The Southern white not only -un- 
derstands the Negro better than the 
Northern white, but he is more honest 
in his attitude toward him. When I 
say this I recognize that technically it 
is wrong to deny- the Negro the right 
of suffrage or any other of his civic 
rights; but the South’s honesty is based 
upon a fact—which many Northern- 
ers are beginning to recognize—that 
the two races must. live together, 
apart. That is to say, there can never 
be any widespread social intercourse 
between them. The racial differences 
are too strong to permit it. Why God 
created these differences is something 
for God to explain.” .. . 

“In the circumstances, the white 
Southerners believe they are honest in 
their treatment of the Negro in so far 
as social intercourse is concerned. 
Whether their God will forgive them 
for the crime of the mulatto is some- 
thing I cannot pass upon; but I do 
know that the reason and the only 
reason why they attempt to deny the 
Negro his political and sometimes his 
civil rights, is because they are afraid 
that his next desire will be social equal- 
ity, something which they rightfully 
consider to be impossible.” . . . 

“Who can read the plaintive poems 
of Paul Dunbar, of another genera- 
tion, or of Countée Cullen, of this 
generation, without realizing that in 
the Negro race in America are souls 
that aspire to the stars? And who 
are there among the whites who would 
deny them the beauty of the stars? 
But emotions, dreams and talents — 
art itself—cannot eradicate the distin- 
guishing lines that Nature lays down, 
even though, in doing so, she buries

the heart of a poet beneath the dust 
of caste, or stills with the cries of in-

On the 80th anniversary of the Cen- 
tral Baptist Church of St. Louis, the 
pastor, George E. Stevens, has pub- 
lished a history of the church filling 
nearly one hundred large pages. The 
first pastor of the church was John 
B. Meachum, who, as carpenter and 
cooper, purchased over 20 slaves, in- 
cluding his own wife and children. 
The church, at present, is one of the 
largest in colored St. Louis.

IN THE MAGAZINES 
RAY of light on the Negro’s 


position in the South comes from 
darkest Mississippi in Plain Talk for 
November when Howard Snyder, a 
white Southerner, admits that “The 
South Bungles the Negro Question”’. 
Mr. Snyder says that one of the great- 
est injustices of the white South to 
her dark brethren is the fact that she 
sees the Negro as a class and not as 
an individual, for no matter how bril- 
liant his intellect, no matter how fair 
his skin, no matter how clean his mo- 
rals, the Negro is, to the Southern 
public, “just a nigger”. Another com- 
mon error of the South in regard to 
the Negro is the continuance of the 
credit system. This discourages owner- 
ship of land, which, in itself, is a 
source of poor farming. Mr. Snyder 
also points out that mob violence is 
not only atrocious, but it is unintelli- 
gent, because it causes the exodus of 
the Negro to the North. This is the 
very thing the South does not want, 
for she needs black labor to till her 
fields, build her roads and run her fac- 
tories.

Masses.for February. We quote a few 
lines: 

“The sun, 

Like the red yolk of a rotten egg, 

Falls behind the roller-coaster 

And the horizon stinks 

With a putrid odor of colors.” 

Bruce Bliven in the New Republic 
for February 8 and February 15 sends 
us two esoteric papers from the Pan- 
American Conference. In these ar- 
ticles, Mr. Bliven offers us glimpses of 
some of the chief attitudes which were 
on exhibit at the farce at Havana. Al- 
though amiabilities were mainly on the 
surface, he says, openly intransigent 
opponents were kept at home, as in the 
case of Haiti, by main force. Mr. 
Bliven discusses the main preoccupa- 
tions and desires of the countries pres- 
ent at the conference, and comes to 
the conclusion that the Sixth Pan- 
American Conference was a grand flop. 

Sandino, the twenty-eight year old 
Nicaraguan rebel-patriot, has assumed 
vast importance in contemporary his- 
tory and the tales being woven about 
him will doubtless be progenitors of 
future epics. The March World To- 
morrow describes an unsuccessful “Try 
at Peace and Justice With Sandino” 
which was sponsored by the Fellow- 
ship of Reconciliation and the Ameri- 
can Friends Service Committee. John 
Sayre, who was a member of the com- 
mittee sent to interview Sandino, tells 
of the divers difficulties thrown in his 
path which kept him from meeting 
Sandino personally. 

The Nation also has sent Carleton 
Beals to Nicaragua to find and in- 
terview Sandino, and the first and sec- 
ond of his stories appear in the Feb- 
ruary 15 and February 29 issues of 
that magazine. In these installments 
Mr. Beals describes his dramatic trek 
through Guatemala and Honduras, to 
Nicaragua, and leaves us in suspense 
before the mysterious mountain fort- 
ress, El] Chipote, which Sandino re- 
cently evacuated. 

Moorfield Storey in Century for 
February criticizes the unconscionable 
attitude of the United States toward 
Nicaragua. Mr. Storey scathingly de- 
nounces America for her greedy ex- 
ploitation of Latin America; and for 
her militant method of attempting to 
destroy the peace and independence of 
our neighbors to the South.

bate Judge. 


@ Hartshorn Memorial College, 
Richmond, Va., has hitherto been co- 
ordinated with Virginia Union Uni- 
versity. After June 1, it will become 
an independent institution, limited at 
first to high school work, and eventu- 
ally becoming a woman’s college. 


@ Samuel Huston College has been 
recently rated as a standard A college 
by the North Carolina Board of Edu- 
cation. The college is making a study 
of education in Texas. 


@ Miss Helen Daniels, an 11th grade 
pupil at the Downington Industrial 
School, Pa., received first place among 
the contestants in the annual essay 
contest. Fourteen schools in Chester 
County competed in the contest. 


NORTH AFRICA 
@ The Egyptian Confederation of 


Labor has been violently suppressed 
by the government and the British, 
the excuse being that the Confedera- 
tion had communist tendencies. Most 
of the leaders have been put in jail or 
killed. A new confederation. of trade 
unions has recently arisen, including 
the state railway men, printers, bak- 
ers, masons and hair dressers. 


@ The Italians are fighting the Arabs 
and mulattos in Cyrenaica, North 
Africa. In one engagement 29 were 
killed and 250 prisoners taken. 


WEST AFRICA 


@ Chief Joachim Acolatse of Keta, 
Gold Coast, West Africa, is dead at 
the age of 87. He was one of the 
great leaders in the economic de- 
velopment of the colony. He is suc- 
ceeded by Robert Joachim Acolatse. 


@ The bridge over the River Benue, 
Nigeria, will be the longest in Africa. 
It will cost nearly $5,000,000 and 
consist of thirteen spans, the total 
length being 2,584 feet. The con- 
struction has just been contracted for 
and it will be finished in five years. 


@ The Kenya and Nigeria Railway 
has been extended from Turbo in 
Kenya to Mbulamuti in Uganda. This 
is the most important extension since 
the original line to Mombasa was 
built, 30 years, ago. 


@ A bill is being prepared for the 
French Parliament providing for the 
spending of $500,000 for preliminary 
surveys of the Trans-Sahara Railway 
running from the French colonies of 
North Africa to those of West Africa. 
It is estimated that a capital of $65,- 
000,000 will be needed to build the 


railway. 


@ British Nigeria has now a popu- 
lation of nearly 19,000,000. It is a 
political organization involving “indi- 
rect” rule: that is, limited local gov- 
ernment under the chiefs. The rev- 
enue of the native administrations dur- 
ing the years 1926-27 amounted to 
nearly $5,000,000. The value of 
Nigerian trade for 1926 is eight times 
as great as in 1900. 


@ King Albert of Belgium is going 
to visit the Belgian Congo at the open- 
ing of the Lower Congo-Katanga Rail- 
way. 


@ The report on the British Man- 
date in Cameroon, West Africa shows 
that very little is being done for edu- 
cation. Out of a total revenue of 
$425,000 only $40,000 was spent for 
education. The exports were worth 
over a million dollars. Local native 
rule is widely recognized.

EAST AFRICA 
cA considerable number of natives 
are in training in the mission schools 
of Portuguese East Africa. One, at 
St. Paul in Gaza, has more than 2,000 
pupils. ‘They are taught Portuguese, 
some foreign languages, crafts and 
agriculture. 

@ Because of the murder of a Dis- 
trict Commissioner in the Sudan, 
Great Britain has sent a force to wage 
war on the Nuong clan in the eastern 
part of the Bahr el Ghazal province 
and also against the country of the 
Lau Nuers in the triangle between 
the Nile and the Sobat Rivers. In 
the latter operation the British and 
Sudanese troops bombed and killed 
hundreds of cattle. 


@ In 1914 the Higher School of the 
Gordon Memorial College in the Su- 
dan had 67 pupils. In 1926 there 
were 303 and in 1927, 360. It is ex- 
pected that there will be 500 in 1929. 
There are courses of training for en- 
gineers, teachers, accountants; and also 
of Kadis for the Mohammedan law 
courts. In the northern and central 
Sudan there were in 1926, 18,983 pu- 
pils. 

@ Uganda exported 125,788 400- 
pound bales of cotton in 1927. 


@ The new Sir Lee Stack Memorial 





School at Wau has been opened in 
the southern Sudan. 
SOUTH AFRICA 

@ The Carnegie Corporation of New 
York has granted $500,000 to East 
and South Africa. Very little of this 
affects Negroes: Seven Thousand and 
Five Hundred Dollars is suggested for 
a research into “Bantu mentality”; 
Ninety Thousand Dollars is for ex- 
change visits between West Africa and 
America of leaders in science, social 


work and education; technical educa- 


tion for non-Europeans will receive 
some support. 

@ Indians in South Africa are re- 
turning in considerable numbers to In- 
dia. Two Thousand One Hundred 
went in 1926 and 2,986 in 1927. The 
migration is increasing this year. 

@ The I. C. U., the black Labor 
Union of South Africa, has been re- 
fused admission into Southern Ri:ode- 
sia by the premier. Clements Kadalie 
declares that the Union will be or- 
ganized there in spite of the ban; that 
free speech “is non-existent in south- 
ern Rhodesia as it is in other parts of 
the British Empire” and that the Na- 
tive Affairs Act is a “slave measure” 
which brings us back “to the border 
line of the Dark Ages’. 

@ The National Council of the In- 


dustrial and Commercial Workers’ 


Union (1. C. U.) met in Johannes- 
burg in January and memorialized the 
South African Trade Union Co-or- 
dinating Committee for affiliation. 
The manifesto accuses the Trade 
Union Congress of race prejudice and 
refuses periodical meetings for con- 
sultation. It declares that Negroes 
will not be patronized as_ inferiors. 
“We are the real working class in 
South Africa.” 

@ General Arthur |. Ferraz is the 
new Portuguese minister for the col- 
onies. He succeeded Commander 
Joao Bello and was some time ago 
Governor General of Mozambique. 
@ The revenue of Tanganyika terri- 
tory, formerly German East Africa, 
is estimated at $10,000,000 for the 
year 1928-29. 

@ The Transvaal African Congress 
has petitioned the Minister of Native 
Affairs not to send natives of Central 
Africa into South Africa on account 
of the feuds between the various 
tribes. These “foreign” natives are 
often not subjected to the pass laws 
and other restrictions, which raises 
strong feeling.

THE FAR HORIZON 


Bc 
THE RISING NEGRO 


HE Emporia, Kansas, Gazette has 
this editorial: 

A most interesting little book on char- 
acter analysis, by which the average man 
can obtain some sidelights into his own 
character by answering a few apparently 
guileless questions, includes this tricky 
one: “Do you think a Negro doctor is 
as capable as a white doctor?” And a 
large part of the population, governed 
by prejudices of which it is unaware, 
would answer “No” and, turning to the 
back of the book would find that this 
answer stamped them as having racial 
prejudice. 

The Negro professional man in Amer- 
ica, outside the larger cities, labors un- 
der tremendous handicaps. Considering 
the obstacles imposed on them, jit is 
amazing that so many have been able 
to succeed. 


In the larger cities, brilliant Negro 
lawyers and singers, successful Negro 
surgeons and actors, are no longer a 
curiosity. But the Negro professional 
man has to contend with the prejudices 
of his own race, as well as those of the 
white people. 


Many Negroes, accustomed to take the 
white man at his face value, uncon- 
sciously accept his assumption of superi- 
ority in the professions, and when they 
are sick or when they need a lawyer, 
they prefer to intrust themselves to a 
white doctor or lawyer, although there 
may be Negro professional men who are 
much more highly skilled. These preju- 
dices are as deeply ingrained in the 
Negro race as they are in the white race. 
It is commonly observed, in states which 
permit traveling Negroes to eat in the 
dining cars, that the Negro waiters fre- 
quently take occasion to slight and iv 
insult in small ways the Negroes who 
venture in. The Negro waiters feel that 
the Negro diner is “putting on airs” by 
eating in the dining car, and take occa- 
sion to show their prejudices. 

The Negro race, if it is to gain equal- 
ity in the professions with the white race, 
must respect its own professional men 
—its many brilliant teachers, actors, 
lawyers, doctors and ministers. 

The Editorial is true in the main, 
but is untcrtunate in its illustration: 
The porters on Pullman cars and the

THE RELIGION OF STUDENTS 


ELLE C. MORRILL writes in 

the Epworth Herald, Chicago, on 
the religious difficulties of Negro Stu- 
dents: 


Students at home in the country in the 
summer vacation are tempted to stay 
away from the long harangue of the 
illiterate preacher. The normal school 
graduate who takes a rural school faces 
Scylla and Charybdis. If she does not 
attend services, to her, crude and unin- 
teresting, she will not be regarded as a 
proper person to teach the children in a 
simple-minded, religious community. If 
she is asked to teach in Sunday School, 
her refusal may brand her as a heathen; 
her acceptance may prove her a heretic! 

Someone has said that Christianity 
has not only love but dynamite in its 
teachings. A study of the teachings and 
life of Jesus is a dangerous theme for 
Negro students today. They are coming 
to see more and more that he had no 
place for, no sympathy with the preju- 
dice which they see practiced daily by 
white Christians who crowd the white 
churches on Sunday. To see this dif- 
ference without being cynical; to be de- 
termined to live up to the ideals of Jesus 
even if no one else in the world should 
do it, this is another problem that faces 
thinking Negro youth. 

Negro students, then, are of various 
religious types, even as are white stu- 
dents, but they have the added problem of 
the contradiction between the universality 
of Jesus and the narrow prejudices of 
white Christianity. Few of them are con- 
tent, as were their grandparents and in 
some cases their parents, to leave all 
social adjustment to Heaven. There seems 
likely to be an increased turning away 
from religion which need not be, if white 
Christians learn to say and act as they 
meet these brown Christians, “No longer 
do I call you servants, but I have called 
you friends!” 


FROM CULTIVATED MIS- 
SISSIPPI 


E quote a recent editorial from 

the Jackson, Mississippi, Daily 
News with apologies to the World 
Tomorrow. 


There is another Negro publication, 
known as “The World Tomorrow”, en- 
couraged if not actually fostered by that 
despicable organization of social equality 
advocates known as “The American As- 
sociation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People”. It is an organization that 
has not to its credit a single achievement 
for the advancement of colored people, 
and perhaps the less said about the per- 
sonnel of its membership the better. 





x 


We are not getting down to the sub- 
ject. A recent issue of “The Chicago 
Defender”, sent to the “Daily News” by 
special delivery, contains the following 
editorial: 

In his campaign speech, just prior 
to his election as Governor of Mis- 
sissippi, Brother Bilbo, according to 
“The World Tomorrow”, made the 
following statement: 

“There are not 2,000 negroes 
qualified to vote.” 

“The World Tomorrow”’ follows 
this up with the statement that “The 
United States census of 1920 de- 
clares that of 453,663 Negroes 21 
years of age and over living in 
Mississippi 290,782 can read and 
write.” 

With these facts upon which to 
work, the question now is, How 
did Governor Bilbo get elected? 
How did he arrive at the conclusion 
that only 2,000 persons were quali- 
fied to vote? Just what, besides be- 
ing white, is a qualification to vote 
in Mississippi? 

And, incidentlly, wasn’t it this 
same Governor Bilbo, who, during 
one of his previous administrations, 
wired Dr. DuBois in answer to a 
query as to what he intended to do 
about a lynching in that state: 
“Nothing. Go to h—”! 

At any rate, that’s Mississippi for 
you—and that’s its Governor. 

If Bilbo really did send that telegram 
to DuBois—and we can readily imagine 
he did—then we glory in his spunk and 
also applaud his terseness of expression. 

DuBois is a Northern Negro who 
hates the South and everything Southern. 
He is brilliantly educated, but has a 
warped mind. He is perhaps the most 
vicious,’ vindictive, volatile, and uncom- 
promising hater of the Seuthern white 
man who ever lived. If yeu have any 
doubts concerning this diagmesis, read 2 
few of the books he has written. 

Apropos of the small number of 
Negroes eligible for suffrage in Missis- 
sippi, “The Chicago Defender”, “The 
World Tomorrow”, and other social 
equality publications, have only to read 
the constitution of the commenwealth to 
find out how we have reduced Negro 
suffrage to a minimum. 

Incidentally, the aforesaid constitution 
has been upheld by the Supreme Court 
of the United States, so there is nothing 
they can do about it. 

At any rate, the people of Mississippi 
are not going to do anything to relieve 
the deplorable condition complained of 
by “The Chicago Defender” and “The 
World Tomorrow”. We are quite well 
satisfied with things as they are. 

In the language of Theodore Bilbo, 
“Go to hell!” 





THE Crisis 











SS Te 








DISCOVERING SEYMOUR 
CARROLL 


N unnamed daily paper in Green- 

ville, South Carolina, is quoted 
in the Nashville Baptist Union Re- 
ew : 
: Seymour Carroll is the son of Rev. 
Richard Carroll, broadly known in South 
Carolina and other Southern States as 
a Negro Baptist minister who has 
wrought long with exceptional ability, 
and did much toward a better under- 
standing between the whites and Negroes 
in the South. Rev. Richard Carroll is 
now an invalid. We hail with satisfac- 
tion tokens that his son Seymour may 
become a voice concerning race relations 
in the South as sane and wholesome as 
has long been that of his father. 

The substance of the utterance of Mr. 
Carroll, who is Field Secretary of the 
American Humane Education Society, 
180 Longwood Avenue, Boston, Mass., 
was in his criticism of the National As- 
sociation for the Advancemnnt of Col- 
ored People, with headquarters in New 
York. It is our understanding that this 
is the organization of which the radical 
and bitter-hearted Boston half-blood 
Negro and Spaniard, W. E. B. Dubois, 
is the informing spirit. DuBois is be- 
lieved by informed persons to be doing 
more at the present time to stir up race 
antagonism than all other forces com- 
bined. He is the editor of a periodical, 
and through it his characteristic work 
is to propagate malignant views against 
white people. Unhappily the Dubois 
cult has already made inroads among 
some Negro elements in the South. 
Negro preachers, who are leadership of 
the race, generally deplore the Dubois 
method—and ‘this is reassuring. * * * 

Seymour Carroll plainly told his 
Southern Negro school audience that the 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People has done more 
to hurt the Negro in his relation to the 
whites in the South than to help him. 
Many whites have come to the same con- 
clusion, and we rejoice that this gifted 
young Negro leader, showing the same 
fine courage his father has always shown, 
does not hesitate to come out and tell 


his people what he believes on the sub- 
ject. 


IN THE COCOA COUNTRY 


HE London, England, Daily 
Sketch has this note: 


When he was going down from Ash- 
anti to the Coast a little while ago he 
stopped at a wayside halt, and went into 
a tiny village store. 

There he noticed a boy of about six- 
teen, dressed in a smock and nothing 
else, addressing an envelope. The writ- 
ing was so good that Colonel Levey 
asked if he could see it. It was ad- 
dressed to the Master of an Oxford col- 
ege. 

“You write very well,” said the Col- 
onel. “Where were you educated?” 

“At the Government School in Coom- 
assie, sir. I am writing now to Oxford, 
because I want to go to the University.” 


April, 1928 


Colonel Levey looked at the boy. It 
was only a smock he wore. It might 
just as well have been a loin cloth. So 
he asked him where he lived. 

“Over there, with my father.” The 
boy pointed out of the door to mud hut 
across the way. 

“And does your father know that it 
costs money to go to Oxford?” 

“Oh! yes, sir. He knows it will cost 
£500 a year, and he will allow me that.” 

Colonel Levey, wondering how £500 
a year was to come out of an Ashanti 
mud hut, asked what the boy’s father 
was. It turned out that he was a cocoa 
farmer, the son of one of King Prem- 
peh’s savage warriors, but now a man 
of property and prosperity. 


TRIAL BY JURY IN BRITISH 
WEST AFRICA 


MERICAN Negroes should fol- 

low with interest the fine fight 
which Dr. Bankole Bright, a well- 
known barrister of Sierra Leone, is 
making to restore trial by jury in 
Sierra Leone. The facts of the case 
are thus stated in an editorial in the 


London African World: 


This dissatisfaction with the criminal 
law of Sierra Leone which has long ex- 
isted in that Colony, has been given def- 
inite form by Dr. Bankole Bright’s ad- 
dress to the West African students in 
London, on which we commented in our 
issue of October 22nd. The trial of 
Mr. C. T. May, former Mayor of Free- 
town, and three of the officials of the 
Corporation for embezzlement attracted 
attention and called forth much com- 
ment. This has now been focussed by 
Dr. Bright in a series of statements 
which cannot be ignored by the Colonial 
Office or the local government. Dr. 
Bright is a well-known public man, 
whose words carry weight. As a medi- 
cal practitioner of long standing he has 
gained the confidence of his people who 
have elected him to the Legislative Coun- 
cil as the Second Urban Member. 
Speaking with the responsibility of that 
position he makes serious and definite 
criticism of the administration of the 
law in the colony. He states that in 
1894 the legal system under which trial 
by jury was established and had been 
carried on for 85 years to the general 
satisfaction was altered because the Gov- 
ernor (Sir Frederick Cardew) was dis- 
satisfied at the acquittal, by a jury, of 
an African official charged with embez- 
zlement: in order to secure the convic- 
tion of this official the “Assessors Ordi- 
nance” was hastily passed through the 
Legislative Council in spite of protests 
from the Bar and the public. By this 
ordinance the judge presiding at a trial 
is bound, if the Attorney-General ap- 
plies for it, to appoint assessors to hear 
the case instead of a jury, but is not 
bound to accept their verdict. Dr. 
Bright alleges that the Attorney-Gen- 
eral exercises this discretion only in 
cases in which educated Africans are 
criminally charged. Illiterate Africans 
are allowed the privilege of trial by 
jury, but educated Africans, especially 


officials and public men, are tried by a 
judge who can, and frequently does, ig- 
nore the opinion of his assessors, and 
can convict accused persons whom the 
assessors have pronounced not guilty. 
Dr. Bright has stated that “95 per cent 
of educated Africans tried by Judge Pur- 
cell with the aid of assessors have been 
convicted as the result of the judge over- 
riding the assessors”, and cited specific 
cases. A person thus convicted has no 
right of appeal, but the judge may, if 
he so elects, state a case for the Full 
Court. Even if the judge should elect 
to do so the ‘appeal is virtually to him- 
self as he sits as President of the Court 
which hears it. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that Dr. Bright has raised the 
question of a West African Appeal 
Court for both civil and criminal cases 
which has been pressed by all the Col- 
onies for some years past. They are 
able and willing to bear the expense. 
As Dr. Bright’s speech has been reported 
in the Press, and is issued in pamphlet 
form, it cannot be passed over on a plea 
of official ignorance. His challenge must 
be taken up; his position as a member 
of his local legislature gives the Gov- 
ernment opportunity to call upon him to 
substantiate, or withdraw, his allega- 
tions; if it fail to do so its failure will 
be regarded as avoidance, or admission 
of their truth. 


N West Africa, London, Dr. Bright 


replies to critics: 


I submit to the British public that I 
have established a case for the considera- 
tion of the Colonial Office and the Brit- 
ish public. I submit that I have estab- 
lished the fact that there has been mis- 
carriage of justice in Sierra Leone; that 
the adminsitration of justice in Sierra 
Leone courts is less satisfactory than the 
administration of justice in some of our 
primitive courts. I submit that I have 
established the fact that the Ordinance 
is used as a lever to wreck the honour of 
educated Africans, particularly the pub- 
lic man, and I say that the essential 
facts have been established not only by 
myself but by the majority of the edu- 
cated Africans and by the records of the 
courts of Sierra Leone. I submit that I 
have made out a case for the repeal of 
ithe Ordinance, for the re-introduction 
of the system of trial by jury in all cases, 
and for the creation of an independent 
criminal appeal court. 


I feel that by the present operation of 
the Ordinance Government is setting up 
a class of educated criminals who when 
opportunity arises will become hostile to 
British rule and order. I appeal to the 
British nation to call for a halt to this 
travesty of justice. I appeal to the 
Colonial Office to recognize its sacred 
trust to protect the liberty of the people 
of West Africa. No Englishman would, 
conscious of what is taking place in the 
courts of Sierra Leone, allow such op- 
erations to continue. , 

Something has happened lately which 
has set us all thinking. Mr. Osoba 
May, son of Cornelius May, a victim of 
this Ordinance, is dead. This young

man, we know, has, apart from other 
conditions, died with a perplexed mind 
on account of the treatment of his 
father. It is stated (I do not know how 
true it is), that after the conviction of 
his father he approached the Judge re- 
questing him to send him to prison in 
place of his father. After his father’s 
conviction, Osoba May cut off most of 
his associations; he brooded over his 
father’s trouble and walked in the streets 
of Freetown with bowed head and heavy 
mind. He was positive that his father 
was innocent, and he believed that his 
imprisonment was a plot. He was per- 
plexed and dejected, and even on his 
dying bed it is alleged that he never 
failed to repeat that his father had been 
wickedly treated, and we know that he 
died deeply grieving over his father’s 
misfortune. 

I stand for a strong organic connec- 
tion between West Africa and the 
Motherland. I shall ever resist in my 
humble way any attempt to soil or 
break this connection, but I shall always 
insist that justice be meted out to all, 
irrespective of creed, class or colour. 

When we remember that Government 
has control in selection of jurors, by 
which I mean that the Attorney-General 
has the right of ulimited challenge, a 
system which has now and again been 
put into operation, and when we also re- 
member that a special jury list of re- 
spectable and educated members of the 
community could be made up, we feel 
that trial by jury could easily be rein- 
troduced. 

We appeal for the reintroduction of 
ithe system of trial by jury in all cases, 
together with the constitution of an in- 
dependent criminal appeal court for 
West Africa, where three independent 
judges, from England, would administer 
the law according to the law. 


THE COLOR BAR IN SOUTH 
AFRICA 


HE Star of Johannesburg, Trans- 
vaal, South Africa, has this edi- 
torial : 


The very heart of the problem of the 
relationship of the white and coloured 
races in South Africa is exposed in Pro- 
fessor W. M. Macmillan’s latest book, 
“The Cape Colour Question”. The 
author delves deeply into events and con- 
ditions in the Cape Colony during the 
earlier part of last century and throws 
fresh light upon much that was previ- 
ously obscure. We are given in some 
detail the interesting history of the Hot- 
tentots, the native race inhabiting the 
Cape at the time of its first white col- 
onization. Soon after the nineteenth 
century opened, this race had been al- 
ready merged into the Cape coloured 
people, receiving in the process an ad- 
mixture of Bantu, Malay and European 
blood. The Hottentot type persists to 
a large extent, and the author himself 
stresses the fact that the remarkable rise 
of this coloured race in the scale of civ- 
ilization is due, not to the infusion of 
a small proportion of other blood, but to 


132 





contact with Europeans, even though 
such contact was, until comparatively 
recent date, by way of slavery or serf- 
dom. The rise of the coloured people, 
intellectually, socially and politically, is 
all the more striking in view of the 
events which accompanied it, first the 
abolition of slavery, then the politico- 
missionary campaign, in which Dr. John 
Philip was the chief figure, and finally 
the establishment of representative gov- 
ernment at the Cape. The book is 
largely concerned with the activities and 
writings of Dr. Philip, and it vividly 
presents the struggles, bitterness and 
blunderings of those days. If it may not 
at once rehabilitate Dr. Philip in the 
esteem of all South Africans, it will cer- 
tainly do much to remove the absurd 
misconceptions which have prevailed in 
the past, and which have been strength- 
ened by the biased accounts of his life 
and times which have passed muster as 
history. 


LABOR UNIONS IN SOUTH 
AFRICA 


HE Cape Town correspondent of 

the African World, London, dis- 
cusses the problem of native trade 
unions: 


The problem of native trade unionism 
becomes increasingly acute, and it is ob- 
vious that the movement is destined to 
become a vital factor in the economic 
life of the country. To endeavor to 
stamp out the movement would be futile, 
and for that reason the hostility of cer- 
tain farmers towards laborers, belong- 
ing to a trade union is to be deplored. 
There is no earthly reason why a native 
should not belong to an organization 
which seeks to safeguard his interests. 
It is as well to recognize the fact. 

The policy of evicting natives from 
farms and of replacing native labour by 
European labour in some industries has 


_ led to considerable bitterness, which was 


expressed at the first annual convention 
of the African National Congress at 
Kimberly. The natives, it was con- 
tended, had helped in the development of 
the industrial and commercial life of 
this country. In consequence it was not 
fair for the white man to take up an 
attitude of antagonism to native labour- 
ers. The black races were urged to 
stand together as one man. 

European trade unions are finding the 
growth of African trade unionism em- 
barrassing because they find it hard to 
reconcile their views on equality of op- 
portunity, irrespective of colour or creed, 
with their refusal to co-operate with 
their black brethren. The I. C. U. 
wants to become affliated with the white 
‘trade unions, but the latter feel the 
time is not yet ripe for such co-operation, 
“whilst keeping in view the soundness 
of the principle that all bona fide trade 
unions and employees’ associations 
should be linked up in a national co-or- 
dinating body, and through that national 
body to the international organization.” 

A pretty high-sounding phrase, which 
reminds one of the old saying about 


sympathy without relief being like mus- 
tard without beef. The truth of the 
matter is that the trade unions have 
shied at the issue, and are playing for 
time in the hope that some solution wil] 
turn up. 


Among the objections to affiliation 
with the I. C. U. is that the 100,000 
members claimed by the I. C. U. would 
on a card vote in any congress outvote 
all other unions put together if a division 
took place, as is possible, on race lines, 


THE SOUTHERN MOB 


WO extracts illustrates the mob 

spirit of the Bourbon South. 
James Bond writes in the Louisville 
Herald Post: 


As an evidence that mobs often lynch 
the wrong person, it is related that 
while a mob of several hundred ‘white 
farmers in Arkansas were searching the 
country-side in an effort to locate Elbert 
Thomas, 18-year-old Negro boy, whom 
they suspected of being responsible for 
the death of Julius McCullum, 11-year- 
old white boy, the colored youth’s body 
was discovered lifeless in the woods half 
buried under a clump of bushes and 
partly in the water where he had put 
up a heroic fight to save the life of the 
littke white boy whom he was suspected 
of slaying. This became known when 
Grady Swain, white, 19, confessed that 
he and Robert Bell, white, had mur- 
dered the little boy because they knew 
he usually: had money on his person. 
The confession states that not only did 
they drown the white boy, but killed the 
colored boy in his effort to save his little 
companion. 


HE following extract is taken 
from the Potter’s Wheel: 


Few men _ build schools, _ revive 
churches, improve economic conditions 
—and are asked to move on _ because 
they succeed. 


Yet that is part of the story of Mr. 
Hannar, a young Negro preacher from 
Georgia, as he told it in a great Metro- 
politan church in Boston. 


Mr. Hannar is a graduate of Pea- 
body Academy, in Troy, N. C., graduate 
of Talladega College and Seminary, and 
has had training for rural church work. 

His first charge was at Bexar, Ala- 
bama. Interested in community im- 
provements, he secured a Rosenwald 
school for his colored parishioners. It 
was a good school—so good that the 
school inspector used it to shame the 
white people by a too-pointed compari- 
son with their own educational facilities. 

This fling did not have the desired ef- 
feot. It inspired not shame but jealousy. 
Hannar had incurred the hatred of cer- 
tain financial interests in the community 
by obtaining farm loans at 8 per cent, 
thus depriving the local Shylocks of the 
15 per cent they were charging ignorant 
Negro farmers. The school jealousy 
was excuse enough and the Negro leader 
was asked to select a new field of labor.

OF THINGS CONTEMPTIBLE 


NCE in a while one comes across 

a backwash of race discrimina- 
tion, so contemptible as to be almost 
unbelievable. We set this down to 
keep the record accurate. In Phila- 
delphia a young colored man suddenly 
disappeared. He was a brilliant stu- 
dent and a fine, manly character. His 
frantic parents sought him by every 
method and failed. Finally, they 
asked the Philadelphia daily papers to 
carry his picture offering to pay anv 
cost. Not a single Philadelphia pa- 
per—the Public Ledger, the Bulletin, 
the Inquirer—none of them, would 
carry the picture. They said it was 
against their policy to print pictures 
of colored folk! The boy has never 
been found.

EDUCATION 


ERE comes again our up-to-date 

United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion with a bulletin on “Statistics of 
State School Systems, 1926-27”. But 
do not look for any real information 
on Negro School systems of the South. 
Oh no! Not a word as to their cost, 
the taxation of rent and labor that 
supports them, the division of public 
funds—on all this silence like the 
grave. We can, of course, learn that 
the annual cost of state school sys- 
tems, per pupil attending, is: 


PS oe. oad $41.00 
pO SE ees 39.00 
Georgia ....... .... 34.00

While the average for the nation 


is $100 and several states reach $150. 
Everybody knows that in the states 
above the expense of Negro schools 
does not reach $20 and yet the great 
United States Bureau of Education 
has not got the guts to learn and tell 
the truth about it. 


THE HOUSE OF THE BLACK 
BURGHARDTS 

F one slips out the Northern neck 
_of Manhattan and flies to the left 
of the silver Sound, one swoops in 
time onto the Golden River; and 
dodging its shining beauty, now right, 
now left, one comes after a hundred 
miles of lake, hill and mountain, in 
the Old Bay State. Then at the foot 
of high Mt. Everett one takes a sol- 
emn decision: left is sweet, old Shef- 
field; but pass it stolidly by and slip 
gently right into tiny South Egre- 
mont which always sleeps. Then 
wheel right again and come to Egre- 
mont Plain and the House of the Black 
Burghardts. 

It is the first home that I remember. 
There my mother was born and all 
her nine brothers and sisters. There 
perhaps my grandfather was born, al- 
though that I do not know. At any 
rate, on this wide and lovely plain, 
beneath the benediction of grey-blue 
mountain and the low music of rivers, 
lived for a hundred years the black 
Burghardt clan. Up and to the east 
on a hill of rocks was Uncle Ira; down 
and to the south was Uncle Harlow 
in a low, long, red house beside a 
pond—in a house of secret passages, 
sudden steps, low, narrow doors and 
unbelievable furniture. And _ here 
right in the center of the world was 
Uncle ‘Tallow, as Grandfather 
Othello was called. 

It was a delectable place—simple, 
square and low, with the great room 
of the fireplace, the flagged kitchen, 
half a step below, and the lower wood- 
shed beyond. Steep, strong stairs led 
up to Sleep, while without was a 
brook, a well and a mighty elm. Al- 
most was I born there myself but that 
Alfred Du Bois and Mary Burghardt 
honeymooned a year in town and then 
brought me as a baby back to Egre- 
mont Plain. 

I left the home as a child to live in 
town again and go to school. But

fore furtive glimpses I did not see the 
house again for more than a quarter 
century. Then riding near on a 
chance journey I suddenly was home- 
sick for that house. I came to the 
spot. There it stood, old, lonesome, 
empty. Its windowless eyes stared 
blindly on the broad, black highway 
to New York. It seemed to have 
shrunken timidly into itself. It had 
lost color and fence and grass and up 
to the left and down to the right its 
sister homes were gone —dead and 
gone with no stick nor stone to mark 
their burial. 

From that day to this I desperately 
wanted to own that house for no 
earthly reason that sounded a bit like 
sense. It was 130 long miles from 
my work. It was decrepit almost be- 
yond repair save that into its tough 
and sturdy timbers the Black Burg- 
hardts had built so much of their own 
dumb pluck that— 

“Why the stairs don’t even creak!” 
said She, climbing gingerly aloft. 

But I fought the temptation away. 
Yachts and country estates and limou- 
sines are not adapted to my income. 
Oh, I inquired of course. The re- 
plies were discouraging. And once 
every year or so I drove by and stared 
sadly; and even more sadly and brok- 
enly the House of the Black Burg- 
hardts stared back. 

Then of a sudden Somebody whose 
many names and places I do not know 
sent secret emissaries to me on a birth- 
day which I had firmly resolved not 
to celebrate. Sent emissaries who 
showed me all the Kingdoms of this 
World, including something in green 
with a cupola; and also The House; 
and I smiled at the House. And they 
said by telegram—““The House of the 
Black Burghardts is come home again 
—it is yours!” 

Whereat in great joy I celebrated 
another birthday and drew plans. 
And from its long, hiding place I 
brought out an old black pair of tongs. 
Once my grandfather, and mayhap 
his, used them in the great fireplace 
of the House. Long years I have car- 
ried them tenderly over all the earth. 
The sister shovel, worn in holes, was 
lost. But when the old fireplace rises 
again from the dead on Egremont 
Plain, its dead eves shall see not only 
the ghosts of old Tom and his son 
Jack and his grandson Othello and 
his great grandson, me—but also the 
real presence of these iron tongs rest- 
ing again in fire worship in the House 


of the Black Burghardts. 


l PROTEST 


WISH to enter a protest against 
the carelessness being used by Negro 
editors and Negro authors in writing 


134 


the name of Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
With greater and greater frequency 
in newspapers, magazines and even 
books by Negroes the middle name of 
the poet is being written Lawrence. 
There were few things that irritated 
Paul Laurence Dunbar more than to 
have anyone write his middle name 
with a “w” instead of a “u”. 

I wish to protest also against the 
use of the word “Aframerican” in a 
derisive and burlesque sense. I have 
a somewhat personal interest and pride 
in this word because I was, I think, 
the first American writer to use the 
term. I used it in the preface to “The 
Book of American Negro Poetry” to 
designate in a general way the poets 
of colored blood of North America, 
South America and the West Indies. 
Sir Harry Johnson used it in the same 
sense before I did. It is a needed term 
and besides is practical and scienti- 
fically correct. It ought not to be 
degraded by being used as a synonym 
for “darkey”, “blackamoor”, “dinge” 
and such words for the sake of “smart 
Alec” writing. 

James WELDON JOHNSON. 


San Jose, California, 


February 7, 1928. 
EAR SIR: 


In response to your notice that 
my subscription thas expired, I am en- 
closing check for renewal. 

I am a member of the local N. A. 
A. C. P. and am working actively with 
them, and it has been in my mind for 
a long time to write to THE CrisIs 
and make some criticism of its policies 
and content. 

It has seemed to me that it is en- 
tirely too “high-brow” a magazine for 
general appeal. Our group here is 
entirely working-class, and while some 
of them subscribe, I doubt if any of 
them read much of it, or understand 
in the least the scholarly satire of its 
editorials. These seem to me to be 
addressed to a very limited group of 
Negroes and white liberals. 

The workers do understand your 
protests against lynching and other out- 
rages, and from your notes and photo- 
graphs, know that there are success- 
ful bankers, business-men and artists 
and attractive looking girls, and this 
may give them a certain vicarious sat- 
isfaction, appealing to their race van- 
ity. But does it not accomplish ex- 
actly what the white papers (I should 
say “yellow”) accomplish when they 
laud American enterprise, rouse na- 
tional vanity, and make the workers 
believe that all may become million- 
aires and presidents? In other words, 
lull their discontent and resentment 
and make them easier to deal with 
and suppress? I think it does. 


When one of your prominent intel- 
lectuals rises in public conference with 
whites and appeals to them to give 
“us” social equality and ‘we’ will 
deal with our masses, this attitude 
reaches its himit. I think THE Crisis 
should repudiate such an appeal, and 
realize and emphasize the fact—for jt 
is a fact—that your intellectuals them- 
selves will never receive social recogni- 
tion while the economic necessity ex- 
ists for keeping the races hostile. They 
must fight side by side with the work- 
ers. 

The Editor is frankly sympathetic 
with Russian conditions and the race 
equality that exists in Russia, and must 
understand that it is only the Russian 
economic change that has made these 
conditions posstble; yet he himself 
tacitly excludes workers from impor- 
tant committees, and THe Crisis-prac- 
tically excludes labor discussions from 
its pages. 

I do not believe THe Crisis can 
afford an uncompromising working- 
class attitude, but I do think this na- 
tional organ should recognize that 
something like 98 per cent of the race 
are workers, and that advancement 
does not mean for them a rising out 
of their class to become bankers and 
oil well owners, or even artists and 
teachers. I think it should be recog- 
nized that Negro bankers and intel- 
lectuals will deal with their working- 
class just as the white bankers and 
intellectual prostitutes deal with the 
white workers. Note that when the 
Negro porters become too strong, and 
the movement could not be killed, Ne- 
gro bourgeoisie joined with A. F. L. 
“fakirs” to control the movement. 

The Negro organ should at least 
appeal to the understanding and to 
the interest of the 98 per cent, and 
should address its editorials to these. 
Only so can you build up a mass-or- 
gan, and only so can you stimulate 
your masses to fight their own fight-- 
and yours—with you. 

Sincerely yours, 
ANNA PorTER. 

P.S. There should be constant stress 
laid on the organization of Negroes 
as workers, and affiliation with white 
workers. 

I can hardly expect you to publish 
this, but I should be very glad if you 
would and get a discussion with your 
subscribers, letting each give his eco- 
nomic status. I am white bourgeois 
“intellectual”, no occupation. 


After all which is the Greater Life 
—the Finer World? A world full of 
real problems—a life terribly in ear- 
nest with Danger and Death; or 4 
world carefully upholstered, with God 
tempering the winds filled with mat- 
ters only transient and make-believe!

number enrolled in such districts. The 
poor comparative showing is made de- 
spite the fact that the independent dis- 
tricts are in session more days during 
the school year with more opportunities 
offered for absence. Many causes for 
such showing may be assigned, such as: 
longer distances over muddy roads in 
rural districts; sidewalks and shorter 
distances in independent districts; the 
greater variety and larger amount of 
work done by rural children at home; 
the more attractive school environ- 
ment in the towns and the cities; bet- 
ter prepared teachers required of in- 
dependent districts; larger groups of 
children of the same age and attain- 
ments in the larger schools, making it 
possible to engage in more school ac- 
tivities and to offer a greater variety 
of courses; and the system of promo- 
tion to the next higher grade which 
induces better attendance. ‘These and 
other causes are responsible for the 
poor attendance in rural districts and 
the better record made by children in 
the independent districts.” 


HE fact that Negro attendance 

is even lower than for whites de- 
mands some explanation. Of the fac- 
tors referred to above as affecting 
regularity of attendance, the matter 
of child labor on the farms, as well as 
attractiveness of program, probably 
represent the differential suggested 
here, though probably all of these cir- 
cumstances affect the Negro schools 
more largely than they do the white 
schools. 

It is discouraging to note from our 
data that average daily attendance fig- 
ures have not shown an increase in 
Oklahoma during the last three years. 
It is also strikingly evident that coun- 
ties in which the average daily at- 
tendance is below 50% that there is 
no possibility of doing efficient work. 
Attention is particularly directed to 
Tillman county, with an average daily 
attendance of 44%. Reference to the 
tables showing per capita expenditures 
will indicate that Tillman county is 
among the group of counties with an 
exceedingly low per capita expenditure. 


Sum mary 

ONDITIONS of attendance upon 

the schools of Oklahoma main- 
tained for Negro youth show little im- 
provement in the three year period 
represented by the state report of 1922- 
1923 and the present survey for the 
year 1925-1926. 

Attendance figures show such dis- 
gracefully low averages for most of 
the counties of the state that it is ob- 
vious that many children are receiv- 
ing but little profit from their irregu- 
lar attendance. The urban districts

surpass the rural districts in this re- 
spect, although there is a wide varia- 
tion here, likewise. 

The basic factors responsible for 
this condition lie in the inherent na- 
ture of rural life and the necessities 
of seasonal occupation and employment 
of child labor upon the cotton farms. 
That these conditions might be modi- 
fied, however, by consolidation of 
schools, by increased salaries, and by 
longer school terms, is very evident 
from comparisons with data showing 
the better school attendance obtaining 
in the cities. 


Matthew Anderson 
(Continued from page 117) 


the reach of his power that he was 
not always willing to do for them. 
And, even to those who were not, in 
any special sense his friends, he was 
always ready, when opportunity pre- 
sented itself, to show them a kindness. 

He was a splendid specimen of a 
man physically—large, robust, well 
proportioned, every inch a man. His 
physical and mental vigor was remark- 
able. It was really wonderful what 
he could do, the pace at which he 
could keep going, day in and day out, 
week in and week out, month in and 
month out, year in and year out. Only 
latterly, and once in a while, I have 
seen his strength wavering, seeming 
to be growing less; but even at such 
times, he has been able by sheer force 
of will to carry himself through what- 
ever he had in hand. I used to mar- 
vel, at times, as I looked at him, espe- 


cially latterly, as he was advancing in 
age, getting up towards four score, at 
the energy which he displayed. He 
never seemed to realize the fact that 
he was growing old, that his Life’s 
task was drawing to a close. The 
thought of dying seemed never to have 
crossed his mind. He was all the time 
planning, not to die, but to live. He 
had work, she said, the last time I 
talked with him, that he wanted to 
do, and that it would require at least 
fifteen more years to do it. So that 
when death came to him, it found his 
mind, his heart, his whole being taken 
up with the thought, not of rest, but 
of work, work, hard, hard, work. In 
this respect, unlike Hezekiah, his 
wishes were not to be gratified. But 
he had done enough, his task was fin- 
ished, and a noble task it was, cover- 
ing many years and involving the most 
strenuous toil, often under most dis- 
couraging conditions. But he never 
faltered; he was pressing on with 
firm and abiding faith in God, that 
he would not be allowed to fail in the 
work which he had undertaken. And 
he did not fail. God was back of him, 
and raised up for him all along the 
way, a host of true and tried friends 
who encouraged him by their words 
and by their financial aid. 


NE of the most notable things 

about his career in this city, is 
the large number of the very highest 
type of white citizens that he won as 
his friends and that he held firmly to 
the end. The very last time that I 
talked with him, one of the things that 


‘I charged him to do, was to make a

Why Should This Be So? 


Fv the year 1927, six thousand two hundred and fifty-three people paid for a total of 





$6,980,882.00 of life insurance with this Company but at the same time two thousand 
five hundred and fifty-nine people discontinued payment of premiums and allowed 
policies to lapse amounting to $2,699,587.00. This means that we had to work fully 
four months of the year, pay some $80,000.00 in expenses, without making any progress at 
all. One-third of the year to catch up with lapses—only eight months to go forward! We 
do not believe our record is exceptional for companies doing business with Colored People. 


Some of these lapses are natural—people lose their jobs; misfortune comes to take the money 
that might go to pay premiums. Some of these lapses are our fault—agents are over- 
anxious; persuade people to “sign on the dotted line” when they are not able to meet the 
payments regularly thereafter; sell the more expensive policy when the lower premium is all 
the policyholder can pay. We try to correct these mistakes when the lapses occur, but that 
is often too late. 


By far the greatest portion of these lapses occur in the first policy year—People are indif- 
ferent about the fact that they lose the money already paid, drop their life insurance at 
the first pretext to join something else. Many of them apply for new policies in six months 
or a year and go through the same process again. This is very expensive for the Company. 


These people believe in Life Insurance but they fail to realize that an Ordinary Life Insur- 
ance Policy, unlike some other forms, is a cumulative saving. Like putting money into the 
bank, premium payments must be made regularly and continuously in order to have the 1 
values in the policy accumulate from year to year. The Life Insurance Company has to 
reserve these savings and pay the policyholder interest on the accumulating amounts. 


Many people like to play with fire. Our Company is young but hardly a week goes by 
without a letter from some relative of one of these lapsed policyholders—dead—trying to col- | 
lect the insurance. The letter we have to send them doesn’t lessen the heartache any, neither 
can it help to clothe the children during the cold winter months. 





Maybe this doesn’t apply to you, but you can keep our most serious problem in mind, and 
help us instruct those who need instruction.

April, 1928 


list of the many white friends of promi- 
nence that he had made—lawyers, doc- 
tors, bankers, merchants, manufactur- 
ers, ministers, public officials. 1 don’t 
know whether that list was ever made 
or not. I was anxious for it, because 
I felt that it would be the strongest 
evidence of the place which he occu- 
pied in the confidence of the best peo- 
ple in this city where he has lived and 
wrought for half a century. I think 
of the Clarks, father and sons, of Mr. 
Webb, of Mr. John Wanamaker, of 
the Disstons, of the Cramps, of the 
Hoggs, of Mr. John Converse, Judge 
Ashman, Colonel McClure, Mr. John 
McGill, Mr. Ogden, Dr. Floyd 
Tompkins, Hon. George S. Graham, 
and a long list of others that might 
be added. When you think of the fact 
that he won and kept the confidence 
and respect of such men and women, 
I know of nothing that speaks more 
favorably of him and of his work than 
that simple fact. The best white peo- 
ple of the community thought well of 
him, gave of their means to help sup- 
port the work in which he was en- 
gaged. It will be impossible, at this 
time, to appraise properly the work 
that he has done in all its bearings and 
relations. We know, however, that 
he has left behind him institutions and 
influences that will go on making them- 
selves felt for good, long after these 
funeral ceremonies have passed away. 
Matthew Anderson has left his im- 
press here that time will not be able 
to efface. In the years to come, as we 
look at these buildings and these beau- 
tiful grounds, we will think of him: 
his spirit will be ever about this place; 
we, who have known him, and have 
seen him in and about these premises, 
ever concerned about keeping them at- 
tractive and beautiful, will never be 
able to come here without thinking 
of the man who created all this and 
who has kept it fresh and beautiful 
all these years; and it will continue to 
be kept so, as long as his spirit abides 
here. I am sure we will not forget 
him, or forget the many years of pa- 
tient toil that he thas bestowed upon 
this work which was ever near to his 
heart. 

Fifty years ago, four of us were in 
Princeton Theological Seminary to- 
gether—Hugh M. Browne, Daniel 
W. Culp, Matthew Anderson and my- 
self. Anderson graduated in 1877, 
Browne and myself in 1878, and Culp 
in 1879. Culp was the first to go; 
then followed Browne, and now An- 
derson has joined the procession. I 
alone am left of the four. Anderson 
and myself were very close friends 
and it was always my thought, in case 
I should survive him, to be present 
at his obsequies, and say over him the 
parting word. But, I am deeply sorry

She was testifying. 

“Up Calvary’s rugged brow did I

Thy precious feet the cruel

drops of rain pelted her in gentle bene-
