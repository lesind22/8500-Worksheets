Southern Aid Society 
of Va., Inc. 


has through the liberal patronage 
of old policyholders and the in- 
suring public abundant evidence 
of the wisdom of its step in adding 
Industrial Life Insurance to its 
Future Home Office : : 
a Aid Society of Va., Inc. line of very popular and superior 


W. Cor. 3rd & Clay St : sa 
—=a. 3-in-1 disability contracts. 


The amount of life insurance written since January |, 1930, 
under the Whole Life, Twenty Payment Life and Twenty Year 
Endowment Policies has been far in excess of the expectations of 
the officers of this company, and they likewise have been gratified 
at the persistency of the business written and the care which the 
field staff has exercised in selecting risks; that is, lapses on such 
business have been light and clairzs negligible. 


The company is thus rendering at this time a far larger service 
to race people over its territory than at any other period of the 
thirty-eight continuous years of its operation. Claim payments under 
its 3-in-1 disability Policies have been a bulwark to tens of thou- 
sands of race people and homes during the winter period, and despite 
the general depression and lack of employment no policyholder of 


this company has had to look to or accept charity in the hour of 
Sickness, Accident or Death.

A Paul Robeson would scare Phil- As the Crow Flies 

adelphia—Dr. Langmuir says that we _ ‘i 

cannot find out what the atom is really acpenmmrenena mamas 

like. It makes up matter and matter Boston. Let’s get them.—The new 


is an “abstraction”. Shades of Kant, 
Hegel, Royce, and William James!— 
We Americans are so fast and busy 
that we kill ninety fellow-citizens with 
our automobiles every day. What 
land can beat our efficiency ?—In 
England, 1,739,500 people are out of 
work. In Germany, 2,500,000 are 
out of work. In the United States, 
we don’t know.—Talk about being 
slick, that business of stealing the 
Dodges’ expense accounts from Poiret 
and facing them with it at the Cus- 
tom’s dock, caps the climax.—England 
and Egypt cannot agree on the owner- 
thip of the Sudan, and economically 
the Sudan dominates Egypt. There- 
fore, England and Egypt cannot agree 
on the ownership of Egypt.—And now 
for another witch hunt. The Reds 
and Yellows and Pinks are undermin- 
ing morality in these United States. It 
is suspected that they are responsible 
for the lynching in Texas, the primary 
in Pennsylvania, and the censorship in 


tariff is almost ready. It will raise the 
cost of chickens 10c, potatoes 75c, 
beef 6c, sugar 2c, and your whole 
grocery bill $28 a year. In return for 
this, we will have enough more mil- 
lionaires to raise the average ot 
wealth far above France, England or 
Germany. Persons who don’t like this 
country can get out.—Mussolini is 
playing the Bull in the European china 
shop: “Down with France,” “Up 
with the Roman Empire,” and “To 
Hell with everybody!” seems to be his 
bright and alluring program. The 
Italians are cheering themselves 
hoarse.—Aristide Briand has planned 
a Pan-Europe to offset the Monroe 
Doctrine, Russia and Pan-Asia. It is 
a big idea but Italy won’t play. And 
England is waiting for the cat to 
jump.—All hail Eugene Roy, the new 
President of Haiti—Black hands 
buried the putrid bodies of white 
American soldiers in France. Black 
mothers cannot go with white mothers

The August Crisis will be our 
19th Education Number. We want 
the records of all colored college 
graduates in the United States. We 
want the photographs of any of 
those who have achieved distinc- 
tion in their college course. We 
want the photographs of all who 
have received the higher degrees of 
Master of Arts or Doctor of Phil- 
osophy. Do not wait for us to 
write you. Write us. This is the 
most important educational record 
of the year.

to look at their graves.—France gives 
Syria a Constitution with president 
and parliament. Great Britain re- 
buffs the Arabs and shoots the Indians. 
—The monopoly of the air under the 
Radio Corporation of America is 
about complete. The United States 
Government has just heard about it.— 
Jew-baiting in Rumania has arisen to 
the dimensions of a major sport.— 
Golden Samarkand has been linked to 
Russia, not only with a thousand miles 
of railroad, but with education and 
fair play.—Fritjof Nansen of the Arc- 
tic is dead. He might have been a 
mere King.—We are not beginning to 
crow, but we rise to remark that Mr. 
Grundy of Pennsylvania voted to con- 
firm Judge Parker and in the ensuing 
primary, he lost the senatorial nom- 
ination to Davis by 250,000 votes. 
Also, there are in Pennsylvania by our 
own private census, something in the 
neighborhood of 250,000 Negro voters. 
—With steamships carrying from two 
to three thousand immigrants at $50 a 
head they made enough profit to pay 
for the luxuries of first class passen- 
gers; and that goes not only for steam- 
ships, but for most of the luxuries of 
this world.—And two thousand years

Crisis 





N March 21, 1930, _ President 

Hoover sent to the Senate for 
confirmation the nomination of John 
Johnston Parker of North Carolina, 
Circuit Judge of the United States 
Court, Fourth Circuit, to be Asso- 
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court of 
the United States. The Senate con- 
sidered this confirmation from April 
72 to May 6. Protests were made by 
the American Federation of Labor and 
the N. A. A. C. P., and various Sena- 
tors voiced opposition. On the other 
hand, strong commendation of Judge 
Parker was made by many Northern 
and Southern newspapers and by the 
Senators of his own state, both of 
whom were Democrats, while he was 
a Republican. Other interests and 
persons commended him. On April 
21 the Judiciary Committee reported 
adversely on confirmation, 10 to 6. 
The question came to a vote in the 
Senate May 7, and confirmation was 
refused. There follows a story of the 
reaction which this rejection has had, 
as voiced by editorials in the press of 
the country. 

The scene in the Senate on the day 
of voting was significant. 

“Only those in the Senate at the time,” 
says the Wichita, Kans., Eagle, “realized 
to the full the electric atmosphere which 
surrounded the Parker rollcall. Not in 
years has there been in either House a 
more palpitating session. Every vote 
counted. As each Senator voiced his sen- 
timent by the simple word which cast the 
die, a separate story was suggested. For 
instance, this was the case when Blease, 
the South Carolina fire-eater, cast the 
first Democratic vote for Parker who 
had berated the Negro race. So on down 
the list each vote was pregnant with sig- 
nificance, involving in almost all the votes 
cast the indivdual’s deepest and often un- 
expressed convictions of the fundamentals 
of the Republic.” 

The result of that vote is now well- 
known, Judge Parker was refused 
confirmation by a vote of 41 to 39. 
In addition, there were 8 Senators 
paired in favor, and 8 paired against 
him, making the total choice of the 


Senate 47 in favor and 49 against.

O what was this decision mainly 

due? On this point there is na- 
turally difference of opinion. On the 
whole, the strongest opinion both of 
reporters and newspaper editors is that 
the vote was due more to the influence 
of the Negro than to any other single 
factor. The Montgomery, Ala., Ad- 
vertizer, expresses a widespread judg- 
ment: 

The National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People laid John 
Johnson Parker low. He had other effec- 
tive opposition, but it was this organiza- 
tion that broke his back. Judge Parker is 
a Lily White Republican from a southern 
state, and the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People has 
long been hostile to Lily Whitism. 

The Chicago, IIll., News, says: 

“Perhaps the most striking feature of 
the Senate’s action, all things considered, 
is the proof it affords that the constitu- 
tional rights of the Negroes iare not to be 
treated lightly by any citzen who aspires 
to federal honors. It may be said, indeed, 
that the rejection of Judge Parker has 
advanced the colored race _ politically 
throughout the country.” 

The New York Evening Post says 
in an editorial entitled “A Negro Re- 
jection”. 

“To us it seems that the Negro issue 
was the decisve consideration. The other 
issues entered into the case. They swayed 
their various blocs of votes. But the 
threat of the organized Negro vote was 
the influence that swayed enough ‘regu- 
lar’ Republicans to defeat confirmation.” 

The Christian Science Monitor calls 
this vote “The first national demon- 
stration of the Negro’s power since 
Reconstruction days.” But the Topeka, 
Kansas, Capital, reminds us that the 
nomination of Judge Hook of Kansas 
was withdrawn by President Taft be- 
cause of the opposition of Negro 
voters, 

The Springfield, Mass., News says 
that the Negroes “made a brave fight 
and their victory is a handsome one”, 
while the President of Lincoln Uni- 
versity reminds the New York Eve- 
ning Post that this situation, as con- 
trasted with Chief Justice Taney’s 
decision in 1857, “is a striking illus- 
tration of the remarkable and rapid 
progress of the Negro.” 


HAT there were other elements 

in the defeat of Judge Parker is 
manifest, and some papers emphasize 
these. There was, for instance, the 
opposition of organized labor; there 
was the fear of Southern Democrats 
that this nomination would tend 
further to disrupt the Solid South; 


225 





































































































and there was the determination of the 
West to liberalize the Supreme Court. 
All these motives had influence. And 
yet, it was the Negro influence which 
curiously enough in the end solidified 
the opposition. For instance, the cor- 
respondent of the New York Outlook 
writes: 

“The strangest and most significant 
feature of the protest against Judge 
Parker is that labor’s voice has fallen on 
deaf ears. For all the effect Mr. Green’s 
critcism is having, he might never have 
made it. It is the resentment of the col- 
ored race against Parker’s remarks anent 
their unreadiness to bear the burdens and 
responsibilities of the ballot that led 
goose-step Republicans to get out of line 
with their President.” 

The liberal West voted largely 
against Parker, but it was not moved 
by the Negro issue. It is significant 
that Borah, who once attacked the 
15th Amendment, in his opposition to 
Parker said not a single word on the 
Negro issue. Of all the voters, the 
Southern Senators were evidently the 
most embarassed. ‘They were literally 
between the Devil and the Deep Sea. 
If they voted for Parker, they were 
voting against the Solid South; if they 
voted against him, they were voting 
in-favor of the Negro. They had to 
decide, therefore, which thing they 
feared most. It is significant to note 
that the Border States, Kentucky and 
Tennessee, joined with Georgia and 
Alabama and the whole (Southwest 
bevond the Mississippi, in voting to 
uphold the Solid South against 
Hoover's assault, despite the fact that 
this vote encouraged the political 
power of the Negro. On the other 
hand, the Eastern Border States, to- 
gether with the Carolinas, Florida, 
Mississippi and Louisiana, said by 
their vote that they feared the Negro 
more than the disruption of the Solid 
South by Hoover and the Lily Whites. 
Whichever way these Senators voted, 
it was a bitter pill, and the repercus- 
sions in the Southern press are evident. 
The Norfolk, Va., Leger-Dispatch, 
cries out in indignation: 

Is it conceivakle that any Southern 
Senator will let himself be dictated to by 
the National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People, on such a 
question as the selection of a man to sit 
on the bench of the Supreme Court of 
the United States? Is there a single 
Southern Senator who did not agree with 
Judge Parker—Republican though he 
was—when he said ten years ago that the 
Negro had not then reached the stage of 
development when he could “share the 
burdens and responsibilities of govern- 
ment’? Is there a Southern Senator who 
is cringing enough to let himself be 
whipped into line by Oscar De Priest 
and James Weldon Johnson? 

If there is any such Senator, then God 
help the cause of justice in the United 
States and God help the South and God 

. 


226 





help the country! Justice and fair treat- 
ment for the Negroes? Yes—a thousand 
times, yes. Let the Negroes decide who 
shall and who shall not sit on the bench 
of the Supreme Court? No! A million 
times, no! 

If any Southern Senator is fool enough 
to oppose confirmation of Judge Parker 
in order to embarrass the President of 
the United States, or because he is afraid 
of any organization of and for Negroes, 
then let him perish in his folly! 

Other papers explain the vote in 
various ways, although admitting that 
the Negro issue had some weight. 
The New York World, which is 
afraid to support the 15th Amendment 
because of its attitude toward the 
18th, tries to stress the unfitness of 
Parker for the office. 

The Chicago Journal of Commerce 
admits that ‘Negroes scared off some 
Senators,” but declares that this was 
balanced by the adherence of half the 
Southern Democrats; and that the 
failure of confirmation was due prin- 
cipally to the radical attack upon 
Parker’s conservatism. But Kent of 
the Baltimore Sun notes a fact clear 
to many; namely, that the under- 
lying reason for the combined oppo- 
sition to Parker did not come out in 
the debate, and that that reason was 
the Negro issue. 


O much for the explanation of the 

matter. How now have the re- 
sults been received? In the past any 
political victory won by Negroes has 
resulted in reaction and even bitter 
resentment on the part of numbers of 
whites. Something of this spirit is 
manifest in the Parker case. But on 
the whole, the attitude of a large num- 
ber of conservative Americans is ex- 
pressed by the New York Times, and 
the net result of their verdict is: that 
there was something shameful in 
United States Senators allowing them- 
selves to be influenced by the thrvat 
of the Negro vote! 

The Times says: 

No principle is at stake. Only a politi- 
cal self-interest is driving on these Re- 
publican Senators. Full in the eye of the 
public they write’ themselves down as 
what they are—men afraid of doing any- 
thing to injure their own chances at the 
polls, even if they know it to be the right 
thing to do. Compared with them the 
Negro agitators, hot on their trail, are 
straightforward and honorable. 


The New York Times editorial was 
widely quoted. The Richmond T'imes 
Dispatch commented on “the rank 
cowardice of those who feared the 
Negro vote.” The Hartford Courant 
sneered at those who feared the poli- 
tical consequences “of incurring the 
displeasure of the unions and the poli- 
tically organized Negroes.” 


The Charlotte Observer talked of 











“A lot of timid Senators at Washing. 
ton” whom Negroes could “frighten,” 
The New York Sun called these 
Senators “cheap politicians” and the 
fight “‘pitiable.” To the Memphis 
Commercial-A ppeal the whole affair 
was “sordid”. 

Such opinions must be matters of 
grave reflection to the Negro, for they 
show the persistence of the extraordip- 
ary doctrine that no representative of 
the people has a right to defer to the 
wishes of his Negro constituents. 

Let us examine this doctrine. If we 
admit that Negroes are men, then it 
was unjustifiable for Senators to 
follow the views of Negro voters only 
in case those views were wrong. If 
the demands of Negroes with regard 
to Judge Parker were unreasonable or 
petty they should not have prevailed, 
At first, this was widely assumed. 
There was a brave chorus that Parker 
had never denied the right of a Negro 
te vote. Local North Carolina papers, 
and particularly the Greensboro News, 
denied that they had ever printed or 
seen such a speech. Papers throughout 
the country took up the denial, Other 
papers distorted Parker words: the 
Memphis Commercial-A ppeal — said 
that Parker had ‘“‘merely declined to 
fraternize with Negroes.” The 
Chicago Journal of Commerce said 
that “He refused to drum up the 
Negro vote and employ it as an or- 


ganized = mass.” The — Cincinnati 
Times-Star calls the speech ‘‘a casual 
remark.” 


Nevertheless the Parker speech of 
1920 was found in the Greensboro 
News and re-published. It’s clear 
meaning was: 


A. He believed in the disfranchise- 
ment of Negroes. 

B. That no Negro had ever sat in 

a state Republican convention 

that he had attended. 

That Negroes did not wish to 

enter politics. 

D. That the Republican Party did 
not wish the Negro to vote. 

E. That the participation of the 
Negro in politics is a source of 
evil and danger. 


After this revelation, the papers 
continued to misquote Parker. Even 
the New York Times said that Parker 
had denied the fitness of the Negro 
“to hold high office,” and the Cin- 
cinati, Times-Star, said that he had 
merely questioned the Negro’s “po 
litical capacity.” The Norfolk, Va. 
Pilot, asserted that the Supreme Court 
by its decisions agreed with what 
Parker said. 

Judge Parker himself in explaining 
his position said that his remarks had 
been “misinterpreted.” He did not 
deny that the report of his speech was

-orrect, and he did not 


substantially corre 
say that he had in any way changed 


his point of view. Heywood Broun 
put the matter to him this way: 
yur letter to this commit- 


You say in | alc ale 
rou have “ rejudice whatever 
tee that you have “no prejudice ssibl 
against the colored people”; is it possible 
gains 


to maintain that the members of a certain 
e of evil and danger in 


race are a sour 

politics, but thar, just the same, you have 
no prejudice against them? Judge 
Parker, do you understand the meaning 
of ordinary English words in common 
usage? Can you define “prejudice ? Can 


you tell us what you mean by “state- 
ments alleged to have been made” ? 

On the other hand, most papers, 
North and South, frankly acknowl- 
edged that Judge Parker's speech ex- 
pressed not ons his own opinion but 
that of the whole South. 

The New York World says that 
his view is the view “of nearly all 
white voters in the South.” And the 
Brooklyn Citizen agrees with it. The 
Winston-Salem, N. C., Journal is 
forthright and says: 

Instead of apologizing for such views 
as these, Judge Parker should reiterate 
and emphasize them. If he cannot go to 
the Supreme Court holding this opinion 
on the Negro in politics in the South, 
then most assuredly the South does not 
want him to go there. The South would 
prefer no representation by one who is so 
unwise as to think that re-entrance of 
Negroes into politics in the South would 
be best for the country and for the Ne- 
gro race. A man believing that, might 
represent Illinois, but he could only mis- 
represent the South. 

In this view the Southern papers are 
practically unanimous. 

Many Northern papers admit the 
perfect right of the Negroes to object. 
The New York World says: 

Opposition to Judge Parker’s nomina- 
tion is not capricious. It is not political 
except in the sense that politicians are 
sometimes required to consult the temper 
of their constituents. 

The Brooklyn Eagle adds: 

The opposition of the Negro vote 
where it is cast and counted are 
not things which any party as a 
party can afford to regard as negli- 
gible. There Judge Parker has a 
handicap which Hughes did not suffer 
from. When the chairman of the Re- 
publican organization in Missouri writes 
of the nomination as an affront given by 
a Republican President to the Negro 
race, and of confirmation as compelling 
the Republican party to “say goodby to 
Missouri,” he is not misunderstood. 

Even the Chicago Daily Tribune 
whose long hostility to Negroes in poli- 
tics is well-known, says: 

Not merely the enactment of the 13th, 
14th, and 15th amendments but their ju- 
dicial Interpretation are facts of first 
tank importance in American history, 
and at this moment, apart from the 
questions involved in the 18th amend- 
ment and its enforcement, two other 


July, 1930 








great questions confront the Supreme 
Court—that of the abuse of injunction 
procedure and that of Negro equality. 
These all raise issues of political and so- 
cial character as momentous as any, per- 
haps, in the history of the republic, and 
they will not and cannot be treated as if 
they were problems in mathematics. 


N the South, naturally, there were 

two reactions: first, an attempt to 
find Negroes who were satisfied with 
Judge Parker’s attitude, and secondly 
to threaten mob violence. Only two 
Negroes of any prominence were 
found in North Carolina who would 
say a good word for Parker, and even 
these two did not say very much. The 
Negro papers, North and South, stood 
back of the N. A. A. C. P. almost 
unanimously. Indeed, there has sel- 
dom been such agreement among col- 
ored papers in the history of Negro 
journalism. Even the Chicago Whip 
agreed, although it had to say: “We 
have no doubt that Judge Parker will 
be confirmed.” 

The South then resorted to threats; 
The venerable Senator Overman of 
North Carolina ejaculated, “If Judge 
Parker is rejected, Southern Negroes 
will accept it as due to their protests 
and become unruly.” 

A leading South Carolinan paper 
says: 

If Judge Parker’s nomination is de- 
feated, the Senate deferring to the de- 
mands of the Society for the Advance- 
ment of the Colored People, it will also 
be a signal defeat of the hopes and the 
labors of those men and women, white 
and colored, who have striven most 
earnestly for justice to the Negro, good 
will between the races where they dwell 
side by side, opening the door of hope to 
millions of black people. It will turn 
back the ebbing tide of prejudice. It 
would render greatly more difficult the 
prevention of violence, of terrorism, 
which have been in the past the fearful 
incidents of prejudice. Here is a sowing 
that may look to a sinister harvest, for 
both races, in this part of the country. 

Another North Carolinan paper 
“sees in this protest the seeds of vio- 
lence.” 

All of the North Carolinan papers 
are angry because the N. A. A. C. P. 
protested against efforts to compel 
Negroes to endorse Parker. They 
called the charge a “vicious false- 
hood ;” “disreputable politics,” ‘“gar- 
bage,” and a “low publicity stunt.” 


Beyond this, papers both North and 
South, agree that Southern judges are 
going to find confirmation impossible 
if Negro opposition is to be recognized. 

Even the New York Times says: 


“It will appear as if the Senate had 
established a rule that no man from the 
Southern States—no Southern Democrat 
—could ever be confirmed for a judge 
of the Supreme Court, for the Parker 
view is almost universal in the South.” 








The Kansas City Times says, “If inci- 
dental comment on Negro suffrage is to 
be a bar to the bench, the whole South 
probably would have to go unrepresented 
on the Supreme Court.” 

The Macon, Ga., Telegraph, re- 
membering doubtless how many more 
vacancies are imminent on the Supreme 
Bench, laments: 

The Southern senators who voted 
against Parker have succeeded in help- 
ing to establish, as a qualification for 
membership on the court, advocacy of 
full Negro participation in politics. Re- 
membering the fight on Judge Parker 
and the fact that he failed of confirma- 
tion, no president will dare, in the fu. 
ture, appoint a man whose views on the 
Negro question are not entirely satis- 
factory to the Association for Advance- 
ment of Colored People. 

The charge is then made that the 
Negro is after all, bluffing. The 
Washington Post calls not only the 
Negro vote, but the labor vote “mythi- 
cal”, The New Haven Journal- 
Courier intimates that with the all but 
unanimous vote of New England for 
Parker, there is “no fear on their part 
of either organization, Labor or the 
Negro.” It is pointed out by the 
Parkersburg, W. Va., News that the 
Negro vote had no influence on Sena- 
tor Fess. The Charleston, W. Va., 
Gazette says bluntly: 

It is not easy to treat seriously the 
reasons so far assigned for the opposition 
to Judge Parker. Any one familiar with 
the colored vote knows that his confirma- 
tion would not lose the Republican 50 
Negro votes in West Virginia. After all 
the claims of Negro support for Gov- 
ernor Smith, none of it appeared in the 
ballot box. The situation can not be dif- 
ferent in other states having Negro vot- 
ers. Democrats who get Negro votes 
know that they are few and come only 
on personal grounds. 

It is intimated by several West Vir- 
ginia papers that Senator Hatfield 
voted for Parker because he knows 
that Negroes have short memories and 
he doesn’t come up for re-election 
until 1934. Even Heywood Broun 
doubts if “Walter White could actu- 
ally have defeated any of the Senators 
against whom he threatened reprisals.” 


ONTRASTING with this re- 
peated accusation that Negroes are 
playing petty politics that may lead to 
mob violence, is the wide-spread asser- 
tion that if the Parker nomination was 
a matter of petty politics, it was 
Hoover that made it so. Heywood 
Broun says: 

All right, but where does President 
Hoover get off? Where do his support- 
ers get off? May they be reasonably ac- 
quitted of any taint of politics? I don’t 
think so. The President nominated an 
obscure and not notoriously competent 
young man from North Carolina for the

O MOST white folk it will be 
T news to know that south of 
Virginia on the Atlantic seaboard and 
on the Gulf Coast as far as Mexico, 
there is not a single organized resort 
where colored people are allowed to 
take a sea bath, with the single excep- 
tion of Gulfside. This makes Gulf- 
side, which is at Waveland in southern 
Mississippi, a place of more than usual 
importance to some eight million 
Americans. 

Gulfside is the spiritual child of 
Robert E. Jones, Bishop of the Meth- 
odist Episcopal Church, who has long 
been a resident of New Orleans. He 
is a colored man who has had a rather 
unusual career. In the first place, he 
is in appearance quite white, so much 
so that he was once threatened with 
arrest on the streets of a Southern 
city for walking with a colored woman! 
Nevertheless, when he was proposed 
for election as Bishop of the great 
Methodist Episcopal Church, the ques- 





Bishop Robert Jones 


tion of his “color” was a grave one, 
and one of the reasons that the Meth-

odist Episcopal Church South refuses to 
join with its Northern sister in chris. 
tian unity is because of the presence - 
the Episcopal bench of Bishop Jones 
and several other Bishops of Neoto 
descent. 

Bishop Jones was born in North 
Carolina in 1872; he was educated a 
Bennett College and Gammon Theo. 
logical Seminary, and served as pastor 
from 1892 until 1904, when he became 
the editor of the Southwestern Chris. 
tian Advocate. Here he worked fo; 
sixteen years until he was elected 
Bishop. He belongs to the conserva- 
tive wing of the Negroes and is neither 
aggressive nor self-assertive. He js 
widely acquainted with Southern white 
people and respected by them. As a 
result, he has been able to live in the 
South; to carry on his profession suc- 
cessfully, and to accomplish many 
things that a more aggressive or self- 
conscious Negro could never have done,

Crisis 








which may prove his greatest monu- 
ment, is Gulfside. Bishop Jones estab- 
lished it with the co-operation of Presi- 
dent Dogan ot Wiley College, the 


Reverends E. MI. Jones and William 
Jones of the M. E. Church, ye ae 
Shaw of Haven Teachers College and 
R. N. Brooks of Gammon Seminary. 
These men met in April, 1923, and 
laid down $4,000 tor the purchase of 
the property. Gulfside is on the Gulf 
of Mexico at a point known as Missis- 
sippi_ Sound, forty-eight miles from 
New Orleans, and just off the “Old 
Spanish Trail”. It contains 600 acres 
of great natural beauty, with a mile 
and a quarter of beach front. There 
is a luxuriant forest growth, with great 
trees and hanging moss, and originally 
there was one old mansion which it is 
said that Andrew Jackson once 
occupied. 

Gulfside was begun chiefly on the 
faith that the great and urgent need 
of an environment for wholesome rec- 
reation and group contacts among 
Negroes would guarantee its success. 
The time of its conception in the mind 
of Bishop Jones was opportune. Per- 
haps at any other time or by any other 
person the venture would have been 
a failure to start with; for desirable 
sea-side locations are usually preempted 
for use by white people. And it is 
said that but for the tactful methods 
employed in negotiating the deal at 
the time, the bishop’s dream would still 
be unrealized. 

The site is on the Louisville and 
Nashville Railroad, and is connected 
with the world by two of the best 
automobile roads of the South. 

A program of organization and con- 
struction was immediately called for. 
The old Jackson house was re-built 
into a hotel of twenty-five rooms, with 
wide verandas. It is surrounded by 
one of the finest clusters of live oaks 
on the Gulf Coast with branches in 
some instances extending out more than 
a hundred feet. Other buildings were 
erected: Forsyth Hall, which has class 
rooms, library, offices and an Assembly 
hall; Graff Hall, a dormitory; and 
several cottages. Money for this 
building program has been furnished 
by various philanthropists, including 
Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and 
Mr. Julius Rosenwald. 





Gulfside is not an Atlantic City nor 
an Idlewild. It is rather patterned on 
the educational and semi-religious re- 
sorts at Silver Bay, Lake Geneva, 
Northfield, and Winona Lake. How 
far the academic and religious aspect 
is going to hinder the recreation side, 
remains to be seen. On the other hand, 
the organized work and recreation of 
the resort will attract many persons 
who are otherwise repelled by the ex- 
cesses of the conventional summer play- 
ground. 

Gulfside is thought to be justifying 
the dream of its founder. Although 
practically an abandoned wild when 
title was secured to it, it has been 
transformed into what is conceded to 
be in every way an attractive and rap- 
idly growing enterprise contributing to 
the religious, educational and _ social 
development of the colored people in a 
very successful way. 

Here, during the open season—April 
to the middle of September—some type 
of beneficial activity is continually be- 
ing carried on. The summer program 
has been so enlarged and diversified 
as to make a strong appeal to the many 
progressive classes of Negroes through- 
out the South and even in other parts 
of the United States. The 1929 sea- 
son, said to be the most successful yet, 
was especially notable for the wide 
range of territory from which it drew 
the personnel both of speakers and 
auditors. 

Among the speakers were George E. 
Vincent, Chairman of the Rockefeller 
Foundation; Florence M. Reed, Presi- 
dent of Spelman College; Mordecai 
Johnson, President of Howard; Edwin 
R. Embree of the Rosenwald Fund; 
and a number of bishops and editors. 
In 1930, Gulfside expects Hugh 5S. 
Cumming, Surgeon-General of the 
United States Public Health Service 
and Colonel Ward of the Tuskegee 
Hospital.

side Association are herewith listed :

Besides this, there are receptions and 
social entertainments and a tea room. 
We have not been able to ascertain as 
to whether dancing is allowed, but as 
the theater has certainly entered, it is 
probably permitted. Also nothing is 
said of the Labor Problem! 

There is another aspect, too, which 
probably has been little thought of — 
at least we do not find it mentioned in 
the Gulfside literature: here is a great 
colored resort on the Gulf of Mexico; 
it looks straight down to a colored 
world,—Mexico and Central America, 
the Northern Coast of South America, 
Cuba and Jamaica, Haiti and Porto 
Rico. The day may come when large 
numbers of colored folk with common 
interests may exchange visits at Gulf- 
side and languages and compare ex- 
periences in a series of Afro-American 
Congresses. But, as we have said, this 
aspect has not yet been mentioned. 

Meantime, as its sponsors say: 

“Gulfside, within a few years, should 
become a mighty lever for the uplift 
of the race; and Bishop Jones is en- 
titled not only to the undivided support 
of our entire group in promoting this 
enterprise, but of the white people who 
rightly evaluate the wholesome influ- 
ence which it will have upon the religi- 
ous and moral life of the race.” 





More than 10,000 persons visited 
Gulfside last year. 


The General Education Board | 


= annual report of the General 
4 Education Board for 1928-29 
gives a sort of apologia pro sua vita, 


0 far as it concerns Negro education. 
It says: 


July, 1930 





“The improvement of Negro educa- 
tion has been from the first one of the 
principal objects of the General Educa- 
tion Board. The Board has no separate 
division for its work in Negro education; 
a separate report is made because of cer- 


tain features which have required a 
treatment differing from that which pre- 
vails in other phases of the Board’s 
work. 


“From the time of its organization in 
1902 to June 30, 1929, the total appro- 


229 







































































priations of the Board for Negro educa- 
tion have amounted to $20,986,576.62. 
The greater part of this sum has been 
expended since 1919.” 
It then goes on to explain why in 
the years from 1902-1919, its work 
for Negro education was so small, con- 
tradictory and lacking in tangible re- 
ults. The truth of the matter was 
that Robert Ogden, Wallace Buttrick 
and the Southern Education Board, 
surrendered entirely to the white 
South on the matter of Negro educa- 
tion and were especially taken into 
camp by certain professional Southern 
white liberals who talked with great 
fairness concerning educating Negroes 
but succeeded in turning the channels 
of philanthropy largely to the educa- 
tion of whites. They undertook espe- 
cially to restrain and starve Negro 
higher education and to concentrate 
upon what they regarded as the 
Hampton-Tuskegee industrial plan; 
they sneered at “Latin and Greek”, ac- 
cused educated Negroes of being 
“ashamed of their race”, and proposed 
to fill the South with non-union black 
artisans warranted never to vote nor 
strike and always to be happy. 


This, naturally, the present report 
of the General Education Board ex- 
plains quite differently, and has many 
pleasant words to say on these seven- 
teen years of misguided work; even 
for the “farm-demonstration” work by 
which Dr. Seaman Knapp proposed to 
revolutionize the rural South and in 
which he lamentably failed and has 
been suitably forgotten. 

However, gradually the policy of 
the General Education Board changed. 
They began to get upon their staff 
some Southern white men who were 
liberal, not only in talk but in deed, 
and the Board began with considerable 
reluctance but inevitable logic to help 
the Negro college. Their change in 
this last regard was a bitter pill for 
many of their older members, and it 
was not until several of these members 
died that comprehensive plans of Ne- 
gro education were entered into and 
the abortive attempt at exclusive in- 
dustrial training for Negroes was prac- 
tically surrendered. 

The present Report says: 

“Prior to 1919 the Board had not felt 
warranted in contributing to any consid- 
erable extent to the endowment of 
Negro colleges. A gift of $25,000 to 
Hampton Institute, in 1915, represents 
the only sum for this purpose. With 
the rising cost of living and maintenance, 
and all the complicated problems follow- 
ing the war, Negro colleges were in 
great difficulty. In administering a spe- 
_cial gift from Mr. John D. Rockefeller, 
designed primarily to aid institutions to 
raise increased sums for endowment of 
teachers’ salaries, the Board gave special 
consideration to the stage of develop- 
ment of the Negro colleges and appro- 


230 





priated substantial sums for endowment 
as well as sums for maintenance over a 
period of years. 

“Appropriations aggregating $5,375,- 
000 for endowment were made to the 
institutions listed below: 

Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee 

Hampton Institute, Virginia 

Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennes- 

see 


Lincoln University, Pennsylvania 
Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia 


Shaw University, Raleigh, North Car- 
olina 


Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia 
Talladega College, Talladega, Ala- 


bama 
Tuskegee Institute, Alabama 
Virginia Union University, Richmond, 
Virginia 
Wiley University, Marshall, Texas 
The Report notes the internal 
growth of self-assertion among Ne- 
groes which it previously for so long 
a time ignored and decried. It says: 


“The rapid growth of race conscious- 
ness of the Negro group was quickly re- 
flected in the Negro press, in books by 
Negro authors, and in social and busi- 
ness organizations. The white South 
became aware of these changes at first 
with much concern, and some reaction 
and a stiffening of racial barriers re- 
sulted; yet on the whole it has come to 
look on these developments as manifes- 
tations of a racial ferment of self-ex- 
pression which is world-wide in its im- 
plications, with the result that there is 
today a greater spirit of inquiry and 
tolerance, a desire to understand and 
accommodate, and an effort for social 
justice, totally different from the old 
kindly, feudal relationships of the earlier 
period.” 

The Report might have added, and 
different, too, from the old race rela- 
tions which showed itself in the lynch- 
ing of three thousand human beings 
since 1882! 

The Report notes the appropriations 
for public schools in the South: 

“Gratifying increases were made in 
salaries, school terms were lengthened, 
and the number of buildings increased. 
A comparison with the white schools, 


however, will make clear the relative 
backwardness of Negro schools :*

*The above figures show the average of the 
following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, 
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missis- 
sippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Texas. 


It seeks partly to excuse this enor. 
mous discrepancy by a belief that the 
gap between expenditure of white and 
colored schools “is growing. steadily 
less.” It asserts that the median ¢. 
penditures per pupil in white and Ne. 
gro schools were: 


oe NE $10.04 $2.69 
Se 30.11 9.44 
SRMONEE rior n ent c:a'e aux 200% 250%, 


The General Education Board and 
the American people are welcome to 
all the encouragement which these 
figures supply. 

Finally, beginning with 1927, the 
Board began a new program: 

“In the college field the Board dis- 
continued making annual grants. The 
main efforts were then focused upon 
strengthening university centers, such as 
Howard, Fisk and Atlanta, and upon 
strengthening a small number of strat. 
egically located colleges which had pros. 
pect of obtaining adequate support and 
were disposed to do work of high qual- 
ity.” 

Notwithstanding all of its past mis 
takes in attitude and personnel, there 
can be no doubt but what, in the 
lamentable failure of democracy in the 
South and the persistent enmity of the 
white worker, the General Education 
Board in later years has been the sal- 
vation of education among Negroes, 
This is shown by the total of its ap- 
propriations for Negro _ institutions

By 


6s HAT does color-blind mean, 

Father?” asked Anne Hedge 
one evening as the family sat before 
the open fire. 

“Some people, my dear, see colors 
in a peculiar way. For instance, I am 
told that Whittier always believed his 
green stair-carpet to be a cheerful 
> was the day after this that Miss 
Dale, the district-school _ teacher, 
brought a visitor to the morning ses- 
sesion. ‘This visitor, a close friend of 
hers, was also a teacher of young chil- 
dren. She had never visited her 
friend’s school before, and it was evi- 
dent to even the youngest boy and 
girl there that she took the deepest 
interest in all that went on. There 
was one child who outstripped the 
others in the thorough way in which 
she studied the lessons, and in her 
bright response during recitations. 
This little girl was black and named 
Melissa Drury. She was really charm- 
ing, thought Miss Hathaway, her hair 
falling in black curls to her shoulders, 
her eyes soft black, and her skin al- 
most as dark. While, in the history 
class, Miss Hathaway told a story, it 
was Melissa’s face that was all alight 
with interest. 

Why was it that when lessons were 
over and the children filed out for 
their noon hour, that light left Me- 
lissa’s face and she went to stand alone 
and droopingly ? 

“Don’t the others play with her?” 
asked Miss Hathaway. 

“It’s a shame!” answered her 
friend, “but I can’t help it. I am met 
always with ‘Mother doesn’t want me 
to’.” 

“Mother!” returned her friend im- 
patiently, “Mothers make children 
sometimes into a pack of little wolves.” 

“But she is so attractive! She 
speaks like a little lady.” 

“She is all that. She has been 
teared by a lady who makes a sort of 
pet of her and teaches her nice ways.” 

“Oh, shameful!” said Miss Hatha- 
way; and she strolled over to where 
Melissa stood and said, “May I eat 
my Junch with you under this tree? 
We'll share and share alike. You 
shall have half of mine and perhaps 
you will give me some of yours in re- 
turn,” a 

Presently Anne joined them with 
her own lunch basket. It was cov- 
ered thickly with early strawberries,

Color-Blind 


A Story 


I do not know whether you ever 
accept any fiction for THE CRISIS, 
unless written by your own people, 
but in case you ever do, I am 
sending you a little story written 
by a young friend of mine which 
I thought might please’ you, 


whether or not you could make 
use of it. It turns on the idea that 
children left to themselves have no 


race prejudice. It is the fault of 
the older people when it crops out 
in children. 

This story is essentially fact, and 
is all written from personal fam- 
ily experience. 

Mariana L. Storey, 
(Sister of the late 
Moorfield Storey) 





and she picked three large leaves from 
the lowest bough of the maple tree and 
heaped the berries upon the leaves for 
their dessert. 

“How pretty they are against the 
green,” said Miss Hathaway. “I 
haven’t eaten any wild strawberries 
for years.” 

It was a pleasant time. Melissa 
forgot her loneliness and brightened 
and smiled and talked—and Anne for- 
got her shyness and talked too—and 
Miss Hathaway put in a word now 
and then to keep the ball rolling and 
all three of them were happy. 

On the seventeenth of June, Mr. 
Hedge and Daniel always hung out the 
big American flag kept by the family 
for such holidays, and there was every 
year a little party for the children, 
each child being allowed to invite one 
guest. Supper was out-of-doors, with 
sweet joy of ice-cream, usually made 
of fresh strawberries from their own 
garden. 

This Hedge party had become a 
yearly event, eagerly looked forward 
to, and when June came there was al- 
ways a good deal of expectant talk 
among the school children, and guesses 
as to whom of their number would be 
invited. 

Anne was this year quite decided in 
her mind as to whom she meant to 
invite. Shyness prevented her easily 
forming new friendships, and she felt 
slightly in awe of dusky Melissa, be- 
cause in all their classes the colored 
child shone as a bright planet among 
dimmer stars. She seldom spoke to 
Melissa, and when she did it was awk-

wardly and briefly, but the attraction 
was not to be withstood. 

The Hedge place was, by all the 
village children, a much-desired play- 
ground, where at parties they were 
allowed a wider liberty than in most 
homes. As the middle of June ap- 
proached Susan and Anne Hedge were 
beset with small attentions from their 
school-mates. Melissa alone brought 
no offerings, no fragrant dewy rose or 
tempting early fruit. She watched the 
other little girls somewhat wistfully, 
but it never once entered her head that 
she might be Annie’s choice. Susan 
was pretty sure to ask Leslie Duncan, 
a pale rather silent girl, so entirely un- 
like Susan that everyone was puzzled 
at their being so intimate. 

“Tl had half a mind to give these 
elderberry blossoms to Susan,” said 
one of them one day when the noon 
hour was nearly over, “but what’s the 
use? She wouldn’t even see them she’s 
so taken up with Leslie. There they 
go, over to the big pine. They'll be 
late to school, but I don’t care.” 

‘““Where’s Melissa? Does anyone 
know?” asked Anne. 

“There she is, over by the wall,” 
said Mollie Wood, rather wondering 
that Anne should be interested in Me- 
lissa’s whereabouts. 

Anne went slowly across to the 
stone wall. A fiit of shyness came 
over her. Would this brilliant scholar 
care to come to the party? It was cer- 
tainly a piece of boldness asking her. 
Still, she did so want Melissa to be 
her guest! 

The little colored girl was watch- 
ing Anne’s slow approach, and when 
Anne reached her side stood silent, 
looking at her sombrely. 

“Hullo!” said Anne softly. 

“Hullo,” said Melissa. 

“Melissa” said Anne falteringly, “do 
you think—Melissa, I’m going to 
have,—I mean we’re going to have a 
party. It’s to be June 17th, and 
Mother said I might ask somebody. I 
wish—Melissa, would you come?” 

Was this the same Melissa? She 
was smiling. Her face shone. She 
stood suddenly more erect, a small 
image of Gladness. But she didn’t 
seem able to speak. And then tears 
came to her eyes, and rolled down 
her cheeks. 

“Are you sure you want me?” said 
she. 

“Want you!” cried Anne. “Of 


231 





























































































































































































































































































































































































































course I do. I want you so much 
kept being afraid you'd say no.” Now 
her embarrassment fled. She began to 
jump up and down. “Oh, Melissa, 
we'll have such fun!” she cried. 

Melissa’s radiance held all the after- 
noon. Miss Dale wondered, not at 
her ready answers but at the ncw hap- 
piness in her voice. The child's heart 
was singing over and over, “I’m the 
one Anne wanted. I’m going te the 
party!” 

The other children were amazed 
when they heard of the invitation. 
They came to Susan. “Does your sis- 
ter Anne like black children?” they 
asked. 

“Why not?” replied Susan. “If you 
mean Melissa, she’s brighter than any 
of us; and she’s good and” she added 
defiantly “she’s very pretty!” 

Melissa coming up just then, the 
group of little girls looked at her with 
awakened interest. Marjorie Snow 
offered to push her in the swing. 

Thus a turning-point was made, and 
Miss Dale looked on from day to day 
and was pleased, and wrote a letter all 
about Melissa to Miss Hathaway. 
And Miss Hathaway wrote back that 
she wished every letter she got might 
bring her as good tidings. 

The Hedge party was a great suc- 
cess. In the first place, never had 
there been, so Anne thought, such ; 
seventeenth of June. The blue sky 
held little scurrying white clouds like 
flying banners. The sun _ shone 
brightly, from the moment its beaming 
face appeared above Mt. Tiptoe. A 
breeze flung the big flag in front of the 
house into graceful folds. Robins and 
bobolinks and golden orioles were 
singing. And the children were every- 
where, getting ready for the party. 

The long work-bench must be 
brought out by the boys into the or- 
chard and covered with a fresh white 
tablecloth. Chicken sandwiches and 


lamb sandwiches and others of cottage 
cheese must be made,—Susan and 
Anne did that—, and Jimmy squeezed 
lemons for the lemonade, while their 
Daniel, 


older brother, hulled moun- 


tains of strawberries brought by Mr. 
Hedge from the garden; and Mrs. 
Hedge made ice-cream. The cake, 
some sponge and some chocolate 
frosted, had been baked the day before, 
and stood in state on the pantry shelf, 
which little Geoffrey on tiptoe tried 
repeatedly and in vain to reach. 

The guests came promptly at four 
o’clock,—Ben Stevens, Leslie Duncan, 
Ted Lawrence, Melissa Drury and 
Bobby Hill. They filed through the 
front gate, smiling broadly and dressed, 
not quite in their best, for their moth- 
ers knew that the Hedge children were 
inclined to romp, but in fresh linen 
suits or gingham dresses. 

First they all went and shook hands 
with Mrs. Hedge, who said how glad 
she was that they could come, and 
that she was especially glad to see Me- 
lissa, who had never been to one of the 
seventeenth of June parties. And 
wouldn’t they all like to go into the 
hay-field and have a ride upon the hay- 
wagon? They would. ‘They had an 
uproarous time in the hay-field. And 
then they played hide-and-go-seek ; and 
this was such a favorite game, and they 
found so many perfectly fascinating 
places to hide in, that there wasn’t 
time to do anything else before supper. 

One of the ladies looking on at the 
party said to Anne, “Is that little col- 
ored girl your friend?” 

Anne hesitated and looked a little 
blank and replied, “Melissa is my 
triend,—that pretty one.” 

Her father heard her and smiled 
quietly to himself, and turning to the 
lady said, “Anne doesn’t seem to recog- 
nize her friend from your description. 
I think I may say that Anne, thank 
Heaven for it, is color-blind.” 

The lady laughed and then sighed. 
“IT wish we all were,” she said. 

As they sat around the supper table 
in the orchard, Daniel at one end and 
Susan at the other, with four boys and 
girls on each side, the children were 
as jolly and as hungry as one could 
wish. 

Mr. and Mrs. Hedge came out now 
and then to see how things were go- 








ing. The food certainly was going at 
a great rate. And perhaps the hap. 
piest child there was little dusky Me 
lissa, seated between Daniel and Anne. 

After supper Mr. Hedge brought 
out his flute and played “All the blye 
bonnets are over the border” and 
Scotch reels to which the children 
danced on the grass till out of breath, 
How little Melissa flew down the line 
in Virginia Reel! Next they played 
the adjective game. Melissa sat next 
tc Daniel, because he said he never 
could play well unless he was beside 
someone with curls. The curls, he 
said, had a curious and helpful effect 
on his brain. But Melissa wrote bet. 
ter adjectives than he did, so that he 
pretended to cry, and this made her 
laugh. 

“I’m not color-blind about Melissa,” 
said Anne a few days late to her father. 
“Of course she’s black and I’m white 
—but we are just the same inside—It 
doesn’t make any difference except 
that Melissa is so much brighter than 
I am.” 

Through the open window she could 
hear her Aunt Julia talking with her 
mother on the piazza. ‘Black and 
white are all the style this summer,” 
Aunt Julia was saying, “Somehow 
neither color looks so well by itself. 
It’s the combination that’s so effec- 
tive.” 

After the Hedge children’s party 
Melissa had no more sad and lonely 
days, for Susan and Anne Hedge were 
very popular girls, and Susan and par- 
ticularly Anne had “taken up” Me- 
lissa. 

Just before the party ended at eight 
o'clock everyone sang. At first Me- 
lissa just listened, but when they closed 
with America she sang too. And at 
the last verse everyone stopped sing- 
ing,—Mr. and Mrs. Hedge and all the 
children; for Melissa’s voice was like 
some rare and wonderful bird’s. It 
rose sweet and clear and high. Anne 
looked proudly toward her father and 
mother. 

“You must come and sing to us, 
sometime, my dear,” said Mrs. Hedge 
as she bade Melissa good-night.

CRISIS 





I differ with you and enclose you here- 
with copy of an analysis of some of the 
laws of Michigan, also decisions re- 
lating to our group. I sometime ago, 
delivered an address covering discrim- 
ination laws in Michigan and have an 
extra copy of the various statutes and 
decisions I looked up, which I am en- 
closing, as it might be handy tor your 

al department of the N. A. A. C. P. 
legal department o 
at some future time. 

You will notice the Civil Rights law 
which is found in Act 375, Public Acts 
1919, of Michigan, on page 65/. Sec- 
tion two covers the point raised by 
vour article and expressly prohibits the 
display of any sign suggesting that any 
race, creed or color is not desired in 
the place. You will notice the penal- 
ties under the act and the restaurant in 
Detroit comes within the provisions 
of the act. I call your attention to the 
fact that the original act which be- 
came effective Sept. 19, 1885 did not 
contain the provisions of section two 
which now covers such acts of dis- 
crimination as set forth in your article; 
the law was amended by the legisla- 
ture of 1919 and the National Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People through its Lansing 
branch, together with aid of other 
branches in Michigan, was instru- 
mental in having the law made 
stronger. 

You will notice that it is a mis- 
demeanor under the law and it seems 
to me that if the prosecuting attorney 
of Wayne County, would send an 
oficer down to this restaurant and the 
sign was there, that the proprietor 
could be arrested, as it would be com- 
mitting a misdemeanor in the presence 
of the oficer. A man from Indiana 
came to Bay City a couple of years ago, 
opened a cafe and put up the very 
same sort of a sign. I at once took 
the matter up with the chief of police, 
who sent an officer down to the cafe, 
with a copy of the act as prepared by 
me, showed it to the proprietor and 
gave him his choice of taking it down 
or coming to the station, and the sign 
was taken down forthwith. Your 
local branch in Detroit could hardle 
this matter and our group has an assis- 
tant prosecuting attorney of Wayne 
County, in the person of Mr. Lloyd 
Loomis, who I know would gladly 
take this matter up, if referred to him 
properly. 

I hope your National office, will 
call the attention of this discrimination 
to the Detroit branch and have them 
see to it, that the plain provision of 
the Civil Rights law of Michigan 
covering this sort of discrimination 
quoted in your article in the June 
Crisis is enforced.

July, 1930 


HE Crisis—the literary impres- 
sion it has made upon me, so far, 
atter reading about a dozen or so of 
its issues is that it’s like the white 
man’s “‘trade-paper”, i, e. strictly ab- 
sorbed in its own interests; in this case, 
exclusively, Negro-Racial. Its editor, 
Mr. Du Bois, seems to me is suffering 
from a chronic inferiority complex. 
He gloats, indiscriminately, over any 
and all minor or major Negro super’- 
orities that come to his notice, with 
such terms as, “These black men rule 
the white”, and similar taunting and 
disparaging remarks about the white 
man. Apparently, not realizing at all, 
that white men, too, are his readers, if 
not the greatest and most influential 
majority of his circulation. Why no: 
better then assume the truly aggres- 
sive yet humble and dignified attitude 
of the man of self-faith, who knows his 
own worth and cares not what others 
think? Why exaggerate your relative 
importance? Why teach your colored 
readers such repulsive manners! “See, 
vou, white trash, I, your ex-slave am 
your ruler now!” How terrible your 
innuendo sounds, nay, shrieks, almost 
out of everyone of your editorials. 
Nevertheless, for what you have 
accomplished in the Judge Parker case, 
you deserve lots of credit and I take 
my hat off for you. And what my 
white brethren did to your race and 
ours—Don’t forget that! At Sherman, 
Texas,—I bow—not only ashamed but 
horror stricken at our mutual catastro- 
phe. Won't you take this Five Dol- 
lars of me as a pledge to continue my 


membership in the N. A. A. C. P.? 
BARNETT JENY GOTLIEB 
New York. 


I will enclose a $1.50, one dollar 
and fifty cents, for another year. I 
have been trying to get some of my 
triends to take the good book but they 
will not. I am old and have the rheu- 
matism nearly all the time. I sure do 
love to read about my race coming to 
the front. I and my husband are old 
and we both cannot do very much. 


Mary A. GREEN, 
Kentucky. 


I enclose check for my subscription. 
I consider THE Crisis one of the most 
valuable of American publications, but 
I think it is a pity that when the Crow 
Flies, he never perceives anything of 
good accomplished by the white citi- 
zens of our country. He sees nothing 
but the weaknesses, foibles and evils. 

I think this continued attitude, 
while possibly a good thing for white 
folks to realize, that they may become 
aware of what the other side thinks, 
cannot but arouse a feeling of hate and 
bitterness among the other readers, 


which will not help solve the problem 
of race adjustment. It might be a 
good thing to occasionally publish 
some of the good things accomplished 
by the Government, in its struggle 
with the momentous questions it has 
to face. Perhaps we do not all live up 
to our privileges and our responsibili- 
ties, but is there any Government that 
is doing better? 

You are making a good and brave 
fight for justice. But hatred and 
irony will do more good if occasionally 
tempered by good-will and a sense of 
the difficulties faced by others. 

BERTHA JOHNSON, 
Brooklyn. 


N the March number of THE 

Crisis, I find a very readable and 
instructive paper on the subject, 
“Race Crossings in the United States,” 
by Caroline Bond Day. 

I am all the more interested in this 
scholarly paper, for the reason that, 
forty-eight years ago, before the Visi- 
ble Admixture Law, so called, of. 
Ohio, was repealed, which made it a 
felony for a person “of pure white 
blood” to intermarry with a person of 
“African descent,” I had the honor of 
defending a colored minister of the 
Gospel for marrying a couple, one of 
whom, the male, was a German of 
“pure white blood,” and the other, a 
woman, who apparently, had a “visi- 
ble admixture of African blood.” 

The minister who performed the 
marriage ceremony, was arrested and 
put on trial for a breach of the statute 
and your subscriber, who, in 1882, had 
been at the Bar for twelve years, was 
retained to defend him. 

My defense was predicated on the 
following five postulates: 

1. The natural law is superior to the 
civil law. 

2. Where there is a conflict between 
the natural law and the civil law, the 
civil law must quail before the natural 
law. 

3. According to the natural law, the 
human sexes must marry. 

4. And by the same token, a person 
must marry one of the opposite sex, 
between whom and himself there is 
love and affection. 

5. Any civil law which restrains or 
prohibits such a marriage, must quail 
before the natural law, and is null and 
void. 

My opponent in the trial of this 
case, which lasted several days, before 
the sainted Daniel H. Tilden, of Cleve- 
land, Ohio, was ex-judge Peter F 
Young (long since deceased) who did 
his “possible,” as the French would say, 
for the State. The verdict was for 
the defendant, and your subscriber 
went out of court in ecstasies of de- 
light. 


233 














































































































































































































































































































































































































A majority of the members of our 
Cleveland Bar, who were then all 
white men except this writer, laughed 
at Judge Tilden’s decision; but, within 
a month thereafter, when this writer 
was a delegate to a State Convention, 
held at Cincinnati, of which the late 
Alphonso Taft (subsequently Attor- 
ney General of the United States, and 
father of ex-President, William How- 
ard Taft), was a member, he was 
congratulated by the eminent jurist 
and the decision of Judge Tilden was 
heartily endorsed, by him.

FEW days ago I perused the 

best part of “The New Negro”, 
(Is that correct title?) and read your 
contribution to it, containing a great 
deal of information as to colonial ad- 
venture. Somewhere among my 
papers I have a friendly letter from 
your pen of several years’ date. 





Raised in England and France, I 
had an aunt who was lady’s maid to a 
wealthy Negress upon whose features 
we looked with curiosity and awe. 

I have a brother-in-law who is a 
virulent Frenchman, and a German- 
hating jingoist. One of his ancestors 
(an American) was sawn between two 
boards by his own Negroes in Haiti. 
His French born widow returned to 
France. 

As a nation we owe a great deal to 
the West India Negroes who foiled 
Napoleon’s designs upon Louisiana, as 
well as to the black shock troops who 
fought in the late war. 

I was in France during the war and 
found the feeling for the black man 
rather perplexing, and saw that many 
cross-currents exist. Some of the 
friendliness is clearly due to newspaper 
propaganda. While delving in the ar- 
chives of the Norfolk (Va.) Library, 
1 saw that the Deputy who announced 
the fall of Richmond in the French 


Chamber was hooted, and compelled to 
sit down. Sympathy was evidently é 
the side of the Southern planters before 
Germany became so threatening. 

In one American outpost (Hono. 
lulu), I found the mos: perfect melt- 
ing pot existing under the Stars and 
Strips—which symbol stands for 4 
democracy within itself but a plutoc- 
racy among the sisterhood of nations 
and races. There are thirty-two racial 
mixtures there and the Hawaiian js 
the medium between white, brown, 
and yellow races. 

I saw a Negro strike down a drunk. 
en white sailor who had applied an 
opprobious epithet to him, and sent. 
ment was in the Negro’s favor. In 
the territory of Hawaii there exists 
a deliberate propaganda for racial 
friendship, entertainmen:: 
in character, etc.

THE BROWSING READER 








ROM November, 1929 through 
April, 1930 the five best sellers 

in THe Crisis Book Shop have been: 

R. R. Moton: “What the Negro 
Thinks”’. 

William Pickens: “Bursting Bonds”. 

Countée Cullen: “The Black 
Christ”. 

Leslie P. Hill: Toussaint L’Ouver- 
ture. 

Benjamin Brawley: “The Negro in 
Literature and Art”. 


We have on our desk some readable 
books which we are glad to recom- 
mend to our friends: 

“The Story of Haiti”, written by 
Harriett Gibbs Marshall, is clear, con- 
cise and unbiased and makes a good 
short résumé for those who would 
know more of our sister island. It has 
an appendix with much information 
about Haitian music, literature and 
art, and other matters which will help 
the student. It sells for $2. 

Sidney De La Rue, who for a num- 
ber of years was Financial Adviser 
sent from the United States to the 
Government of Liberia, is now Finan- 
cial Advisor to the Republic of Haiti. 
As a result of his stay in Liberia, he 
has published, through Putnams, “The 
Land of the Pepper Bird—Liberia”. 
It is an interesting book, attractively 
written, and, on the whole, after many 
years of close acquaintance with the 
country, its people and its problems, 


234 


Mr. De La Rue believes in Liberia. 
He says: 

“Liberia’s future is not that of a 
nation of dominant and dependent 
races. It is a future of equality of 
economic opportunity and justice—a 
land where a Negro nation shall 
demonstrate to other nations the capac- 
ity for self-government, liberty and 
meritorious action. ... 

“The future of Liberia as a nation 
can be visioned only from its past ef- 
forts. ‘Judge us by the road we have 
come rather than by the way we ought 
to go’, one of their officials has said. 
Not more than ten years ago there 
were no roads. Today, there are more 
than two hundred miles of reasonably 
good gravel road. Automobiles will 
transport to the coast the products of 
the interior, and the human porters 
will be released from their toil, to more 
lucrative employment. Short-wave 
wireless stations have brought into im- 
mediate communication towns that 
were formerly weeks apart. Employ- 
ment has been found at home for more 
of those who sat idle, or else sought 
their work in foreign lands, not many 
years ago. Perhaps the most impor- 
tant accomplishment has been the un- 
official assembly, called by the Presi- 
dent, of the chiefs of the tribes. These 
men have met with the President on 
but two occasions and this year have 
been called again. From these in- 
formal beginnings, it is to be hoped a 





permanent native assemd|y may be ac- 
complished.” 

George S. Schuyler has been writing 
in the American Mercury, ‘A Negro 
Looks Ahead”. He concludes that 
the Negro will remain in this coun- 
try; that bi-racialism is not feasable, 
and that breaches in the color line are 
such that “by 2000 A. D., a full 
blooded American Negro may be rare 
enough to get a job in a museum; 
and a century from now our Ameri- 
can social leaders may De as tanned 
naturally as they are now striving to 
become artifically.” 

Other articles which our readers 
should notice are two interpretations 
by foreigners, Count Herman Keyser- 
ling, in the Atlantic Monthly for 
October and November, 1929; and 
Carl Jung on “Your Negroid and In- 
dian Behavior” in the April Forum. 
The American Mercury has articles 
on “Southern Credo” by Sara Haardt 
and “The American Negro in Europe” 
by J. A. Rogers. The former says: 

If any fact relating to the Civil War 
was obvious, even to a mind of thirteen, 
it was the fact that the South took up 
the conflict over the issue of slavery. 
Every Southerner knows it instinctively, 
but with his peculiar talent for escaping 
the unpleasant realities, he denies it @ 
passionately. That denial, with him, 
not a matter of principle but of etiquette 
and like all matters of etiquette, a de 
fense mechanism, pure and simple.

I Hear a Brown Girl Singing 
By HELEN LENART YOKE 
ROWN girl, 
With your slender throat 
That sings to me 
Of all the sorrows of your race, 
Hear my song. 
I have seen your sorrow, 
I have known your heartache, 
I have felt your desolation, 
I, too, have been an alien 
In my native land. 


And I say to you: 

Sing! 

Even as your song touched me 

And made me kindred to you, 

So shall it touch mankind 

And fear, and hate, and prejudice, 
Shall vanish with your song. 
Brown girl, 

With your slender throat, 

Sing on, and on, and on.

Sweeter than river lyric or the gold 
Of bells at sunset . . . requiem of bird, 
Or lilt of branches wrestling with old

Awaits a distant April tenderly, 
Certain of the high utmost life can bring: 
Your step come home... the turning 
of your key.

What matter then if nations war 

On nearby land or distant shore. 

What matter if I live a day 

Or have my choice to live for aye. 

I would not care if stars should 
fall— 

I would not care if hell should 
brawl. 

My lonely heart would cease its pin- 
ing, 

And then the sun could cease its 
shining , 

Just love me. 


Troubadour 
By VIRGINIA V. HOUSTON 


DO not like you. 

You strut about your ghetto streets 
Revering noone, despising yourself; 
Your yellow skin, and reddened eyes 
Are dull within your yellow face, 
And your body is soft. 


An unremembered, sorrowful man, 

Scarred body and black face 

Yearning toward a starry sky, 

Sat before a cabin door 

And gave his soul to make the songs 

You distort to a silly dancing rhythm. 

You deny your heritage, put him to 
shame, 

With your narrow chest and pimpled 
skin. 


You are mongrel, 

Like your songs and your uke. 
There is nothing of beauty in you, 
And I do not like you. 


Poems 
By CYNTHIA MARKS 


Where Are You? 


ID you see a large oak tree as you 
passed this way? 

Surely you remember you passed here 
yesterday! 

A day is gone and passed away 

But what of the tree that bowed and 
swayed? 

Loaded down in richest green, 

Not a trace of that tree is seen. 

Maybe I passed another tree in another 
yesterday 

Yet I can’t forget that large green oak 

And I think I passed this way. 


New Day 


ABISING new there stands another 

day. 

How will I wear thy countenance away? 

(So golden-featured, quick of limb and 
mind) 

Your heart an organ tuned to rushing 
time 

Beats out the hours of my day. 

I am to work with thee, and then away 

Where your gay face is never seen, 

Where dark is day and time an endless 
beam. 


If I Must Know 
By MAE V. COWDERY 


F I must know sorrow 
To live 
Then burden my soul 
With the frustrated dreams 
Of good women! 


If I must know torture 
To live 

Then bind me with vows 
To complacency! 


If I must love 

To live 

Then be quick . . .! 

Give me back this elusive thing 


The Gods call love . . .!

@ Nr. George Foster Peabody origi- 
nated the idea of taking the Hampton 
Choir abroad. It has been making a 
remarkable record in Great Britain, 
Austria, France and Germany. 
@ At the opening of Paul Robeson’s 
interpretation of Othello in London, 
Mr. Robeson received twenty curtain 
calls, which is perhaps a record num- 
ber. Miss Peggy Ashcroft, a white 
Englishwoman of great beauty was 
Desdemona; an American, Miss Ellen 
Volkenburg was the producer. The 
setting was by James Pryde. Iago was 
played by Maurice Browne. 
@ Miss K. H. Jones, Principal of 
Portway College, Reading, England, 
had many West African girls in he 
institution and always treated them 
without discrimination and with great 
personal care. They were sent to her 
by well-to-do parents from the West 
Coast and she kept charge of them 
during vacations and often, when they 
left as brides, helped to purchase their 
outfits for them. She has recently 
died. 
@ According to the Milan, Italy 
Corriere: 

“Lillian Evanti appeared in concert 
at the Conservatory before a packed 
house, among whom were many dis- 
tinguished persons of the art world. 
This young singer gave proof of her 
accomplishment and charm in a most 
interesting program of quality and va- 
riety, singing in five languages. She 
gives to art an aristocratic voice, which 
is distinguished by a rare culture. 
Evanti, is already noted for her suc- 
cesses in Opera at Milano, Turin.

“As many splendid white women and

races in these Negro appointments that 
is most objectionable and will tend to 
create friction.”

Zenobia Miller Bundy 


She taught with unusual success in the 
Garnett-Patterson Junior High School 
until her death in April. 


[ Miss Ellen F. Mason of Newport, 
Rhode Island left in her will $50,000 
for the colored Calhoun School of 
Lownes County, Ala., $25,000 for 
Tuskegee Institute, and $15,000 tor 
the Episcopal Church Institute of Ne- 


gro schools. 


@ The Right Reverend John Hurst, 
Bishop of the A. M. E. Church, was 
born in 1863 in Haiti; educated there 
and at Wilberforce, and joined the 
A. M. E. Church in 1893. He served 
as Financial Secretary and was finally 
elected to the Bishopric in 1912. He 
was a Trustee of Howard University 
and a member of the Board of Direc- 
tors of the N. A. A. C. P. He died 
May 6th at Baltimore. He leaves a 
widow and a son, who is a practicing 
physician in Washington. 


@ Stansbury Boyce of Washington, 
D. C. a retired business man, died 
April 13th. Mr. Boyce, when an in- 
fant, was taken by his parents to 
Trinidad, British West Indies, where 
he grew up. In his early manhood he 
went to Caracas, Venezuela, where he 
spent considerable time with his father 
in the gold mining industry. He re- 
turned to Baltimore and entered the 
teaching profession shortly after the 
Civil war. 

In 1891 he established and con- 
ducted a most successful department 
store in Jacksonville, Florida where his 
reputation for strictly business meth- 
ods, his fine sense of fairness and hon- 
esty won for him the respect of the en- 
tire community. 

He continued in business in one lo- 
cation for seventeen years when over- 
taken by ill health, he retired and 
made two successive trips to Europe. 
In 1909 he established a residence in 
Vashington where his business activi- 
tes were limited to investment in real

estate. He is survived by his widow, 
Mrs. Frances Boyce. 


@ The Second National Negro Mu- 
sical Festival has been held in Phila- 
delphia with striking success. Two 
concerts were given in the afternoon 
and evening of May 17. The most 
pleasing artists were Marion Ander- 
son, the well-known contralto singer 
Louia Vaughn Jones, the violinist, and 
R. August Lawson, the pianist. The 
Trouvere Trio played well, and Miss 
Marinda Dunnigan’s voice was sweet 
and well used. Marie Amelie Young, 
daughter of the late Colonel Charles 
Young and graduate of the Paris Con- 
servatory was the gifted accompanist

ers sang well but were not up to the 
usual tradition of Fisk, while the 
Howard singers gave a very poor per-

@ In Shippensburg, Pa., Negroes have 
always been segregated in the graded 
schools. For years they have occupied 
an old, ramshackle building and the 
teachers have been white store-keepers 
or other fossils who have served the 
politicians and have been placed on the 
school pay-roll without any regard for 
their ability to teach. Last year the 
colored people induced the State De- 
partment of Education to make the 
School Board repair the building 
which they did to the amount of 
$3,000. They then asked for a com- 
petent colored teacher, but this request 
has been disregarded. The present 
teacher is a white man who has been

employed for forty years and was a 
former store-keeper. Colored girls 
from the State Teachers’ College are 
not allowed to practice teaching in this 


school. The boys and girls leave the 
school and enter the Junior High 
School unprepared for their work. 


Shippenburg has a population of 6,000 
of whom perhaps a hundred are col- 
ored. 

@ Thomas J. Calloway, a lawyer, 
teacher and dealer in real estate is 
dead in Washington. He was born 
in Tennessee in 1866, and educated at 
Fisk and the Howard University Law 
School. He served as clerk in the War 
department, president of Alcorn Uni- 
versity, Mississippi, and Assistant. Prin- 
cipal of Tuskegee. He was placed in 
charge of the Negro Exhibit in Paris 
in 1900. In 1906 he had charge of 
the Negro Department of the James- 
town Exposition and since 1907 has 
been engaged in real estate. In 1930 
he assumed charge of the business de-' 
partment of THE Crisis but was com- 
pelled to relinquish this work because 
of ill health. He leaves a widow and 
two daughters. 

@ Charles S. Gilpin is dead. He was 
born in Virginia in 1873 and learned 
the printer’s trade. In 1892 he began 
acting and traveling in shows, being a 
member of the Williams and Walker 
Company, the Southern Minstrels and 
the Canadian Jubilee Singers. In 1916 
he organized the Lafayette Players in 
New York. He got his first part on 
Broadway in Drinkwater’s “Lincoln” 
and finally appeared in ‘Emperor 
Jones”. The Drama League nom- 
inated him one of the ten persons 
who contributed the most to the stage 
during that season and in 1906 he re- 
ceived the Spingarn medal. He leaves 
a widow and son.

@ John E. Nail, Jr. of New York 
City has been made a member of the

has much to do with the development 
of the city. 

@ The Harlem Experimental The- 
atre, begun and formerly directed by 
Miss Dorothy Peterson, now of “The 
Green Pastures” cast, presented on 
May 24, at the New York Public Li- 
brary, 135th Street Branch, “The 
Duchess Says Her Prayers”, by Mary 
Cass Canfield, and “The No ’Count 
Boy”, by Paul Green. The plays 
were given under the direction of Miss 
Helen Brooks, at one time teacher of 
Dramatics at Hampton Institute, as- 
sisted by Mrs. Regina Andrews. This 
presentation marked the third public 
appearance of the players. The or- 
ganization came into existence two 
years ago in order to provide a meet- 
ing place for the young Negro actor, 
artist and playwright in the creation 
of an art truly representative of the 
race. 

“The Duchess Says Her Prayers”, a 
deli¢ate and subtle play of Milanese 
life in the 15th Century, was superbly 
acted by Edna Lewis Thomas, of the 
London “Porgy” cast, Ira De A. Reid, 
of the Urban League, and Regina An- 
derson Andrews of the New York 


Public Library Staff. The whole was 
a beautiful, finished production. 


The portrayal of the character, 
“The No-’Count Boy”, by James 
Thibodeaux, who played the part with 
the Dallas, Texas, group, added to the 
decidedly professional air which char- 
acterized the presentation. Equal 
honor was deserved by the supporting 
actors, Leona Wright, Cecile Scott 
and Robert Dorsey, who not only de- 
signed and arranged the stage settings, 
but who, with Miss Brooks and Mrs. 


Andrews, deserves much of the credit

sented Dessalines, Black Emperor of 
Haiti, before a large and distinguished 
audience which included Mr. W. Cam-

Clarke, Haitian Consul. The historic 
drama was produced at the Fine Arts 
Theatre under the general direction of 
Mrs. Maud Cuney-Hare, with Miss 
Catharine Huntington as dramatic 
coach. 

The crowd grouping and the general 
degree of excellence of the whole cast 
were commented upon by professors 
of the drama who were present, includ- 
ing Clayton D. Gilbert, head of the 
dramatic department of the New Eng- 
land Conservatory of Music who de- 
scribed the acting of Granville Stewart 
in the role of Dessalines as the equal 
of a professional. 

The cast was a long one and in- 
cluded pupils of the Allied Arts Cen- 
tre Ballet class, who performed the 
Voodoo and the Haitian Meringue to 
typical music written by Clarence 
Cameron White. Incidental music 
was drawn from compositions on na- 
tive themes by the Haitian composer 
Justin Elie, and African music com- 
posed by Montague Ring (Miss Ira 
Aldridge) with Creole-Haitian folk

Ordinance of Richmond, Va., uncon- 
stitutional. This follows its decision 
in the St. Louis and New Orleans 
cases. The leading Richmond paper 
says editorially: 

When WwW hite voters who were ag- 
grieved (and properly aggrieved) at the 
incursions of Negroes into their neigh- 
borhoods came to Council and demanded 
a remedy our Councilmen passed a segre- 
gation ordinance, knowing, if they are 
capable of knowing anything, that it 
would be declared null and void by the 
Federal courts. 

This inexcusably stupid action of 

Council could be dismissed without com- 
ment were it not for the fact that it has 
served to delay the solution of a problem 
which must be solved if the pleasant re- 
lations which exist between the races in 
Richmond are to be preserved. 
@ At Paine College, Augusta, Geor- 
gia, there has been a strike of the col- 
ored students against the white Presi- 
dent and teachers. It arose because of 
the suspension of five men. When they 
were refused reinstatement, the whole 
school went on strike and the police 
were notified. ‘The strike lasted for 
three days and was finally broken 
up by shutting down of the board- 
ing department. The school is con- 
ducted jointly by the white Methodist 
Church South and the Colored M. E. 
Church. Among the leaders of. the 
strike was Walter E. Holsey, grand- 
son of Bishop Holsey, the founder of 
the College. Among many charges 
which the students make is the fol- 
lowing: 

“The chapel at Paine College is dis- 

figured by a stained glass window bear- 
ing this obnoxious legend: ‘In Memory 
of Aunt Eve, Black Mammy of Rev. 
David Morton, D.D.’” 
@ There has been a strike of the stu- 
dents at Greensboro A. and T. Col- 
lege, N. C., which began with a pro-

@ A notable victory has been won by 
the colored people of Cincinnati un- 
der the leadership of W. P. Dabney’s 
newspaper, The Union. In August, 
1929 a colored woman weighing. only 
110 pounds was brutally beaten by a 
policeman. Charges were brought 
against the policeman and he was fi- 
nally dismissed from the force. He 
applied for re-instatement, but his dis-

ages was then brought and a verdict 
of $1,000 was recently given.

in Racine 58 years and for a long time 
ran a well-known barber shop. After- 
ward he was employed in the Post Of- 
fice. He retired from active work six 
years ago. He left a widow, a son 
and three daughters. 

@ Ira L. Cooper came to St. Louis 
thirty-two years ago from a_ small 
town in Missouri. He joined the po- 
lice force 24 years ago. As a result 
of hard work the rank of Detective 
Sergeant was given him in February, 
1923. In 1924 Sergeant Cooper was 
conspicuous in the apprehension of rob- 
bers who took $17,000 worth of jew- 
elry from Mrs. W. A. Stickney. For 
this daring recovery, W. A. Stickney 
gave Sergeant Cooper a reward of 
$5,000, the largest individual reward 
ever given a detective of the St. Louis 
Police Department. 

During February, 1930, Detective 
Sergeant Cooper succeeded in locating 
and rescuing Jacob Hoffman, wealthy 
bookmaker, who had been kidnapped 
and held for $100,000 ransom by the 
notorious ‘““Gas House Gang”, a band 
of Syrian and Italian gangsters and 
gunmen who had engaged in a series 
of kidnappings which had netted the 
gang nearly one-half million dollars 
within the period of about three 
months. The gang was completely 
broken up and the leaders apprehended. 
This particular piece of daring and 
spectacular detective work resulted in 
Sergeant Cooper’s promotion to the 
rank of Lieutenant of Police on March 
17, 1930. As a reward for his rescue, 
Jacob Hoffman has offered Lieutenant 
and Mrs. Cooper a trip to Europe and 
return with all expenses. Lieutenant 
Cooper has recently been placed in 
command of the Negro Unit of the St. 
Louis Detective Bureau which unit is 
composed of twelve crack detectives 
all of whose rating for efficiency is 
above 90 per cent. 

The St. Louis Police Department 
has credited Lieutenant Cooper with 
having served prominently in the solu- 
tion of the $33,000 Mercantile Trust 
Company robbery, the Terminal Rail- 
road larceny involving $40,000 and 
resulting in the conviction of seven- 
teen persons, the Chesterfield, Missouri 
Bank robbery and the Home Laundry 
murder mystery all of which were 
crimes of the most baffling nature. 

Lucana and Chauncey, the two chil- 
dren of Lieutenant and Mrs. Cooper 
are both graduates of the Sumner High 
School, St. Louis. Chauncey, a grad- 
uate of the University of Minnesota,

@ The burning of the dead body of 
George Hughes at Sherman, Texas is 
thus described by the Associated Press: 

At midnight the body of the Negro 
who had been burned to death in the 
vault was thrown down a ladder while 
the mob howled and cheered. 

A parade was formed at once, with 
the body of Hughes on an automobile 
truck. Behind it marched several thou- 
sand hooting, yelling and jeering men and 
boys. Women were among them and 
women with babes in their arms had 
been in the mob. 








As the parade started some one yelled 
“Take him home,” and the line swung 
toward the Negro section of the city 
about seven or eight blocks distant, The 
body of Hughes was strung up to a tree 
in front of a two-story brick building 
containing a Negro drug store and room. 
ing house. The drug store was broken 
into and boxes, counters and other jn- 
flammable material brought out and 
piled under the hanging body. A torch 
was then applied. 

After burning the body the mob set 
fire to the drug store and to a number 
of other Negro homes and stores in a 
radius of three blocks, all being de- 
stroyed. Among these was the only Ne- 
gro undertaking establishment in the 
city. A white undertaking firm had to 
be called to take charge of Hughes's 
body after it had been cut down by the 
militiamen. Officers have learned 
that large quantities of liquor were 
brought into the city prior to the rioting, 
and it is believed that considerable of it 
remains. 

The Arizona Republican says: 

Sherman, Texas, though not one of 
the large cities of the state, is an im- 
portant small city of perhaps 20,000. It 
is situated in the heart of the famous 
Red River country, and is the seat of 
the largest free fair in America. It js 
also the seat of several educational and 
cultural institutions, five colleges, an 
academy, a conservatory of music, an 
excellent public school system. It is one 
of the most accessible points in north 
Texas, served by more than 100 railroad 
trains daily over seven lines, besides mo- 
tor car systems. It is one of the leading 
manufacturing towns in Texas, with an 
annual output of at least $25,000,000 
worth of products of widely diversified 
industries. It is the center of one of the 
great good roads systems of the state. 
It abounds in churches. 

@ Bishop W. Sampson Brooks of the 
A. M. E. Church recently married 
Miss Elizabeth Carter of New Bed- 
ford, Mass., noted as a leader in move- 
ments among colored women. Bishop 
Brooks was formerly stationed in Li- 
beria, and now presides over the 10th 
Episcopal District of Texas. 

@ Recently a girls’ dormitory has 
been erected on Prairie View State 
College, Prairie View, Texas. It isa 
four-story building with 70 bedrooms, 
parlors and modern conveniences. The 
cost of the building was $105,000, and 
the furnishing $15,000. Of this 
amount, $50,000 was contributed by 
the state of Texas, and $70,000 by 
the General Education Board. 

@ Lucius M. Tobin and Mabel J. 
Lucas both .of the Prairie View Col 
lege faculty have been awarded Gen- 
eral Education Board Fellowships ot 
$1,000.00 each to pursue graduate 
studies at The University of Chicago 
for the academic year 1930-31. Mr. 
Tobin holds the A.B. degree from Vir 
ginia Union and the M.A. degree from 
The University of Michigan and will 
specialize in Social Science. Miss Lucas

YOUTHPORT 


For Juniors of the N. A. A. C. P. 














Youthport is not living up to 
our expectations. In other words, 
it is not receiving from young folk 
of high school age the contribu- 
tions which it should. It is pos- 
sible that some of them assume 
that the whole section is to be 
written by the Editors. That, of 
course, is untrue. The Editors 
ought to have the chance to pass 
upon a multitude of contributions. 
But we have received few. Sup- 
pose our high school readers wake 
up and send us some of the mas- 
terpieces that they have already 
achieved and some of which they 
have in mind. Youthport is in a 
receptive mood. 





THE MOON 

ene and Knox dragged slowly 

up the walk, Knox, walking 
slightly ahead, clasping Jeanne’s hand 
in his grubby one, and with the other 
continually brushing the curly hair 
from his forehead. On reaching the 
steps of the house, Jeanne, disengag- 
ing her hand, sat down with a little 
sigh. 

“I’m so tired,” she murmured. 

Knox flopped down beside her and, 
picking up a withered flower from the 
walk, tore the dead leaves from it, one 
by one. Night had come and the shad- 
ows of the trees swayed and quivered 
on the side of the house. 

Finally Knox, dropping the shorn 
stem from his hands, laid one on 
Jeanne’s knee, and turning to her, said, 
“Will you come home with me when 
I leave Grandma’s house ?”’ 

“Uh Huh,” whispered Jeanne, not 
looking at him, but curling his fingers 
over each other and wiggling the tiny 
toe which peeped through her sandals. 
“But what'll Mummy do? (Can she 
go too?” 

“O yes, your Mum could go and 
sleep with Grace. She doesn’t even 
have to go to. breakfast. Grace 
doesn’t!” 

Jeanne sat upright on the step, rock- 
ing backwards and forwards, and 
smoothing the wrinkles from her pink 
frock. Knox leaned back on his elbows 
and flung back his head to gaze rap- 
turously at the moon. “Want me to 
tell you a beautiful story, Jeanne?” 

“T love stories.” 

“Well, I'll tell you, one. Once 
upon a time, there was a little boy who

was very hungry. His mother was a 
nice lady and she had a big round 
cheese on her kitchen table. The little 
boy crawled into the kitchen window 
and looked so hard at the big round 
cheese! He wanted it, but he knew 
his nice mother wouldn’t give it to 
him, because she made things out of it. 
Then he stood upon a stool in the 
kitchen and took the cheese. After he 
got the cheese, he didn’t feel hungry, 
not one bit, so he . 


“Was he a bad little boy?” 


“O, wait, let me tell you. The little 
boy sat down on the grass with the 
cheese in his arms, and just sat and 
sat. He sat so long ’til a dark came, 
but it wasn’t a very dark like it is

SOME SPRING GLIMPSES 
HE thing that impresses me most 
in recent years about the col- 

ared schools is the increasing beauty 

of their equipment and surroundings. 

It used to be true that Negro institu- 

tions or their sponsors seemed to go 

out of their way to indulge in ugliness. 

I can remember the hare grounds and 

ugly halls of many an institution that 

I have seen in the past. 

Last month I went to Cheyney, 
Downingtown and Bordentown. Chey- 
rey is extraordinarily well-arranged. 
Its commodious buildings are con- 
structed of the same sort of stone and 
set thoughtfully on a beautiful campus. 
Small wonder that the birds like to 
sing at Cheyney and the flowers to 
grow. 

Downingtown is different. In build- 
ings it has as near nothing as a school 
could possibly have. It has a lovely 
rolling bit of land, a hundred acres in 
extent, which looks out upon the glory 
of southeastern Pennsylvania; but 
there is nothing on the land, save grass 
and lilacs; and yet the school is fascin- 
ating. It has only a hundred students 
and it has a well-trained little knot of 
teachers, modern folk and eager. And 
the result is shown in one incident—an 
incident curiously small and unim- 
portant in itself—and yet it made on 
me a tremendous impression. 

I was sitting in the Principal’s of- 
fee with him and the young woman 
who teaches English. The office is in a 
rambling old farmhouse, seventy-five 
years old, where the girl students have 
their dormitories. A student passed by ; 
a black, neat and ordinary looking 
slim student. She stopped at the 
door, looked in, and said to me quite 
casually ; 

“Oh, Mr. Du Bois, I enjoyed what 
you said this afternoon.” Then she 
smiled and went on. The Principal 
and the teacher continued the conver- 
sation. They had noticed nothing un- 
usual. But I was at once astonished 
and gratified. I have visited in the 
ast twenty-five years very nearly every 
Negro school in the United States. I 
do not remember another case where 
casually and naturally a student spoke 
‘0 a visitor in the presence of teachers

Springfield, *Mass. 


in an easy manner without any feeling 
on the part of anybody that the occur- 
rence was unusual. 

For the most part and in most 
schools, the discipline is so stiff, the 
distance between teacher and student 
so wide, the lack of real human touch 
and acquaintanceship so extraordinary, 
that ordinary things like this do not 

































happen. I had a feeling that at Down- 
ington this thing could happen because 
there were few students, good teach- 
ers, and that these two sets of human 
beings had a chance to become person- 
ally acquainted with each other. If 
any colored parent has a child that 
needs a teacher’s personal acquaintance 
and guidance, I suggest Downington 
to them. After all, what are build- 
ings? 

Bordentown is on the way of being 
the most beautiful colored school that 
I know. Today, its only physical 
rivals are Hampton, Tuskegee and 
Talledega. Hampton is getting to be 
too crowded and encumbered with 
buildings that have tumbled on to the 
campus without forethought. Tuske- 
gee needs a wrecking crew at points. 
Bordentown has been thought through. 
First, there is the water; that great 
bend of the Delaware that looks from 
the bluff like a silver lake. Then, 
there are trees. Trees that God made 
and trees that Mr. Valentine straight- 
ened. And finally, there are growing 
up at wide and comfortable intervals, 
a series of long, low and exquisitely 
proportioned dormitories. With grass, 
trees, water and harmonious buildings, 
the total effect is extraordinary. When 
once they raze that excrescence in the 
foreground called a “Shop”, Borden- 
town will be exquisite in its total im- 
pression. It has teachers too. 

And all these schools are high 
schools. I wonder if our educational 
attention is not shifting and ought not 


to shift from the college to the high 
school ? 


THAT EUROPEAN TRIP 
LMOST everybody expects to 
go to Europe sometime. Col- 
ored people with increasing frequency 
are making this trip. Perhaps a word 
from one who has been many times will 
not be out of place, especially as you 
are going this summer. 

First of all, you are going to have 
some difficulty in getting passage. It 
happens that just after the close of 
schools great numbers of middle-class 
Americans want to rush to Europe. 
They represent all of the energy, as- 
sertiveness and prejudices of white 


243 





Americans. They do not want to sleep 
in the same cabin with black folk and 
they would prefer not to be on the 
same ship. The steamship companies, 
therefore, at this time of the year, are 
a little careful about accepting colored 
passengers and have entered into some 
understanding by which the propor- 
tion is limited. You should, therefore, 
if possible sail at some other time of 
the year, and if this is not possible, 
make application early. There are 
many ships and many rival lines and 
they all want passengers. You can find 
passage if you keep at it. 

The cost of passage varies. Second- 
class on a large fast steamer or first 
class on a small and slower steamer 
will cost from $150 to $250.  First- 
class passage on a large swift steamer 
will cost anything you can afford to 
pay above $250. ‘Tourist’s Third” 
can be had for $100. 

First, and above all, do not try to 
see the world or even all Europe in 
one trip. Go to Paris and stop a 
month or two and come home. You'll 
get rest, diversion and information. 
Go to London and do the same. If 
vou absolutely must, combine London 
and«Paris. But for the love of God, 
do not try to do England, Holland, 
Germany, Switzerland, France, Italy, 
Spain and points North, East, South 
und West, in one summer vacation. It 
will do you no good and it will hurt 
Europe. 

Finally, remember that the colored 
American of taste and good manners is 
at a premium in Europe, while the 
white American is widely disliked and 
fleeced outrageously. Strive then, in 
contrast with our.national habit, to be 
soft-voiced, polite, leisurely and sym- 
pathetic. Remember you are going to 
a foreign land to see and know some- 
thing different. Do not then be as- 
tounded and critical and voluble when 
you find things different. 


THE PARKER FIGHT 
. "HE fight against the confirmation 
Oo 


f Judge Parker was initiated, 
planned and led by Walter White. 
Acting Secretary of the N. A. A, C. 
P. The publicity was in the hands of 
Herbert J. Seligmann who had the 
trained assistance of Miss Richetta 
Randolph, office secretary of National 
Headquarters, and her corps of stenog- 
raphers. The field work was done 
with the co-operation of the Director 
of Branches, Robert Bagnall and Mrs. 
Daisy E. Lampkin, and on the Pacitic 
Coast by William Pickens. The off- 
cials of the various branches through- 
out the United States gave every as- 
sistance and the Negro newspapers 
with scarcely a single exception, not 
only gave us space and good will, but 


244 


constant and efficient co-operation. 

Oscar De Priest, our only colored 
Congressman, not only drove Illinois 
into line with every ounce of his politi- 
cal power, but camped on the floor of 
the Senate to watch proceedings until 
the Southerners were nearly red- 
headed. One of the best known lead- 
ers of the Negro race and numbers of 
lesser men were begged to endorse 
Parker and refused. White newspa- 
per correspondents, headed by Hey- 
wood Broun, gave us unstinted aid. 
Certain Washington correspondents, 
whose names may not be mentioned, 
were constantly in telegraphic and tel- 
ephonic communication with head- 
quarters. 

The result was a campaign con- 
ducted with a snap, determination and 
intelligence never surpassed in colored 
America and very seldom in white. It 
turned the languid, half-hearted pro- 
test of the American Federation of 
Labor into a formidable and triumph- 
ant protest. It fired the labored lib- 
eralism of the West into flame. It was 
ready to beat back the enemy at every 
crisis. When the Greensboro News 
wired Overman that it had not printed 
the alleged speech of Parker against 
Negroes, March 4, 1920, the desks of 
the Senators were flooded next day 
with a photostatic copy of the paper 
with Parker’s exact words of April 19, 
1920. All the News could do in re- 
ply was to yell “Thief!” 

When the solemn Allen of Kansas 
discovered a Virginia decision of Par- 
ker in favor of Negroes, before the 
story got out of Washington our reply 
was on the wires showing that in the 
face of two unanimous Supreme Court 
decisions, there was absolutely nothing 
that Parker could do but acquiesce! 
So in every twist and turn of the en- 
emy, the battle was pressed down to 
the last minute. 

Especially did this fight drive Her- 
bert Hoover into the open. The Pres- 
ident has posed as wishing to clean up 
Southern politics and God knows they 
need it. In this attempt he secured 
the co-operation of the liberal West. 
Then, without protest, he allowed the 
whole campaign to degenerate into a 
simple attempt further to disfranchise 
Southern Negroes. Not grafters but 
Negroes he kicked out of the party and 
left the Creagers, Slemps and Hus- 
tons flourishing. When now Parker 
is shown to be in favor of Negro dis- 
franchisement, the President says not 
a single word, although he rushes into 
print to defend him against the attack 
of organized labor. President Hoover 
whitewashed the Red Cross in the 
Mississippi flood and ignored us on the 
Haitian commission. Any Negro who 
hereafter regards him as a friend of 
his race or as having even reasonable 


human respect for it, must have Proof 
which is not in possession of THE 
Crisis. He can only be regarded as 
Walter White says, as “The Man in 
the Lily White House”’! 

It was a fine fight, but we all know 
that it was only a beginning. By it- 
self and left to be forgotten it wil] 
amount to little. It must be followed 
up by the unflinching determination 
of Negroes to defeat the Senators who 
defied their vote and supported Par- 
ker. Nothing else will convince the 
United States that our gesture was not 
mere braggadocio and bluff. No Mas. 
sachusetts Negro dare vote for Gil- 
lett. No Ohio Negro can think of 
voting for McCulloch or Fess. Kan- 
sas must punish Allen, and Missouri 
must remember Patterson. And if 
black West Virginia this year or four 
years hence sends either Hatfield or 
Goff back to the Senate, they must no 
longer pose as free men but slaves of 
the Coal Trust. 

On the other hand, we must thank 
with our unfailing support men like 
Capper, La Follette, Norris, Walsh, 
Wagner and others who at personal 
sacrifice and despite the strongest pres- 
sure stood true to democracy regard- 
less of race. 

OUR 19TH EDUCATION 
NUMBER 


UR 19th annual Education Num- 

ber will be the August number 
of THE Crisis, ready for distribution 
July 15th. This number of THE 
Crisis has become in the years of its 
publication the most authentic record 
of Negro higher education published 
in the world. We want to keep it so 
and increase its accuracy and interest. 
For this very reason, we have had to 
change from time to time the customs 
of other years. There was a day when 
we could print in THE Crisis the pic- 
tures of practically every Negro col- 
lege graduate. Today, when over two 
thousand receive their degrees every 
spring, any attempt to print the pic- 
tures of all of them is of course impos- 
sible. We wish it could be done 
because the countenances of these 
young men and women are a revelation 
of intelligence and hope. As it is, all 
we can do is to print a few pictures, 
and we would like to print the photo- 
graphs of those who have received 
scholastic distinction of any sort; who 
have led their classes in scholarship in 
Negro institutions, and have been 
singled out in Northern institutions. 
We would like to print the photo- 
graphs of those who have received the 
higher degrees of Master of Arts and 
Doctor of Philosophy. Such photo- 
graphs should be sent to us immedi- 
ately and the photographs if used can- 
not be returned. We would like, too,

THE COMMISSION OF INTER- 
RACIAL CO-OPERATION 


E have every respect for the 

Inter-racial movement center- 
ing in Atlanta under the headship of 
Will W. Alexander. Mr. Alexander 
is one of the few white Southerners 
who has worked to make the inter- 
racial movement somthing more than a 
gesture and an excuse for inaction. 
The movement is now starting out to 
raise a Stabilization Fund of $1,360,- 
000, of which $500,000 has already 
been pledged. 

There is, however, some reason for 
raising a note of warning. Among the 
persons who are sponsoring this en- 
dowment we find many persons, who 
twenty years ago were telling Negroes 
they ought neither to vote nor to com- 
plain. There are others who have 
striven relentlessly in the last two dec- 
ades to confine Negro leadership prin- 
cipally to white folk. And there are 
still others of Negro descent who con- 
tinually let themselves be used as cats- 
paws and bell-wethers by enemies of 
the Negro race. 

It is reassuring to find, with these 
people, many folk of entirely different 
pattern; and yet, under these circum- 
stances, it is necessary to indicate 
frankly the program which any honest 
inter-racial commission working in the 
South must eventually face and carry 
out. 

This program has to do with a body 
of legislation which keeps Negroes in 
serfdom. For instance: the Negros 
have been disfranchised in the South 
by a series of laws based ostensibly on 
ignorance and poverty but enforced 
and administered on color of skin. 
Many of these laws included the her- 
editary right to vote for white folk. 
These laws were passed as follows: 


Mississippi . 1890 Virginia 1901

They should be repealed and re- 
placed by straightforward and honest 
legislation permitting citizens who can 
read and write, to vote regardless of 
race and color, 

In addition to this, the following 
states by forbidding the inter-marriage 
of whites and Negroes, are directly in- 
terfering with the institution of the 
family, encouraging prostitution and 
crime, taking away legal protection 


July, 1930 


from colored girls, making sex de- 
bauchery and license easy for white 
men, and putting a premium upon bas- 
tardy. The following states have such 
laws: 


Alabama Kentucky S. Dakota 
Arizona Louisiana Montana 
Arkansas Maryland Oklahoma 
California Mississippi Oregon 
Colorado Missouri Tennessee 
Delaware Nebraska Texas 

Florida Nevada Utah 

Georgia N. Carolina Virginia e 
Indiana S. Carolina West Virginia 
Idaho N. Dakota 


Either as a result of these laws or 
despite them, there are in the United 
States today at least 2,000,000 and 
possibly 5,000,000 Americans of mixed 
white and Negro blood. This legisla- 
tion should be entirely repealed. 

In addition to these fundamental 
enaccments to degrade and make help- 
less the black population of America, 
there are a series of laws designed for 
their personal insult and humiliation. 

“Jim-Crow” railroad car laws have 
been passed by states as follows: 


Tennessee 1881 Louisiana 1890 
Florida 1887 Alabama 1891 
Mississippi 1888 Kentucky 1891 
South Carolina 1898 Arkansas 1891 
North Carolina 1899 Georgia 1891 
Virginia 1900 Maryland 1904 
Texas 1889 Oklahoma 1907 


This means that in each one of these 
states a Negro passenger pays a first- 
class fare for second or third class ac- 
commodations; is carried in the most 
dangerous and dirtiest part of the 
train; is given the least comfort and 
protection, and is often open to insult 
and molestation from the occupants of 
the white smoking car. In addition to 
this, he is either denied or secures with 
difficulty Pullman accommodations and 
meals. This legislation is not only dis- 
crimination and insult—it is theft. 


Separate street car laws have been 
passed by the following states: 


Georgia 1891 Virginia 1906 
Louisiana 1902 North Carolina 1907 
Mississippi 1904 Oklahoma 1907 
Tennessee 1905 Maryland 1907 
Florida 1905 Oklahoma 1907 


These laws subject the masses of 
colored people, especially laborers and 
servants, to daily inconvenience, humil- 
iation and jeopardy of life and limb; 
while it compels the better class of col- 
ored people to buy expensive autmo- 
biles in order to escape insult and 
danger. 


All of these laws are a disgrace to 
a modern democratic government. 
There is no civilized country that has 
a parallel mass of legislation, except 
the Union of South Africa. This leg- 
islation ought to be repealed forthwith. 


It may be said that this is a counsel 
of perfection; that there is no chance 
of such action in the South for a gen- 
eration. Even if this is true, now is 
the time, this is the day to begin the 
campaign. It is the only program 
worthy of such an organization and 
such a munificent endowment. 


an 
Ce 





All of the above legislation is based 
upon and defended on account of the 
ignorance and poverty of Negroes. 
And yet the effort to remove the ignor- 
ance of Negroes is still largely a farce. 
With all that has been done by great 
organizations and foundations, even 
the most forward-looking state of the 
South, North Carolina, spends 20 
cents per attending pupil per day on 
her white children, and 10 and nine- 
tenths cents on her Negro children. 
While, on the other hand, the situation 
in South Carolina is much nearer the 
average of the South: this state, with a 
majority of Negro children, spends 
$15,000,000 a year for white schools, 
and less than $2,000,000 for Negro 
schools! 

Here, then, is a problem for a “sane 
approach to the race problem” in the 
South. It can not be forgotten; it 
can not be dodged. It is wrong to 
beg the question by calling the efforts 
of those who have in the past stood 
staunchly up for Negro rights, politi- 
cal, economic and social, ‘insane’ or 
illogical. 

We hope and expect that when the 
Commission on Inter-racial Co-opera- 
tion gets its great and needed endow- 
ment, it will thus immediately turn its 
attention to the final abolition of Ne- 
gro slavery in the South, as indicated 
by the above mass of legislation. 


THE ATHENS OF TEXAS 


EYWOOD BROUN has written 

so truthfully of Sherman, Texas, 
that his word cannot be repeated too 
widely: 

I had refrained from saying anything 
about the lynching in Sherman, Tex. It 
seemed to me that there was nothing to 
be said. This was a deed, I did assume, 
cruel and contemptible in the eyes of all 
men. No responsible person would 
stand up and condone the bestiality of 
the mob. 

But now I will speak, because to my 
utter amazement I find in as responsible 
a paper as the Atlanta Constitution a 
disposition to intimate that there is some- 
thing to be said for the pack. Indeed, 
it dignifies their deeds by captioning the 
editorial “The Sherman Avengers.” 

And the paper of Mr. Clark Howell, 
Jr. goes on to say: “The adherents of 
law and order may deplore and denounce 
these volcanic outbursts ot murderous 
rage, overriding all the instrumentalities 
of regular justice and the powers of 
government, but there is one great and 
irreversible fact ingrained in the psy- 
chology of the southern people that must 
always be taken into account by those 
who judge such events as this one at 
Sherman. That fact is that the white 
people will not tamely allow their wo- 
men to be the unavenged victims of the 
lust and brutality of any negro man... . 
Criticism of that passion and action 
from any soureg@bpeals only to the deaf-

ness of the adder, and no one can avert 
the terrible vengeance but the negro 
who keeps his lustful hands off an inno- 
cent white woman.” 

That is the most barefaced and 
shameless defense of lynching I have 
ever seen in a_ supposedly reputable 
American paper, and is founded not on 
one lie but two. First, there is the sug- 
gestion that the citizens of Sherman 
acted as they did through their deter- 
mination not tamely to allow their wo- 
men to go unavenged. 

Was that the issue? No honest man 
can maintain it. The culprit was al- 
ready in the hands of the law. His doom 
was fast approaching. He had con- 
fessed. Nothing but mob violence could 
possibly stay his execution. 

Indeed, the mob never succeeded in 
venting its wrath upon the thing that 
had been a man. It was a dead body 
which they burned and riddled with their 
futile and insane bullets. 

And the Atlanta Constitution would 
put the responsibility for this not upon 
the Negro criminal but upon alt Ne- 
groes. If the innocent colored people of 
the town had not fled they would have 
been killed, too. As it was, their homes 
and stores were burned. How can any 
intelligent person suggest that the atro- 
cious deed of one Negro makes all the 
members of his race subject to the fierce 
penalties of a savage mob? 

The Constitution speaks of “lust.” 
What name does it care to apply to those 
who sought to find satisfaction in har- 
rying and parading even lifeless flesh? 
I say that the dead man committed a 
horrible deed and that every member of 
the mob sinned against civilization in 
similar proportion. Was the lust of one 
ever yet sanctified and washed away by 
the lust of many? It is not a sectional 
issue. It is not an issue between white 
and black. The North has known the 
same violence and the same blood guilt. 
The issue is simply one between right- 
eousness and evil, between high heaven 
and the jungle. The man or men who 
behave like jackals under any compul- 
sion whatsoever are more than traitors 
to their race. They have betrayed the 
whole of human kind. 

This is not all: there has not been 
adduced evidence that would convince 
any court in a civilized land that the 
lynched man was guilty of anything 
but fighting for wages due him. If he 
had been hanged by law, there is rea- 
son to believe it would have been 
simply a legal lynching. 


OUR PRINTER'S DEVIL 
E keep our printer’s devil in con- 
finement with every reasonable 
attention. But now and then despite 
cur care he gets loose. Last month he 
had a small rampage. He insisted on 
saying, for instance, in spite of the 
Editor’s perfect knowledge, that the 
A. M. E. Publishing House of Phila- 
delphia which has gone into bank- 
ruptcy, belonged to the Zion Church, 
which of course it does not. 


246 





He also saw “by the pa-apers” that 
Judge Albert George and C. N. Lang- 
ston were defeated in the Chicago pri- 
mary for Judge of the Municipal 
Court and County Commissioner. 
This was untrue. They were tri- 
umphantly nominated, as the Editor 
ought to have known they would be. 

‘Then, sometime since, we published 
an interesting frontispiece and called 
it “Marco Polo’, when it ought to 
have been called Vasco De Gama. All 
of which shows the necessity of keep- 
ing strict watch upon the Devil. We 
apologize for him. 


CONSECRATED HYPOCRITES 
"T HE REVEREND B. N. BUR- 
RELL, pastor of the Second Bap- 
tist Church at Terre-Haute, Indiana, 
wished this summer to visit Egypt and 
Palestine. His friend, the Reverend 
P. O. Jenson of Chicago made the trip 
last year and is an agent for the Travel 
Institute of Bible Research, which is 
housed in Bible House, New York. 

Mr. Burrell is a world war veteran, 
served as Over-seas Secretary of the 
Y. M. C. A., and since then, has been 
for ten years First Lieutenant in the 
8th Infantry of the Illinois National 
Guard. Also, he is colored, while Mr. 
Jenson is white. He wrote Mr, Jen- 
son. Mr. Jenson was enthusiastic. He 
sent a booklet; told about cabins and 
meals, and added: 

“May I not ask that if you decide 
on a trip with Travel Institute that 
you will allow me to send in your name 
as I am acting as Agent.” Mr. Bur- 
rell hesitated, and asked THe Crisis 
to approach the Reverend Samuel H. 
Cuff, Executive Director at Bible 
House. Mr. Cuff replied: 


“As far as we are personally con- 
cerned, we make _ no_ discrimination 
against Americans of Negro descent 
joining our parties. However, there are 
certain other elements involved which 
make it extremely difficult for us to have 
them on our trips. For example, it 
would be necessary for them to engage 
an entire cabin. Secondly, it would be 
necessary for them to engage a room for 
themselves in all of the hotels and 
thirdly, it would be necessary for them 
to engage a private car in Palestine. The 
charge for such extras would make the 
cost of the trip practically prohibitive.” 

The Reverend Mr. Cuff weeps at 
this discrimination and offers to or- 
ganize a colored excursion, provided 
the steamship companies would allow 
it. The thing that really intrigues us 
is that private car to Jerusalem; and 
also we venture to quote from the pros- 
pectus: 

“The Travel Institute of Bible Re- 
search came into being as the result of 


the great demand for authentic Evan- 
gelical leadership in the field of Bible 


Study as related to the Historical Geo- 
graphical and Archaeological background 
of the Scriptures. It is a strictly non. 
commercial Christian Educational In- 
stitution, whose object is to encourage 
and make possible, by bringing the cost

BISHOP HURST 


OHN HURST, Bishop of the Af. 

rican Methodist Episcopal Church, 
has been a power for good in this 
world for more than a quarter of a 
century. He has stood for personal 
morality, public honesty, and efficiency 
in organization. He was not satisfied 
to work simply for his own advance- 
ment or even for the advancement of 
his own church, but as a member of 
the Board of Directors of the N. A. 
A. C. P., and in other responsible posi- 
tions he gave time, strength and 
knowledge to the emancipation of the 
Negro race and the uplift of mankind. 
The Board of Directors of the N. A. 
A. C. P. feel in his death not only the 
loss of personal companionship with a 
staunch friend and courteous gentle- 
man, but wish to record their grief at 
the passing of a great American citi- 
zen. 


INDIA 


T last Asia is rising again to that 

great and fateful moral leader- 
ship of the world which she exhibited 
so often in the past in the lives of 
Buddha, Mohammed and Jesus Christ, 
and now again in the life of Gandhi. 
We of the Western world have volu- 
bly professed that we believed in the 
cheek-turning ethics of Jesus Christ, 
but seldom, very seldom, have we tried 
it. Today, an attempt to conduct a 
great revolution, the object of which 
is the emancipation of several hundred 
millions of human beings, is being car- 
ried on by a program of passive resist- 
ance and civil disobedience. This 


mighty experiment, together with the. 


effort of Russia to organize work and 
distribute income according to some 
rule of reason, are the greatest events 
of the modern world. The black folk 
of America should look upon the pres- 
ent birth-pains of the Indian nation 
with reverence, hope and applause.

July, 1930 


Judge Parker 


(Continued from page 227) 


Supreme bench because he wished to con- 
solidate Republican gains in the South. 

Judge Parker’s strongest supporters 
are Democratic Senators from below the 
Mason and Dixon line. They are obliged 
to vote tor confirmation, because Negro 
organizations are against the nomination 
of the North Carolinian. The first rule 
of Southern politics among the lily whites 
is that you must be for anything which 
the Negro is against. 

Terrific administration pressure is be- 
ing brought to bear on all the rebels, but 
as yet Mr. Hoover has not taken the 
logical and necessary step to assure him- 
self of victory in the Parker fight. He 
should announce boldly that in 1932 he 
will run for Presidency as the candidate 
of undefiled Southern Democracy and 
under the indorsement of the Ku Klux 
Klan. 

Annie Nathan Meyer writing in the 
New York Times says: 

But now I know we have a strong 
President because he has decided to stand 
firm in the face of the opposition of labor 
and the Negro. After all, who are the 
workingmen that they should presume to 
dictate to the President of the United 
States? And what has got into the Negro 
that he thinks he has anything to say in 
the running of this country? The strong 
man knows when it is safe to be bold. 
Let us be thankful! 


The natural conclusion of many 
Southern papers is that this defeat 
means an end of the Hoovercrats and 
back to Democracy. The Rome, Ga., 
News-Tribune says: 

When the Negro voter has reached a 
point in political ascendency when he can 
dictate the make-up of the Supreme 
Court of the United States, it is a con- 
dition that well may give pause to the 
thoughtful people of the nation. This high 
tribunal is assumed to be free from racial 
as well as political and group influence, 
but the condition ceases to obtain when 
members must be satisfactory to the Na- 
tional Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People; an organization that 
is doing its level best to break down ex- 
isting standards and establish race equal- 
ity in America. . . . 

The Negro did not fight Justice 
Hughes and Justice Hughes was con- 
firmed. The Negro did fight Judge 
Parker and Judge Parker is turned down 
by the committee—turned down because 
a Congressional election is approaching 
and the Republicans need the Negro votes 
in doubtful states. 

This disgusting exhibition of fear and 
fawning, following upon the action of 
Mrs. Ruth Hanna McCormick in going 
into Chicago and advocating the re-elec- 
tion of the DePriest Negro to Congress, 
should certainly give pause to the South, 
some portions of which recently displayed 
a tendency toward the Republican party. 
The time has come for a rededication of 
Southern people to the Democratic party 
and a determined movement to restore it 
to power in the nation.

HE real significance of the vote 

is the degree in which it fore- 
shadows a union of forces between the 
Liberals and the Labor unions on one 
side, and the Negroes, on the other. 
There was no union of effort so far 
as the Parker vote was concerned. 
The American Federation of Labor in 
its rejoicing over the result, did not 
mention the Negro side, and few Ne- 
groes said anything about the Labor 
unions. ‘The Western liberals were 
silent on the Negro, although the votes 
of some of them were doubtless influ- 
enced by his attitude. Only Senator 
Wagner of New York made the preg- 
nant comparison in these words: 

“T see a deep and fundamental con- 
sistency between Judge Parker’s views 
of labor relations and his reported atti- 
tude toward the colored people of the 
United States. They both spring from 
a single trait of character. Judged by 
the available record, he is obviously in- 
capable of viewing with sympathy the 
aspirations of those who are aiming for 
a higher and better place in the world. 
His sympathies naturally flow out to 
those who are already on top, and he has 
used the authority of his office and the 
influence of his opinion to keep them on 
top and to restrain the strivings of the 
others, whether they be an _ exploited 
economic group or a minority racial 
group. 

Finally, we find no better ending 
and warning than this word of the 


Greensboro, N. C., Record: 


In so far as labor unions and the 
Negro race are concerned, they have 
achieved their most important victory in 
years, and we believe it will prove to be 
their most disastrous, especially in the 
South. The groups opposed to domina- 
tion by labor and the Negro are numer- 
ous, and they will see in this refusal of 
the Senate a real threat, and undoubtedly 
they will solidify their opposition to the 
end that these two factions may not be- 
come dominant throughout the land. At 
a time when union labor is preparing to 
invade the South with its hundreds of 
thousands of Negroes, the threat is very 
real, and the coalition between these two 
groups in this section becomes a peril 
which is deadly in nature and which can 
not but fail to arouse determined oppo- 
sition.

MY RACE 
Atpa TAYLOR 


NE question that should be given 

consideration and thought is, the 
race question. That is, what is wrong 
with the Negro Race? There are more 
people who are talking against the 
Negro race than it justly merits. 
These people by continual nagging and 
criticizing, are only displaying supreme 
ignorance. 

I am proud of my race. No other 
race has had to confront such diff- 
culties and obstacles. We have fought 
and we are winning. We have fought 
a battle for sixty-seven years, fearlessly, 
against prejudice and race hatred. 

Everything in this world has its good 
and its bad sides and the black race is 
valiantly making the best of the weaker 
side. 

We hear repeatedly that we do not 
stick together. I would like to sug- 
gest that the people who think the 
race is not working together as a unit, 
join the N. A. A. C. P. 

Our adults are becoming leaders of 
white men, therefore, showing that 
there is intelligence in the race and 
that many of our group too are poten- 
tial leaders. 

Our younger generations are seeing 
the difficulties of their forefathers and 
are overcoming them by education and 
magnanimity. A prominent saying is, 
Sink or Swim, Survive or Perish. No 
one can truthfully say that the Negro 
has not made rapid strides, swimming 
against the cruel tides of prejudice. 
Nor will he give up the struggle until 
he reaches the shore of freedom. 

Finally, may I add that one of the 
greatest influences for success is en- 
couragement. The intelligent people 
of the nation are wishing our race 
leaders continued success. We younger 
Juniors of the N. A. A. C. P. believe 
in you and are studying and preparing 
ourselves, for someday our chance too 
will come.
