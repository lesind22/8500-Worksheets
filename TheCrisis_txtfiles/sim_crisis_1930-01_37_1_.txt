A President Hoover called the real 
rulers of the land together and asked the 
Merchants and Superpower owners, 
the Transportation chiefs and all hirers 
of Labor to let the country go on being 
prosperous. ‘They said they would if 
they were not bothered by politicians. 
Which proves that the people rule.— 
It’s a Red Devil and a China-blue sea 
that face the Amalgamated White 
Peacemakers; if China yields, Russia 
rules; if Russia yields, China will turn 
her attention to other white owners of 
railways, factories and similar conces- 
sions.—Out of natural Jtalian curios- 
ity, the King has gone to see a Pope.— 
To sweep the dirts, the ladies’ skirts 
are drabbling dainty rags.—The last 
French soldier is out of Ehrenbreit- 
stein, die Wacht am Rhein, and the 
leading daily remembers the outrages 
of American soldiers on men and wom- 
en. Preach it brother, we blacks of 
Georgia and Haiti know!—New York 
will spend a half billion this year to do 
250 million dollars worth of work.— 
Seventy-five dead soldiers recently ar- 
rived from Russia. And by the bye 
what were they doing in Russia and 
when did the Russian-American war

begin and end ?—Our idea of the best 
joke of the season is the New York 
Times explaining how the stock crash 
was evidence of the essential sound- 
ness of American business.—Hel] is 
not paved with Sin but it’s paved all 
right.—If the Exalted Conferees of the 
London Naval Conference keep ex- 
cepting subjects of discussion, the Con- 
ference will eventually be confined to 
the color of the paint on the new ships. 
—We deeply regret to learn that Mr. 
Hoover is not descended from the no- 
bility. This, so far as we can learn, 
is true of no other prominent man.— 
Germany has paid 2,000 million dol- 
lars indemnity for the War out of 
nearly 2,000 millions borrowed of 
America.—The United States lost 85 
million dollars last year in running the 
Post Office while the munition makers 
gained 200 millions manufacturing 
gunboats and powder; which proves 
that the government can’t conduct 
business.—Commander Byrd paid a

—Judah Magnes is a brave man and 
true when he asks Zion for all men and 
not for one race; while England hav- 
ing promised sovereignty to both Jew 
and Arab is in her usual pickle of 
hypocrisy.—We don’t blame Mr. Stim- 
son for not directly answering Mr. 
Litvinoff: that note was unanswer- 
able-—The weary Tiger of France has 
earned his everlasting sleep—What 
we want to see is a little note from Mr. 
Stimson to Great Britain telling her to 
lay off on some of her little wars.— 
And tactful advice by France to the 
United States concerning Haiti—The 
Senate has again denied a seat to a Sen- 
tor because of fraud. Heflin, who 
holds a seat by greater fraud, voted 
against Vare. Blease, who was born in 
fraud, had the sense to vote for Vare. 
Hearken, dear Southerners, to the W. 
K. Mills of the Gods !—How easy it is 
to regulate wages and arrange industry 
and avert panics by vote of committees 
sitting in Washington, despite the ma- 
jestic and unalterable Laws of Supply 
and Demand. The committees, of 
course, must never be selected by popu- 
lar vote and William Green’s green 
labor must be dumb.—Tunney is try- 
ing not to be a mere pugilist and suc- 
ceeding indifferently.—The N. Y. 


Metropolitan Opera is looking for a

OU needn’t look so skeered, honey. 

I was jus’ a-movin’ dis here chair 
closer to de winder, so’s I could look at 
dem white lilocks a-growin’ down dere 
in yo’ yard. Dey’s real pretty, honey— 
real petty wid de sun a-shinin’ on ’em. 

You is de sheriffs’ wife, aint vou? 
I done seed you goin’ by on dat ole 
road what leads pass Mister Rankins’ 
house. I done watched you many a 
time out o’ de kitchen winder. I’se 
real sorry, honey, I done disturbed you 
fiom yo’ work. ’Cause whilse I’se 
here, I ain’t a-meanin’ to be no trouble 
—vyou done fetched vo’ tattin’ wid you, 
aint you, honey? Dat’s ’cause you is 
gwi’ sit a piece wid me, aint you? 
I'se glad, honey. De good Lawd 
knows, I was gittin’ kinder lonesome 
lak. 

It be real comf’table up here, though, 
—dis nice mattin’ on de flo’, an’ de cot 
so’s I kin lay down on an’ rest, an’ dis 
here easy-chair. I reck’n now, you 
thought to cheer a body up a bit, 
hangin’ dese nice yaller curtains, wid 
de blue-birds on ’em. Dey’s real 
pretty, honey. Dey hides, too, dem 
iron bars de sheriff’s done put ’cross de 
winders. Dey sho’ do make it pleasant 
in here, wid de sun a-shinin’ thoo em. 

An’ dem white li-locks—now. I 
was jus’ lookin’ at ’em, honey. I was 
jus’ lookin’ at ’em. . . She was plumb 
took way wid ’em, honey—my Eugenie 
—plumb took ’way wid ’em. Dat was 
my baby—Eugenie—honey. She be 
eighteen her las’ birthday, which was in 
March, pass. . . . An’ when he seed 
how wild she was ’bout ’em, he up an’ 
set out a whole lot uv’em in de garden 
what he done make fur her. 

"Twas lak a bit o’ dem woods what’s 
out back o’ his place, honey,—dat gar- 
den,—wild lak wid honeysuckle vines 
mos’ nigh hidin’ dem stone walls roun’ 
it, an’ wid birch trees an’ yaller dog- 
wood trees an’ flowers a-growin’ evah 
which-aways, an’ dem white li-locks. 
It was kinder nice, honey,—dat garden. 

I ain’t nevah set foot in it though. 
An’ he guessed I was skeered on ’count 
o' dey mought be snakes in it. An’ he 
laugh, an’ he say, dey wasn’t none out 
dere, ’cause he done took a stick an’ 
prodded all roun’ an’ he aint nevah 
foun’ none. . . "Pears lak, at fust, he 
nevah thought nothing "bout it.—how- 
come I done shun de place, an’ done 
kept to my room, ’cept when I was in 
de kitchen. . . It wasn’t on ’count o’ no 
snakes, nuther, honey. .. . 

I done spoke to Eugenie "bout it, dat 
she ought’n to do it, dat we ought to

go way. She wasn’t seein’ it her ole 
mother’s way, though. An’ seemed 
lak, I couldn’ bring mys’f to go ’way 
wid out her, honey... . 

Dey wasn’t no place fur me to go no 
ways. My pore Ellick done been dead 
three months, an’ me an’ Eugenie was 
stayin’ wid frien’s—dey done bu’nt up 
up ev-vy thing on de li’l plateau what 
we own, honey, whilse dey was huntin’ 
Ellick—when Mr. Rankin ax me to 
come an’ keep house fur him, lak I 
done fur his mother, befo’ him, an’ 
bring Eugenie wid me... . 

I done spoke bout it to Eugenie, 
honey. But she was’nt a-seein’ it her 
ole mother’s way,—dat dey was sin in 
it. I dunno—lI reck’n, I was’nt strict 
enough wid her. Seems lak I nevah 
could say much to my Eugenie, no 
ee 

Dey ain’t no-body evah knowed she 
was dere in dat ole house, honey. Aint 
no-body evah seed my Eugenie. He 
done fetched me an’ her here in one uv 
dem automobiles. We nevah knowed 
none uv de culled folks here in his 
town, honey. We be strangers here, 
me an’ my Eugenie. We nevah went 
no wheres—jus’ stayed on de place... . 
’Peared lak, he done talked to Eugenie 
befo’ he ax me to come an’ wuk fur 
him. 

Dey ain’t no-body knowed she was 
dere. Dat’s howcome, honey, dey’s a- 
‘cusin’ me fur what done happen to 
him. Dat’s howcome dey to fetch me 
heres... 

I done spoke to Eugenie, lak I say, 
honey. She was’nt thinkin’ ’bout 
nothin’ ’cept livin’ fur him, an’ bein’ 
happy, though. 

She was happy, honey—my Eugenie. 
She was happy, an’—him. I use to 
watch ’em in de evenin’ when dey’d be 
together in de garden. I use to watch 
’em—him, always quiet lak, an’ her 
a-stoppin’ to smell de flowers, an’ put 
her arms, wid de gold bracelets, he 
done give her, on ’em, roun’ dem white 
li-locks—An’ wid de blossoms brushin’ 
*gin her face, an’ fallin’ off an’ gittin’ 
caught in her hair—I watched her 
cause she was so happy, honey . . so 
happy, an’ pretty, an’ wild lak—jus’ 
lak de garden he done make fur her. 

Den some how—way after de li- 
locks done gone an’ ’twas de fall o’ de 
year—’peared lak sometin’ done come 
betwixt ’em. He was real uneasy lak, 
den. An’ he was’nt inclined to talk 
much, nuther. An’ days when he done 
come home early, he stayed out dere in 
de garden.—all unhappy an’ desperate 


lak,—’twel ’twas dark, diggin’ ’mongst 
de flowers. 

An’ Eugenie, she was all de time in 
her room. Only wasn’t she staying 
dere, a-crying? I done seed she was’nt 
aimin’ to let on lak dey was sump’n 
wrong be-twixt ’em. An’ I open her 
do’ soft lak. She was’nt a-cryin’ 
though. . . only sittin’ in dat big chair 
in front uv de fire place, wid de light 
a-flickenin’ on her an’ her head layin’ 
back lak she was restin’ all de 
time restin’ herse’f—an’ him in de gar- 
den, unhappy an’ desperate lak. 

Den one day, when de snow done 
come, an’ de garden was white wid it, 
he come up dem stairs to her room, a- 
fetchin’ her a li’l birch twig wid one o’ 
dem moth c’coons on it. I was in my 
room wid de do’ open, honey, an’ I 
heerd her when she speak—her voice a- 
tremblin’ kinder sad an’ kinder happy, 
too. An’ she speak ’bout how, when it 
done come spring a gin, when de flow- 
ers’'d be bloomin’, an’ dem white li- 
locks ’d be out, de pretty moth a-layin’ 
close an’ warm inside o’ de c’coon, 
would free itse’f an‘ come out... . 
Den she fell a-cryin’. An’ I heerd him 
a talkin’—trying to comfort her. An’ 
I knowed Eugenie was a-needin’ me. 
I knowed I could nevah go ’way an’ 
leave her dere by herse’f.... 

I couldn’t make it out cl’ar, honey, 
‘bout de wav she speak, an’ all. An’ 
I was a-tremblin’ an’ afeared. "Iwas 
lak de good Lawd done put a nudder 
cross on my shoulder’s fur me to bear 
an’ done put de trufe in my way wid 
it. Den I thought ’bout her pappy— 
I thought ’bout my pore Ellick. Den 
—I couldn’ listen, no mo; cause dey 
was somethin’ done commenced leapin’ 
up inside o’ me,—a tearin’ me to pieces. 

An’ when she done come to me wid 
it, honey, I coulddn’ hold in no mo’. 
She nevah say nothin’ at fust. though, 
*cause she knowed I was thinkin’ ’bout 
her pappy,—jus’ stood wid her head 
hangin’ down. . . Den—all o’ a sudden, 
she commenced cryin’ out fur me to 
stop, ‘cause she couldn’t stand me a- 
thinkin’ such things, an’ ’cause she 
wasn’t a-meanin’ to heap no mo’ 
trouble an’ werry on my head, an’ dat 
I couldn’ understand how it be wid 
her,—dat she couldn’t hold what’d been 
done to her pavpy, ’»in Mr. Rankin jus’ 
*cause it was his culla what done it. . . 

An’ den when Spring done come, an’ 
I seed her an’ him in de garden to- 
gether agin, an’ wid her so happy, I 
prayed de good Lawd to let her go on 
bein’ happy to let dat part o° dey sin

what was hers, be on my head. "Cause 
1 done suffered a lot a-ready anyways 
an’, I could bear it.... 

But He nevah seed fit to let my 
baby’s happiness go on, honey. When 
de flowers was all bloomin’ an’ de 
white li-locks done come—I was settin’ 
in her room a knittin’—dese ole han’s 
ain’t so quick lak dey once was—I was 
knittin’, an’ my Eugenie an’ him was 
at de winder a-lookin’ down at de 
garden. She was so happy, my Eugenie. 
. . . She was holdin’ out her han’ so’s 
de moth—it’d done come out o’ de 
c’coon, honey, an’ she was a holdin’ out 
her han’ wid it clingin’ to her fingers, 
so’s it could fly into de garden. An’ 
when it done got its strength, an’ gone 
off into de garden, she turned roun’ to 
him, an’ I seed she was’nt smilin’ no 
mo’... only looking sad lak, lak all 
her happiness done clean gone wid de 
moth into de garden .... An’ den she 
fell a-weepin’, wid him wid his arms 
roun’ her, a-trying to comfort her. . 

My Eugenie nevah smiled no mo’, 
honey. De good Lawd nevah seed fit 
to let her take up her happiness, agin. 
... An’ de li’l one,—it went away lak 
de moth. . . . My baby nevah got to 
hold it long in her arms. ... “. n’ den 
—she went—too. .. 


When I seed she was gittin’ low— 
when I done done all I could fur her, 
she ax fur him to come, dat dey was 
sump’n she wanted to say to him, by 
hisse’f. 

I didn’ go way, honey. I stood out 
side my baby’s do’, ’cause I knowed 
she mought be goin’ any minute... . 
An’ when he come an’ fetched me, 
agin, I seed her propped up wid pil- 
lars, an’ wid her bes’ dress—it was 
made out o’ yaller silk, honey, an’ trim- 
med wid beads—an’ her slippers, wid 
de gold ’broidery wuk on ’em—layin’ 
on de foot uv her bed. She made me 
put ’em on her, honey, wid him he’pin’, 
‘cause my ole han’s was a-shakin’ so.... 

Den layin’ dere, she make us burn 
up in de fire-place, ev’rything dat was 
hers. . . . Dey was a shawl she done 
wore out in de garden, when him an’ 
her was a-walkin’ dere an’ ’twas kinder 
cool. He pleaded wid her fur her to 
let him keep it, but she only looked at 
h#m sorrowful lak, an’ shook her head. 
. . . An’ he stood dere befo’ de fire- 
place wid his han’s behin’ him, an’ his 
head hangin’ down, watchin’ it burn, 
’twel she commenced pleadin’ wid de 
Lawd dat day was nothin’ left o’ her 
sin but herse’f, an’, she was ready to 
OD, © ss 

She looked lak a pretty bride—my 
Eugenie—honey. Dat was why she 
wanted de silk dress on, an’ de slippers, 
so’s she mought look lak one, ‘cause 
she’d nevah been none on earth. An’ 
wid de big basket uv white li-locks, he

done cut an’ brung up out o’ de garden 
fur her to look at, standin’ at de head 
uv her bed, an’ de li’l one a-layin’ in 
de holler uv her arm—my baby looked 
lak a pretty bride, honey. 

An’ den all de afternoon wid me a- 
standin’ by her bed a lookin’ down at 
her an’ de li’l one, an’ a-listenin’ to de 
soun’ o’ his hammerin’ an’ sawin’, 
down dere in de cellar— 

I seed den honey, he was’nt aimin’ 
fur nobody to know ‘bout my Eugenie 
an’ de lil one. But I couldn’t go 
down dem stairs to him to hinder him. 
..+1 couldn’ do nothin’. I couldn’ do 
nothin’ but stand dere at de foot o’ 
my baby’s bed, an’ look down at her 
an’ de li’l one. ... 

When he done come up agin to my 
Eugenie’s room, an’ done took her up 
oft’n her bed, an’ in his arms—her an’ 
de li’l one—she look lak he mought be 
jus’ carryin’ her, wid her li’l one down 
to de garden to set dere in de sunshine 
an’ look at de flowers, an’ dem white 
li-locks. Only—I knowed honey, she’d 
nevah open her eyes no mo’, an’ it done 
got dark in de garden. . 


It peared lak, honey he seed den 
how ’twas wid me. I ’spec’ it come to 
him den, too, how it had been wid me 
all along. ’Cause he drapped his head 
down, an’ he say dat she done make him 
promise to do it, when she done speak 
wid him, by hisse’f. . . . An’ den I 
couldn’ stand no mo’, honey, de things 
dat was leapin’ up in me fur me to say 
to him. But I couldn’ say nothin’, 
nuther, fur I couldn’ make ’em out, 
dey done all turned black in my head. 
I couldn’ make out nothin’ only, dat 
I done fell down on my knees ’cause 
my strength done left me, an’ dat my 
ears was full o’ de soun’ uv him a- 
walkin’ down dem stairs, wid my baby 
an’ her li’l one in his arms... . 

*Peared lak honey, he’d nevah git to 
de bottom uv dem stairs. . nevah 
git thoo carryin’ my baby an’ de 1i’l 
one, down .... an’ down... . an’ 
down.... 


An’ den, I heerd him a-hammerin’, 
a0... 


An den I couldn’ heer nothin’ but 
de soun’ uv de wind a-blowin’ thoo de 
trees out dere in de garden.... 


It done commenced gittin’ day out- 
side, honey, an’ a drizzlin’ rain done 
set in, when he come back up dem 
stairs to my Eugenie’s room. An’ he 
walked lak he was a fetchin’ her an’ 
de li’l one back, agin. But when he 
stood in de do’, I seed he was by hisse’f. 
An’ he act lak he nevah seed me. He 
stood dere a-clutchin’ de do’ wid both 
han’s lak he was afeared o’sump’n. Den 
bracin’ his han’s ’gin de wall, he 
walked roun’ to de big chair in front 
o’ de fire-place. An’ when he done 


come to it, he shrunk down in it an’ 
bowed his head in his han’s, 

I got up off o’ my knees den, honey. 
An’ when he heerd me git up, he reared 
his head up wild lak, an’ commenced 
shakin’ all ovah an’ mumblin’ sump’n 
—I couldn’ make it out—an’ twistin’ 
his han’s together ... . Den he riz up 
out o’ de chair, only he drap down on 
his knees befo’ it, lak his strength done 
gone from him. An’ den, all de time 
a-mumblin’ sump’n, only now it ’peared 
lak he was a moanin’, too, ’cause sump’n 
inside o’ him done start hurtin’ him, he 
drug hisse’f long side my Eugenie’s bed. 
An’ he took hold on de basket uv li- 
locks wid both his han’s, an’ turned 
to her bed, wid her an’ de li’l one gone, 
an’ commenced cryin’ out fur her to 
open her eyes, fur her to look at de 
white li-locks—lak she was still a-layin’ 
dere. "I'wasn’t long, though, fur he 
fell to mumblin’ agin—mumblin’ an’ 
cryin’, wid his head bowed down 
’mongst dem li-locks, *twel it done 
come ovah him dat my baby couldn’ 
evah answer him, no mo’, couldn’ evah 
look at dem white li-locks, no mo’. An’ 
den, honey, he fell to tearin’ ‘em to 
pieces an’ to cursin’ de good Lawd 
‘cause He done took Eugenie an’ de 
li’l one away . 

I seed den how twas wid him. An’ 
I got afeared. I knowed I couldn’ do 
nothin’ wid him by myse’f, so I run 
to fetch him he’p.... 

Honey, I wasn’t a-runnin’ ‘way 
when dey found me on dat ole road. 
I was jus’ a-goin’ to fetch him he’p. 
Only—I done got turned roun’ lak I'd 
nevah been on dat ole road befo’. I 
wasn’t a runnin’ away lak dem what 
foun’ me ‘lows I was ‘cause I done 
done sump’n to him. I ain’t nevah 
knowed nothin’ *bout conjurin’ folks, 
honey. No mo’n dem what ‘lows I 
done it. But ’cause dey found me a 
wanderin’ long dat ole road in de rain, 
an’ wid only my ole shawl an’ dis ole 
flannel wrapper on—’cause dey foun’ 
me dat a-way, an’ dey foun’ him a 
kneelin’ side her bed wid dem li-locks 
all torn up, an’ a-callin’ her name, an’ 
pleadin’ wid her, an’ dey ain’t nevah 
foun’ nothin’ what’d sho’ my Eugenie 
been a-living dere, too—dey ‘lows I 
done put all dat on him, an’ dat dey 
could’n a-been no-body in dat ole house 
‘cept me an’ him... . But I nevah 
done nothin’ to him, honey... . I 
done suffered a lot, but it ain’t nevah 
make me want to harm no body... . 

An’ I been a-thinkin’, too, honey,— 
he must a-loved my Eugenie lak he'd 
love one o’ his own women kind, fur 
dem li-locks to turn him dat awav.... 

Dem growin’ down dere in yo’ yard 
—now. Dey’s real pretty, honey, wid 
de sun a-shinin’ on ’em real 
pretty—an’ cheerin’ lak.

N the December Crisis we published 

the first installment of this ar- 
ticlee Mr. Matney studied the re- 
stricted occupations of Negroes and 
discrimination in expenditure. He 
then made a brief study of Negro busi- 
ness and shows how it was handi- 
capped in competition with the chain 
store. He then turned to agriculture 
and concluded that the Negro was not 
holding his own there, asserting that 
Negro agricultural schools “have not 
solved and will not solve the prob- 
lem of Negro success on Agriculture.” 
He continues: 


Agriculture does not lead an in- 
dependent and isolated existence. It 
is part of a larger mechanism, both 
physical and pecuniary, which inter- 
relates all branches of economic activ- 
ity. The prosperity rests upon a deli- 
cate balance between those who live on 
the farms and those who live in the 
cities. It rests upon a delicate balance 
between transportation, manufacture, 
commerce and agriculture itself. The 
sensitive equilibrium of the great in- 
dustries may be considered under the 
following heads :** 

1. The balance of farm income with 

general income. 

2. The balance of farm accumula- 
tion with the accumulation of 
wealth. 

3. The balance of population be- 
tween agriculture and industry. 

4. The balance of production be- 
tween agriculture and industry. 

5. The balance of farm prices with 
other prices. 


“Farming for white and black today 
in the United States is a failing, un- 
profitable business; and the efforts to 
help it—farm credits and farm relief, 
—are not for Negroes”.!® The real in- 
come of the farmer has normally been 
less than the real income of the re- 
maining industrial population.'* 

During the most favorable period in 
American agriculture, the average per 
capita income on the farm was only a 
little more than one-half that of the 
people engaged in other major indus- 
tries. In the worst years, as for ex- 
ample in 1920, the farm income is less

Exploitation or Co-operation? 


By W. C. MATNEY 


George Foster Peabody writes 
of the first installment of this 


article in the December Crisis: 
“IT must also congratulate your 
readers and I hope the readers of 


many papers which will have the 
wisdom to quote or reprint the 
excellent article by W. C. Mat- 
ney, whose mentality intrigues me 
as I read this most worthwhile 
presentation.” 


than a third as much per capita as the 
income of other classes. For instance, 
it is found that if in the year 1913 the 
farmer had gone to work as a laborer, 
his average labor income would have 
been $444 instead of $328, as it was. 
If he had worked as a miner instead 
of as a farmer, he would have received 
$755 or about 70 per cent more than 
the income for his labor received on 
the farm.?7 Hence farm classes have 
never acquired riches from returns on 
their labor, because they have received 
on the average lower income than the 
workers in other occupations. The 
only income which the farmer has re- 
ceived resembling a profit has been the 
pure appreciation of his land value. 

The dreams of wealth held by the 
Negro agricultural school, and which 
it widely advertised, have been rudely 
shattered by the alternating inflation 
and deflation of land values, and by the 
changes in the general price level at 
the same time as the changes in farm 
prices have occurred. 

The future position of agriculture, 
and the position of Negro agriculture 
in particular, cannot be prognosticated 
with any degree of accuracy, since both 
are controlled by many unknown fu- 
ture conditions. 

The present farm aid is not for the 
Negro. Future prospects for the Ne- 
gro farmer, based on the past and pres- 
ent, are not encouraging. 


Position of the Negro Restated 


The present economic order may 
be sketched in a single picture: (1) 
the institution of private property, (2) 
free enterprise, (3) competition. The 
right to acquire, use and dispose of 
property is the strong incentive to pro- 
duce goods. Free enterprise allows 
each fellow to follow his own self- 
interest. The natural accompaniment 





170. E. Baker, 
March, 1923 


American Economic Review, 


of free enterprise is competition. In 
short, the economic order has as its 
basis, opportunity. Into this economic 
order we find the Negro first intro- 
duced as a slave and denied all rights. 
Today he is slave of the industrial and 
commercial order by virtue of the in- 
dustrial and commercial restrictions 
and denials imposed upon him. He 
lives in a competitive age but must not 
compete in a competitive market. In 
the meantime, the economic institu- 
tions remain the same with a steady 
output ef wrongs, distress, troubles and 
injuries. 


Reform Necessary 


It is evident that the Negro is suf- 
fering from conditions in the economic 
order over which he has no control. 
The question naturally arises, how can 
relief be obtained, or what is the way 
out? 

All problems of economic improve- 
ment are fundamentally two-sided; on 
one hand, they necessitate the altera- 
tion of institutions to better fit human 
nature; and on the other hand, they 
necessitate education of human nature 
to better fit institutions. The opinion 
of the writer is that the economic im- 
provement of the Negro requires eco- 
nomic adaptation between these two 
factors. The reform should not be 
merely a gift from society to a needy 
group, but an organization of oppor- 
tunity for self-achievement, and for 
race advancement by the creative effort 
of all members of the group. The re- 
form must reshape the economic order 
of the Negro and eliminate the insti- 
tutional difficulties under which he is 
now suffering. In other words, the re- 
form must give the Negro an economic 
order over which he can exercise con- 
trol as a free being in the economic 
order. This can only come through in- 
dustrial and commercial undertakings 
owned and controlled by the Negro. 


Requirements for Control 


O own and control industrial and 

commercial undertakings requires 
four basic factors: land, labor, capital 
and management. Land includes all 
natural resources,—crops, minerals, 
water, lumber. Land supplies the raw 
materials of production, and affords 
the opportunity for the extractive in- 
dustries. Labor includes labor of 
brain as well as labor of hand. The 
mental tasks are specialized, and per- 
formed by highly trained engineers, me- 


11 


Spas Is aA A

chanics, and executives. The manual 
tasks require obedience to orders and 
instructions worked out by manage- 
ment. Capital includes machinery, and 
all articles of value used for further 
production. Money is the productive 
agent. Management _ co-ordinates 
land, labor and capital into a going 
concern. 

Under the present industrial and 
commercial regime it is next to im- 
possible for the Negro to acquire the 
above factors in sufficient quantities to 
enable him to become an economic fac- 
tor in American competition. As has 
been stated, exploitation and restricted 
occupational opportunity is the weapon 
used on the Negro. This being true, 
the Negroes’ only real competition in 
business is with Negroes. Here, in re- 
cent years, he finds that large scale 
business is stepping in and sharing the 
Negro business to the detriment of the 
Negro competitors. The economic 
position of the Negro makes it impos- 
sible for him to meet the competition 
of the big business concerns. 


A Way Out for the Negro 


HE way out for the Negro is not 

by revolutionary methods but by 
evolution of his present economic or- 
der. He must build for himself an 
economic order that will enable him to 
be a power as a Negro race. This 
means an alteration of his present eco- 
nomic institutions to fit his defined 
needs, on the one hand, and on the 
other hand, a change in the point of 
view of the Negro to fit his changed 
economic institutions. 

Co-operative industrial and commer- 
cial enterprise is the basis on which the 
Negro can become an economic power. 
It is the method by which the Negro 
race can marshall its forces in the 
most effective manner for the good of 
the race. It is the method by which 
Negroes can get control of natural re- 
sources, produce on their own farms, 
do their own manufacturing, distribute 
through their own stores, have their 
own banks, and not be controlled by 
the prejudice of the white man’s eco- 
nomic order. It is the method that 
will give diversification in business and 


4n industry. All Negroes are con- 
sumers, and all Negroes would be 


owners in the co-operative-economic or- 
der, owning and buying from them- 
selves, working thereby for themselves, 
promoting the welfare of the race. This 
would give the Negro financial, indus- 
trial, and economic activity that is im- 
possible otherwise. 


Co-operative Business Explained and 
Demonstrated 


a BUSINESS is 
mutual aid on a business basis. 
The members of a co-operative busi- 


12 


ness own the business, conduct it them- 
selves (through a Board of Directors), 
confine their patronage to the business, 
and receive the profit-returns from the 
business on the basis of their purchases. 
A group of people with a common in- 
terest get together and form a co-op- 
erative society. Each member takes out 
a share of stock in order to provide the 
capital with which to start the enter- 
prise. Each shareholder has one vote, 
regardless of the number of shares he 
has. A Board of Directors is elected 
te carry on the affairs of the group. 
Interest on capital stock is fixed at the 
current legal rate. Goods are sold the 
members for cash and at the current re- 
tail prices. Operating expenses are de- 
ducted, and a reserve fund for emer- 
gency is set aside. After this has been 
done, the remaining surplus-saving of 
the business is returned to the members 
in proportion to the purchases they 
have made with their co-operative so- 
ciety. 

Co-operative business is not a fanci- 
ful theory but a practical method of do- 
ing business for mutual aid ;—a meth- 
od employed by other exploited groups 


similarly situated like the Negro. 
For instance: In a _ certain town 
seven hundred people organized a 


co-operative society for the purpose 
of operating a co-operative store. 
Each person put in $10, making 
a capital of $7,000. They confined 
their purchases to their store, paid cur- 
rent prices and did a business among 
themselves amounting to $140,000 for 
the year. There was a net profit of 
$5,500. The average purchase of each 
member was $200. He received back 
$8. He had invested $10. That is 80 
per cent return. Furthermore, these 
people had given employment to some 
of their own group and were controll- 
ing a business institution. Multiply 
these stores and other co-operative un- 
dertakings, and one can readily see how 
the Negroes as owners, consumers and 
producers can control a chain of co- 
operative enterprises from retailing all 
the way back to the natural resources. 
By applying certain methods in a small 
way, a small co-operative society is 
built. By uniting many co-operative 
societies, and using the same natural 
methods, a great co-operative society is 
evolved. By expanding into more and 
more fields the social structure is grad- 
ually changed into a co-bperative struc- 
ture. 


Extent of Co-operative Business 


The soundness of the co-operative 
movement has been demonstrated in 
Europe and America (36 countries of 
the world) by a stable and steady 
growth for three quarters of a cen- 
tury. 

It would be difficult to mention any 


useful business of kind of service not 
undertaken by co-operatives. Bulletin 
number 437 of the United States Bu- 
reau of Labor Statistics, gives $500,- 
000,000 for annual sales for consumer 
co-operatives in 1925. This figure 
does not include agricultural co-op- 
eration. With the figures for agricul- 
ture added, the total co-operative busi- 
ness for 1925 is in excess of two bil- 
lion dollars. 

Kinds of Co-operative Business in 

United States 

Retail distributive stores are the 
most common co-operative enterprises 
in the United States. There are about 
2,000 of these, with a total member- 
ship of about 750,000 and a total turn- 
over of about $100,000,000 a year. 

Co-operative insurance in the United 
States is found especially among farm- 
ers. It is highly successful. They 
carry insurance exceeding $6,000,000,- 
000 on property valued at over $7- 
000,000,000. This insurance is carried 
at one-half the rate charged by profit 
making companies. 

Milk distribution has been devel- 
oped successfully. The Franklin Co- 
operative Creamery Association, in 
Minneapolis, has 6,000 members and 
$3,500,000 worth of milk yearly. 

Co-operative bakeries have been 
highly successful. The Eastern States 
have 16 bakeries which use 60,000 bar- 
rels of flour a year. 

Co-operative housing has been highly 
successful in New York City and 
Brooklyn. Around five thousand fam- 
ilies are housed in true co-operatives 
in New York and Wisconsin. The 
property value runs into millions of 
dollars. 

Co-operative gasoline and oil stations 
are a recent development in the co- 
operative movement. 

A co-operative cafeteria in New 
York City, has five branches, 120 em- 
ployees, 2,000 members and _ serves 
3,000 meals a day. The annual busi- 
ness is over $500,000. 

The Co-operative Central Exchange 
at Superior, Wisconsin, is a wholesale 
composed of sixty societies. This or- 
ganization conducts a school for the 
training of co-operative executives. 
The Central Wholesale of Nebraska 
distributes seeds, flour, feed, coal, gro- 
ceries, dry goods, clothing, hardware, 
machinery, and other goods. There 
are several small district wholesales. 


What shall we do about it? 
After further figures concerning 
co-operation abroad and a compari- 
son of private retail stores and co- 


operative stores, Mr. Matney will, 
in the February Crisis, conclude 
these articles by telling how co- 
operation can be established among 
American Negroes.

THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 








Hon. H. H. Lehman, Lieutenant-Governor 
of New York 


WHEN CHAMPIONS PASS 


N the history of the National Asso- 

ciation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People, the year 1929 will be re- 
membered as one of heavy losses. The 
man who was its President from the 
very beginning, who assumed the office 
when it required courage to do so, 
passed peacefully away at the age of 
85 vears. With the death of Moor- 
field Storey went the Association’s last 
link with that stormy time when the 
nation was shaking itself free of 
slavery. For, as everyone knows, Moor- 
field Storey was secretary during the 
troubled Reconstruction period to 
Senator Charles Sumner. 


That Mr. Storey was one of the 
most eminent lawyers in the nation, 
formerly a President of the American 
Bar Association, as well as of the bar 
associations in Boston and Massachu- 
setts, a governing officer of Harvard 
University, a leader in the movement 
for civil service reform, only made his 
stand for the rights of the American 
Negro the more dramatic. He added 
his own elements of drama by helping 
to win the famous Grandfather Clause 
case, by which this flagrant form of 
disfranchisement was outlawed by the 
United States Supreme Court. And 
the classic case on residential segrega- 
tion, Buchanan v. Warley, known as 
the Louisville Segregation case, by 
which cities and states are prohibited 
from establishing Negro ghettoes, was 
also argued and won by Mr. Storey 
before the Supreme Court. 


This same champion procured from 
the United States Supreme Court in 
the Arkansas Peonage riot cases, a de- 


January, 1 930 








cision establishing that trials conducted 
in an atmosphere of mob domination 
do not constitute the due process of law 
required by the Constitution ; a decision 
which safeguards the legal rights of all 
citizens, black and white alike. 

The recital of victories and achieve- 
ments familiar to colored people 
throughout the country and to white 
people desirous of decent race relations 
and of justice between the races, makes 
all the more clear and vivid the loss 
which the Association has sustained. 
It is one which can hardly be made 
good. 

So too with the death of Louis Mar- 





T. G. Nutter 


shall, member of the Association's 
Board of Directors and of its National 
Legal Committee, who gave unstint- 
ingly of the resources of a brilliant 
legal mind to the problems of the Asso- 
ciation. Mr. Marshall, in the last few 
years of his life, participated in those 
dramatic legal contests before the high- 
est courts in the land, where the citi- 
zenship status of millions of colored 
people were at stake. It needs only to 
name the victory in the Texas White 
Primary case, safeguarding the ballot 
of the Negro and of all minority 
groups, the struggle against residential 
segregation by covenant among prop- 
erty owners, the Richmond segregation 
case and the Virginia White Primary 
case, in all of which Mr. Marshall par- 
ticipated, to show how active and in- 
tense his interest in the Association's 
work was. 

Other champions besides Mr. Storey 
and Mr. Marshall, the National Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Colored 
People has lost during the year. There 


me 


is Dr. Charles E. Bentley, of Chicago, 
one of the earliest supporters of the 
Association, a devoted member, who 
was always ready to be called upon in 
its service. He, too, contributed the 
prestige of renown in his profession. 
He was president for years of the Or- 
thodontic Society. And though he was 
a colored man, white patients flocked 
to his dental office to avail themselves 
of his skill. 

Last but not least in the list of va- 
cancies made by death on the N. A. A. 
C. P. Board this year, is that of Paul 
Kennaday. Mr. Kennaday had wide 
connections in practical affairs. He was 
one of the directing spirits in a press 
news service which served the world. 
Through his contacts as well as by 
reason of his loyalty to the aims of the 
Association, he was one of the main- 
stays whose passing leaves a sad gap. 

Despite these irreplaceable losses, the 
Association goes on. It goes on 
strengthened, if anything, by the 
thought that if the idea it represents, 
is vital enough to survive such losses, 
if it can attract to it new champions 
to carry on the work of the fallen 
leaders, then there is hope indeed for 
the future. And the Association is for- 
tunate indeed to be able to report new 
additions to its ranks, of names hon- 
orably known throughout the nation. 

At the moment of writing, four such

HERE is a legend that colored 

men can not rule over white 
communities without disaster,—disas- 
ter brought by their own incompetence 
and by the supposedly natural dis- 
taste of white people for colored folk 
in authority. 

The United States of America is al- 
ways pointed out as peculiarly exempli- 
fying this situation. But like all gen- 
eralizations, the statement never was 
wholly true and is growing less and 
less true. There have been from 
earliest times Negroes occupying posi- 
tions of authority in America, some of 
them obvious and well-known posses- 
sors of Negro blood; others passing for 
white. At present, the number of 
American Negroes in official positions 
is large and growing. And this article 
indicates a few of them but by no 
means all. 


First and foremost, comes the Ne- 
gro member of Congress, Oscar De- 
Priest, from the First District of Illi- 
nois. .Mr. DePriest was preceeded in 
Congress by two Negro Senators, Hi- 
ram Revels, 1870-1871, and Blanche 
K. Bruce, 1875-1881. There were 21 
colored members of Congress, who sat 
in various sessions from the 43rd to the 
56th. With the defeat of George H. 
White of North Carolina, through the 
disfranchisement laws, there was a long 
hiatus until Mr. DePriest was elected 
in 1928. 

There are today fourteen or more 
Negro members of State Legislatures. 
Illinois leads with four, followed by 
Missouri with three and New York 
and Pennsylvania with two each. Sin- 
gle members sit in California, Ohio, 
West Virginia and New Jersey. IlIli- 
nois, in addition to her four members 
of the Lower House, has one colored 
State Senator, the only one in the 
United States.

Two Southern Court Cases 


T is notorious that Negroes obtain 

justice in Southern courts with 
great difficulty, particulaily if one of 
the parties is white. But the following 
cases show that a change is coming, 
and that persistent determination, legal 
talent and a just cause are beginning

to have a chance, even in Georgia and 
South Carolina. 

Readers of THE Crisis may remem- 
ber that in our issue of August, 1927, 
we recited the case of Dr. C. A. Spence 
and his wife in Atlanta, Georgia. 
Briefly, the facts were as follows: 


Dr. Spence is a dentist, and his wife 
a pharmacist. They were riding on a 
street car, when a dispute arose be- 
tween the conductor and a colored pas- 
senger concerning transfer. Suddenly, 
the car was stopped, and the conductor 
velled: “Every damn Nigger get off!”

Dr. C. A. Spence 


All of the Negroes, except Dr. Spence 
and his wife, rushed out, and as they 
emerged, were beaten by the employees 
and white bystanders. Dr. Spence and 
his wife remained quietly in their seats. 
When they refused to move, they were 
first attacked and beaten, and then ar- 
rested. The Spences secured two col- 
ored attorneys, A. T. Walden, Presi- 
dent of the Atlanta Branch of the 
N. A. A. C. P., and a former Captain 
in the A. E. F., and A. W. Ricks. The 
case was remanded to the Superior 
Court from the Recorder’s Court, and 
seven months later, Dr. Spence and his 
wite were acquitted of the charge of 
disorderly conduct! 

Most colored people in the South 
would have been glad to stop here; but 
not the Spences. They not only sued 
the street car company, but against 
strong advice, retained their colored 
counsel. The colored firm secured a 
white firm to assist them, and went 
into court. On Wednesday, October 





Ben Bess 


January, 1930 


23, three years after the original argu- 
ment, and after a three-day trial be- 
fore ex-Governor Hugh M. Dorsey, a 
verdict of $1,500 in favor of Dr. 
Spence and his wife, was handed down 
by the court. Dr. C. A. Spence is a 
British subject, a native of Jamaica, 
and a graduate in dentistry of Howard 
University. He has been practicing in 
Atlanta since September, 1925. His 
wife was born and educated at Cor- 
dele, Georgia, and is a graduate of 
Meharry. 


The other case is the celebrated one 
of Ben Bess, in South Carolina. Ben 
Bess owned a large farm and one of 
his tenants was a white family, named 
Collins. Bess was accused of having 
raped the wife, Maude Collins, and 
was sentenced to the penitentiary for 
thirty years, in 1915. 

In the spring of 1928, Maude Col- 
lins confessed that she had lied in her 
testimony against Ben Bess. The case 
aroused widespread interest and on 
recommendation of the State Solicitor, 
the Governor suspended the sentence 
of Bess during good behavior, and he 
was released from the penitentiary on 
May 4th. On May 12th, he was given 
an unconditional pardon. 

Meantime, the white people of Flor- 
ence were mad and busy, and threat- 
ened to indict Maude Collins for per- 
jury. Mrs. Collins immediately de- 
clared that she had only intended to 
say that she “forgave” Bess and that 
as a matter of fact he was guilty. On 
June 21, the Governor suggested that 
Bess re-enter the penitentiary for his 
own security, but he was not allowed 
to depart when he wanted to. 

In July, the intrepid colored attor- 
ney, N. J. Frederick, who rendered 
such splendid and self-sacrificing ser- 
vice in the case of the lynching of the 
Lowman family, instituted habeus 
corpus proceedings to have Bess freed. 
Two days before the return of the 
writ, the Governor revoked the par- 
don of Bess, on the ground that it was 
obtained by fraud and misinformation. 

The case came up August 23rd _be- 
fore Judge Townsend. He undertook 
to investigate and pass on the question 
of fraud and misinformation, but the 
attorney contended that he had no 
right to consider this matter, since Bess 
had been pardoned and a pardon could 
not be revoked. Nevertheless, the 
Judge remanded Bess to the peni- 
tentiary and ordered the Master in 
Equity for Richland County to take 
testimony on the question of fraud and 
to report. 

The Master found that no fraud 
had been perpetrated and that while 
Mrs. Collins may not have under- 
stood the full purport of the affidavit, 
no unfair advantage had been taken of 
her in the transaction, and that she had 





Mrs. D. A. Spence 


not repudiated her statement until 
threats of prosecution had been brought 
against her. 

The Attorney General of the state 
filed exceptions and on August 23rd, 
the Judge ruled that notwithstanding 
the Master’s findings, that fraud had 
been practiced in the transaction and 
that because of the fraud the pardon 
was void. The prisoner, therefore, 
would have to be sent back to the 
penitentiary. 

Appeal was made to the Supreme 
Court, and argued November 12, 
1928. No decision was rendered, but 
on October 12, 1929, in an en banc 
session of all the Circuit Judges with 
the Supreme Court, a re-argument was 
made, with the result that the judges 
agreed in reversing the lower court and 
decided by a vote of nine to seven that 
the revocation of the pardon was il- 
legal, and that Bess must be freed. On 
October 15, 1929, Bess was discharged 
from the penitentiary and left the same 
day for Pennsylvania.

GRAPHIC description of the 

proceedings at the Palace of Jus- 
tice states that on April 22, 1929, the 
day of the trial of the well-known and 
militant Nationalist editors, George 
Petit and the youthful Jacques Rou- 
main,—twenty-one years of age,—the 
Palace was surrounded by military 
forces under the command of Ameri- 
can Marine officers, the troops being 
distributed even along the neighboring 
streets. Within the court itself U. 5S. 
officers were standing armed with re- 
volvers and filled cartridge belts. 
Among the Marine officers were 
Major Murray, Chief of Police, Cap- 
tain Shafter, Assistant Chief and Lieu- 
tenants Leveque, Steele, Usher and 
Detro. 

At each window of the courtroom 
two Haitian constables were on guard, 
and immediately behind the Judge an 
American officer Belton by name and 
a Frenchman called Bonté were sta- 
tioned. Bonté is brutality personified 
and generally supposed to be a former 
Frenchconvict. He is in charge of the 
Haitian Secret Service, a man of mys- 
tery, mysteriously landed in Haiti. 

When the two young Nationalists 
were escorted to the Court Room prac- 
tically all the seats were already occu- 
pied by government employees and 
spies. Lawyers were denied the cus- 
tomary reservations and as the Judge, 
a puppet of President Borno and Gen-

eral Russell, had ordered that no one 
could stand, other visitors were forced 
to leave the room. It is unnecessary 
to say that the government and the 
American authorities were acting in 
vicious violation of our Penal Code 
procedure and of Article 96 of the 
Constitution which provide in the 
matter of Press Offenses, that the hear- 
ings must be open to the public and 
this without any restrictions whatso- 
ever. 

A few minutes after ten o'clock the 
trial began. It was so impressive that 
the spies and government employees 
corralled there for the added purpose 
of interrupting the statements of the 
accused, remained silent before the 
vigorous eloquence of young Roumain, 
explaining his reasons for having re- 
ferred to Borno as a traitor to Haiti 
and a tool of American Imperialism. 

At the conclusion of the trial, some 
lawyers and the sister of young Rou- 
main arose to tender their congratula- 
tions to Monsieur Frech Chatelain, of 


The President's Palace, Port-au-Prince. 


counsel for the defense, for his magnifi- 
cent address in behalf of these two 
Nationalist editors. As Roumain, in 
turn, was extending his arms to greet 
his sister he was seized by the Ameri- 
can Lieutenant Belton. A_hand-to- 
hand encounter between the two men 
ensued during which the brute Bonte 
attempted to shoot Roumain with his 
revolver and was prevented only by the 
intervention of one of the lawyers, M. 
Hermar Maletrandre. Then Bonte, 
not to be denied, inflicted with a club 
a severe wound on the head of Rou- 
main, blood being spattered to within a 
few feet of the Judge’s seat, without 
regard for the sanctity of the Court or 
of Haitian justice. 

Instead of being protected by the 
court an accused, submitting to trial, 
is assaulted by a spy. 

Those who believing he was being 
murdered came to the rescue of Rou- 
main were beaten with clubs by the 
Haitian constables under command of 
American officers. Roumain was hur- 
ried to the City Hospital and subse- 
quently returned to the prison in which 
he and Petit had already, preceding 
the trial, been confined for five months. 

Their paper, Le Petit Impartial, has 
been suppressed. They were con- 
demned and sentenced each to one year 
in the Haitian Bastile, and each to a 
fine of one thousand dollars, and in

THE BROWSING READER 








WHO WILL WRITE THE 
OTHER SIDE? 
ISTENERS-IN to the Demo- 


cratic National Convention at 
Houston last year will remember the 
staccato and partisan rhetoric with 
which the temporary Chairman, Mr. 
Claude G. Bowers, Editor of the New 
York Evening W orld, opened the pro- 
ceedings. Mr. Bowers has now pro- 
duced an equally staccato and partisan 
history of the Reconstruction period, 
which he calls ‘“The Tragic Era’. It 
has been highly praised as a “well- 
documented” study based on indus- 
trious research, and Mr. Bowers’ pre- 
conceived conclusions have been ac- 
cepted by some so-called “reviewers” 
as demonstrated proof after the man- 
ner of a Euclidean proposition. 


These conclusions—I state them in 
my own, not the author’s words—are, 
briefly, that the Southern states were 
cruelly abused by Congress and the 
carpetbag governments that Congress 
supported; that the plan of President 
Johnson was a righteous one; that the 
attempts of one Southern state after 
another to enforce vagabondage laws 
that would have set up a condition of 
peonage scarcely distinguishable from 
the slavery it had taken four bloody 
years to overthrow were justified ; that 
unrestricted Negro suffrage was an 
outrage; that any kind of equality— 
political, legal, social—between the 
two races was properly fought to the 
bitter end; that the Southerners were 
patient under persecution till patience 
ceased to be a virtue; that reports in 
Democratic newspapers of those days 
of misdeeds by Negroes were truthful 
and accurate while reports in Repub- 
lican papers of abuse of Negroes by 
whites were inventions or grossly ex- 
aggerated; that the leaders in the 
North of the fight to make abolition 
real were either insincere and crooked 
or were crazed by fanaticism while 
their opponents were patriots and 
statesmen all. Even the Ku-Klux 
Klan is applauded, though Mr. Bow- 
ers must still smart from the remem- 
brance of what that order, resurrected 
but unchanged in spirit, did for the 
defeat of his own Presidential candi- 
date one year ago. The “historian’s” 
imposing list of sources cannot conceal 
the fact which he himself makes clear 
in his footnote references that his book 
is the product mainly of diligent 


January, 1930 





search in old files of the copperhead 
New York Herald and the partisan 
New York World. The Bowers book 
licks the hands that smote Alfred 
Smith in 1928, and as a Democrat and 
a Smith man who believes that until 
the Democratic party dares to cut 
loose from the burden of Southern 
Bourbonism that has crippled it so 
long and to demand fair play for na- 
tive colored Americans as well as for 
foreign-born whites and their imme- 
diate descendants, it will contrive to 
meet deserved disaster, I protest 
against the author’s implications. 

Who will write a clear, impartial 
history, free from passion and race 
bias, of Reconstruction and the Negro’s 
part in it? Is there not here a worthy 
task for an American historian of 
African ancestry? Or, if this be ask- 
ing too much, who will write the Ne- 
gro’s side of the story written by Mr. 
Bowers from the viewpoint of the 
Negro’s despisers? Mr. Bowers’ im- 
plicit thesis is that the Fourteenth and 
Fifteenth Amendments in their rela- 
tion to suffrage and human equality are 
wrong. In rebuttal let the explicit 
thesis be that they are everlastingly 
right and that the white South never 
did a worse thing for herself than 
when, with the connivance of both 
political parties, she attacked and 
scuttled them. Mr. Bowers repeats ad 
nauseam that the former slaveholders 
understood the Negro best and were 
his best friends. In rebuttal let it be 
shown that they understood him worst 
and—with all due praise for such be- 
nevolence as they extended to the ser- 
vile Negro—that they were (and their 
spiritual descendants are) the worst 
enemies of the Negro struggling to- 
ward manliness and equality with his 
fellows.

BURSTING BONDS 


URSTING BONDS is an auto- 
biography I would like to put 
in the hands of every boy and girl 
in our country. Mr. Pickens writes 
with simplicity and directness of his 
struggles as a boy against the worst 


handicaps any human being can face:. 


race prejudice, illiteracy, poverty, and 
lack of opportunity. Over these seem- 
ingly insurmountable obstacles to free- 
dom, this Negro boy climbs to heights 
of attainment that take him from a 
wretched share-farm cabin in Arkan- 


a 


sas to Phi Beta Kappa honors and 
prize orator at Yale. 

Reading this story puts backbone 
into one’s vertebrae, enlarges the finer 
sympathies of the soul, increases hope 
in the goodness of men, and deepens 
the longing for that day when all- un- 
privileged boys and girls, especially 
those denied common justice, may 
come to their own. 

Dealing, as Mr. Pickens is forced 
to in his life story, with the problem 
of race prejudice, he is remarkably free 
from bitterness. Every man and wo- 
man interested in bettering race re- 
lations between the white and colored 
races of our country, will find inspira- 
tion in these pages; every father and 
mother hoping for their children as- 
pirations to high ideals and friendly 
attitudes, will find time well-spent 
reading this book in the family circle. 
My own children were thrilled by this 
story, while it proved a window 
through which they were enabled to 
see and understand the heart-throbs of 
thousands of boys and girls not of their 
race but of their common humanity, 
heirs with them of American citizen- 
ship in this great hour. 

There is no field in American life 
today, where religion has so utterly 
failed to create the spirit of brother- 
hood and understanding as in this 
realm of race-relations. Every church 
in the land should see to it that their 
young people are encouraged to read 
this book. If the religion of Jesus can- 
not lead us out of our miserable preju- 
dices, based solely on color and pride 
of race, its great Founder will have 
failed so far as American Christianity 
is concerned.

I looked for you; but the wan sprinkled 
light 

Of stars was all I saw—and linking 
trees 

And dogwood blossoms twisting in the 
breeze. 


Fevered all 


All that I heard were cries of hidden 
things, 

And the loose beating of Death’s scrawny 
wings 

Behind the moon; these things were all I 
heard— 

Never the sound of footsteps or a word. 

Long hours I watched. Long hours I 
called your name 

Into the night’s suspended purple flame 


Yet all my cries fell through the air to 
bring . 
The worse-than-silence of their echoing.

Vagaries in August; sturdy trees; 

Galleons in summer clouds which yet

Ready for a voyage upon celestial seas. 

Tall grasses; garden paths; banjo tunes 
at dark; 

Rich cadences of a young girl’s song; 

Mating cries at morning, from lark to 
lark; 

Melodies which linger in the soul all day 
long. 

A square or so of land whereon to grow 

Stronger, finer, wiser. These things I

Black Love 
By BEATRICE ROBINSON 


Is was the “big town” sheik 
When she first came. 

Back home; there hadn’t been a soul 
Like Jim. 

When he kissed her—it thrilled. 

She felt funny when people gazed 

At her and Jim; 

But he was fair. 

Let them stare. 

Hadn’t he asked her to marry him? 


Three years had passed; 

Jim had lost his job, 

And there were three children, 
Twins and Teena-baby. 

So when Jim took sick, 

She had to take in more washing. 
Sometimes until after midnight— 
She ironed. 

But she still loved Jim... . 
Even tho’ he got drunk sometimes. 


And then the other baby came, 

But Jim was working 

At a foundry. 

So things were easier, 

Less washing to do;... until... 
One day she got a note. . 

Jim was dead. 

An accident at the foundry. 

They sent his body home. 


Years had passed since then. 

The twins and Teena-baby worked. 
She didn’t mind living. . . . 

She had a big son— 

Just like Jim.

@ National Negro Public Health 
Week will be observed March 30 to 
April 6, 1930. A preliminary confer- 
ence concerning the matter was called 
by the Surgeon-General of the United 
States Public Health Service, last Oc- 
tober. It was attended by a number 
of white and colored experts. 


@ The work of the John F. Slater 
Fund in encouraging county training 
schools is strikingly illustrated by the 
latest figures. In 1912, there were 
4 such schools, with 20 teachers, and 
77 high school pupils. In 1928, there 


January, 1930 








were 328 such schools, with 2,379 
teachers, and 14,092 pupils in high 
school grades. During the same period, 
salaries have increased from $3,344 to 
$1,269,228. Of this latter sum, the 
Slater Board has contributed in 1928 
$100,675 and the General Education 
Board, $45,164. The rest came from 
public funds. 

@ The forty-five thousand striking 
dressmakers of New York City have 
invited the four thousand Negro dress- 
makers to confer with them and to 
join their union. Only a few hundred 
Negroes now belong to the Union and 
most Negroes receive $15 a week in- 
stead of the $40, which is the scale 


in the Union shops.

@ The Harlem League of the Greater 
New York Federation of Churches has 
been organized. It is studying con- 
ditions and finds that wages are too 
low, health bad, and the proportion of 
arrests by the police high. On the 
other hand, some of the _ largest 
churches in New York are located in 
Harlem and there are many welfare 
agencies.

A., the President of the Kiwanis Club, 
and many distinguished citizens. 

q@ W. A. Tooks, a colored man of 
Philadelphia, began to manufacture 
coffins in 1921, with a capital of $350. 
He has now property valued at $50,- 
000, employs seven men, and manu- 
factures 2,100 caskets annually, using 
more than four carloads of lumber. 

q W. H. Phillips, a colored con- 
tractor of Charlotte, North Carolina, 
has secured the contract for the brick, 
tile and stone work on the medical and 
surgical building at St. Elizabeths’ 
Hospital, Washington, D. C. 

@ At the State Conference of the W. 
C. T. U., New Jersey, Mrs. Gertrude 
W. Cannon, an extension worker, 
was awarded the prize for an address 
on how to overcome the efforts of 
groups organized to overthrow the 
18th Amendment. 

@ The effort of Morgan College to 
raise funds has resulted in $125,627 
being collected from colored people and 
$433,583 from educational funds, the 
State of Maryland and white friends. 
With the money collected, the debt has 
been paid, Baldwin Hall has been 
built, a water system installed, and a 
new Science Hall begun. 

@ Lincoln University has an enroll- 
ment of 350 students. The largest in 
her history. A new dormitory to cost 


$150,000 is needed. The General 
Education Board has appropriated 
$50,000. The Carnegie Corporation 


of New York has donated $25,000 for 
the purchase of new books for the 
library. 

@ John Wanamaker, Jr., announces a 
Third Contest in Musical Composi- 
tion for Negro composers. There will 
be four sets of prizes: First, for a song;

Negro spirituals; and the fourth, for 
choral work with band accompaniment. 
The prizes in the first Three Classes 
are $150 First Prize, and $100 for the 
Second Prize. In the Fourth Class, 
there is one prize of $250. 
@ The Allied Art Center of Boston

and Germany, and at a slight addi- 
tional cost, either England or the 
Oberammergau Passion Play. 
@ Twice last month white men with 
faces blackened as Negroes have com- 
mitted crimes. In Savannah, one 
such youth robbed an automobile, but 





The Eldest Son 


was knocked off and killed. Another, 
in Norfolk, attacked a white woman 
in her room but was knocked uncon- 
scious. In both cases, the assailants 
were discovered to be white. 

q@ O. K. Armstrong, special writer

Louis Dispatch, has shown that Ne- 
groes in lumber and naval camps are 
bought and sold for $50 to $150 a 
head in certain parts of Florida. 

@ The Insurance Commissioner of 
North Carolina has refused to allow 
the colored Pythian Grand Lodge to 
borrow money in order to pay their 
indebtedness to the Supreme Lodge. 
The Grand Lodge has been suspended 
for nearly two years. The Ohio 
Grand Lodge is protesting the pay- 
ment of its dues. All these difficulties 
arise because of the cost of the Pyth- 
ian Temple in Chicago.

THE MIDDLE WEST 
@ Neisner Brothers, a Five and Ten 
Cent chain organization, have stores 
with entire colored personnels in De- 
troit and in Chicago. 
@ The colored Masonic Temple at 
40th and State Street, Chicago, has 
been sold for debt. 
@ Bishop A. J. Carey of the African 
M. E. Church and his former private 
secretary have been indicted in Chi- 
cago for accepting bribes from can- 
didates for promotion in the Police and 
Fire Department. He is free on a 
bond of $25,000. 
@ Cleveland has a city manager and 
proportionate representation for the 
election of councilmen. This enables 
minority groups, like the Negroes, to 
secure full representation. The politi- 
cians have wished to change all this 
and have an elected mayor and coun- 
cil chosen by wards. In order to con- 
sider these proposals and make some 
needed changes in the charter, a Char- 
ter Commission has been appointed. 
On this Commission, the Honorable 
Harry E. Davis, a colored man, now a 
member of the Civil Service Commis- 
sion and formerly for many years a 
member of the Legislature, has been 
appointed. 
@ Charles Bowles, who was elected 
Mayor of Detroit, had the whole- 
hearted support of colored citizens be- 
cause of his promise to remove Police- 
Commissioner William Rutledge, who 
has allowed the wanton shooting of 
many colored men by the police. 
@ For a second time, a court has de- 
cided against the validity of clauses in 
deeds which prohibit sale to colored 
people. The first case was in West 


January, 1930 


Virginia and the last in Columbus, 
Ohio. There Joseph Bulen, a white 
real estate dealer, tried to oust Mrs. 
Daisy Rice from her home in the 
Bulen Allottment. Mrs. Rice pur- 
chased the lot seven years ago and re- 
cently erected a brick house at a cost 
of $25,000. The lawyer for the com- 
plainant declared that there was a na- 
tional organization of white real estate 
men to prevent Negroes from buying 
certain properties. The Judge threw 
the case out of court. 

@ The Julius Rosenwald Fund has 
been awarding Fellowships to promis- 
ing Negro students with a view to pre- 
paring them for different lines of 
work, either in teaching or in other 
lines of public service. The Fund is 
prepared to consider persons recom- 
mended, particularly in the fields of 
public health, library training, home 
economics and vocational agriculture. 
Such candidates are sought by con- 
sultation with the president of schools 
and colleges with a view to helping 
them to improve their faculties. The 
Fund thus quietly seeks the best peo- 
ple and does not wish to encourage 
personal applications. 

@ Former City Councilman, Thomas 
W. Fleming of Cleveland, has secured 
a review of his case by the Supreme 
Court of Ohio. He was convicted of 
bribery. 


THE NORTH WEST 
@ The State Board of Medical Ex- 
aminers of Michigan, by unanimous 
vote, has placed Meharry Medical 
College on a basis of reciprocity with 
all other medical colleges of Class A 
standing. This rule was made retro- 


active to 1923. 








@ To Willie Gertrude Brown should 
go the credit for the new $100,000 
brick building dedicated as the Phillis 
Wheatley Settlement House in Min- 
neapolis last October. Five years ago, 


Miss Brown began the work in a small 
frame structure, assisted by the Y. W. 
Cc. A. A bequest of $10,000 from the 
late Mrs. F. H. Wellcome, a white 





Mock Wedding at Zion Methodist Church, 
Jamaica, Long Island 


woman, started the Building Fund 
and led by Mrs. James Paige, a repre- 
sentative in the State Legislature, a 
campaign during the summer of 1928 
resulted in cash donations sufficient to 
build the present institution. The first

floor has a gymnasium and an assembly 
room with a stage, a library, music 
room, day nursery and offices. On 
the secgnd floor, is a men’s reception 
and game room and living quarters 
for the resident workers, with nine- 
teen bedrooms. In the basement, are 
game rooms for boys and girls, athletic 
rooms, carpenter shops, showers, laun- 
dry and a community kitchen. 

@ Miss Brown, the Head Resident, 
was born in Charlotte, North Caro- 
lina, and has been connected with vari- 
ous forms of social service throughout 
the country. She came to Minneapolis 
from Dayton, Ohio. 


MIDDLE SOUTH 


@ Mrs. H. R. Butler of Atlanta, 
Georgia, has been made a member of 
the White House Child’s Conference 
and will serve on the Committee on 
the Infant and Pre-School Child. Mrs. 
Butler represents the National Con- 
gress of Colored Parents and Teach- 
ers. 


@ The Chase Science Hall at Fisk 
University has sustained a damage of 
$30,000 by fire. The loss is partially 


covered by insurance. 


@ Joseph DeJoie, who recently died 
in New Orleans, was the son of Jules 
DeJoie, a chef on the Mississippi 
river steamboats. Joseph was born in 
1881, educated in the public schools 
of New Orleans, and at Southern Uni- 
versity and New Orleans University. 
He was married to Louise Borel in 
1904 and opened his drug store in 
1908. At his death he was Treasurer 
of the Louisiana Independent Life In- 
surance Company and manager of two 
drug stores. He had ten children, 


24 


three of whom are working in his drug 
stores, and seven are in school and col- 
lege. 

“We who knew Joseph Dejoie inti- 
mately, knew his head to be clear and 
habituated to clear thinking; we knew 
his heart to be big and generous. His 
contributions to charity were many. A 
Catholic by birth and training, he did 
not restrict his gratuities to its chari- 
ties alone. He had the broader view 
that made all mankind kin. Perhaps 
he was even better known by that host 
of people farthest down, those of hum- 
ble circumstances. He was adviser and 
helper to many of them in the intimate 
things which touched their lives. 

“No better tribute to the worth of 
any man could be accorded than to see 
hundreds of these people crowd the 
house and church and with tears of 
honest feeling streaming down their 
cheeks, just to get a last look at the 
friend that was gone.” 


SOUTH WEST 


@ John H. Lewis, for eight years 
President of the Morris Brown Col- 
lege, Atlanta, Georgia, is now Prin- 
cipal of the High School and Junior 
College at Little Rock, Arkansas. This 
college will soon be housed in a mod- 
ern building costing approximately 
$500,000. The General Education 
Board and the Rosenwald Foundation 
are helping in the project. 

@ Dr. Thomas A. Crump, of 
Phoenix, Arizona, made the second 
highest mark of the examination of the 
State Dental Board. He is a graduate 
of the University of Southern Cali- 
fornia, and is the third colored dentist 
to take the Board Examination in the 
last ten years. Out of a class of forty, 
only seventeen passed. 

@ Laurence A. Tillis of the 24th In- 
fantry has been awarded a medal for 
courage in rescuing four soldiers from 
drowning at the peril of his own life. 


PACIFIC COAST 


@ Fifteen students of the McCoppin 
School, Oakland, California, took part 
in a spelling bee. Phyllis Foreman, 
colored and eleven, won the contest. 
For the last two years she has taken 
prizes in French.

Officials at St. Etienne, page 21 


@ Mrs. J. M. Scott of Los Angeles,

for twenty years. 

@ In Tobago, the Negroes have de- 
veloped 13 agricultural districts on a 
co-operative basis. 

@ In Barbadoes, B. W. I., Negroes 
have no chance to own land and are 
used as a reservoir of common labor. 
In Granada, on the other hand, there 
are 14,000 small Negro landowners.

YOUTHPORT 





For Juniors of the N. A. A. C. P. 





EFFie LEE Newsome, Critic 








ELL, here it is, Youthport, 
done by youth. We have se- 
lected four essays and a drawing from 
New Jersey, the District of Columbia, 
Ohio, and California. 
Our editorial staff for the first half 
of 1930 will be: 
Editor: Agnes J. Laws 
Assistant {Elizabeth Carter 
Editors: |Alda Taylor 
Art Editor: Eleanor Paul 


How Youthport Shall Be Con- 
ducted and What It Shall 
Aim to Do 


I am to be Youthport, and I am 
going to be conducted by various 
Junior Divisions all over the country. 
These groups are going to send in ma- 
terial to help build me up and make 
me strong. They are going to send in 
such material as poetry, history of some 
Negro hero, pictures of themselves, 
and original drawings, and tell of the 
work they are doing in their particular 
group both social and educational. 

I am also to have a manager whose 
name is “Editor”. His duty is to man- 
age all my business affairs. He re- 
ceives all my contributions from the 
groups and criticizes them, then picks 
out the best work and publishes it. I 
am then ready to be read. Of course 
I am going to be interesting. The 
Juniors will see to that. They will 
put in me the best they can, so that 
every young person will be glad when 
they know I am going to be present 
every month in the Senior Crisis. 

I am going to try to teach the young 
people some of the heroic and noble 
deeds their race has done and is doing. 
I am going to try to awaken in them 
an abundance of race pride so they may 
be proud of her at anytime and before 
afly other race. I am going to try to 
instill in them, that because their face 
is black is not sufficient reason why 
they are not entitled to their rights of 
life, liberty and the pursuit of happi- 
ness. Then I am going to try to in- 
duce them to do everything in their 
power to better themselves and others 
so that our race may thrive and be- 
come great through their efforts. 

Through you, Juniors, these things 
can be accomplished. Help me with 


i . 
all your might. 
. . Acnes J. Laws, 


Long Branch, N. J.

Youthport should be conducted in 
such a way as to create and maintain 
the live interest of young folks every- 
where. It should aim to provide a 
genuine motive for achievements in the 
line of literary art. Our race is greatly 
in need of skillful writers and artists. 
And, if we offer sufficient inducement, 
our group perhaps will give to the

world someday a representation, whose 
achievements the world will regard as 
worthy of every recognition. 

I suggest that Youthport, the di- 
vision which is turned over to the jun- 
iors, contain the best selected short 
story, a poem, a book review, a brief 
autobiography, and last but not least, a 
drawing. 

Let it be our policy, too, to be on 
the alert to secure subscriptions to our 
magazine. Let the juniors as well as 
the seniors talk to their friends, and 
explain Youthport to them. Certainly, 
there are many who will be eager to 
support our section. It is up to us to 
make it a success. I most heartily wel- 
come the opportunity to do my bit. 

ELIzABETH CARTER, 
Washington, D. C. 


Youthport is going to be the most 
interesting magazine because undoubt- 
edly we juniors are going to make it 
so. We say “I Will” and stick to it. 


I would suggest the following ar- 
rangement: 


There should be several pages of the 
Crisis Magazine set aside for the work 
of the Junior division of the National 
Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People. On the first page in 
the left-hand corner should be listed 
the names and addresses of the execu- 
tive committee. The remainder of 
this page will consist of interesting in- 
ternational reports. Next, space should 
be given for the work in various states 
which might be divided into sections, 
for instance, Northeast, Southeast, 
Northwest, Southwest, or, numerically, 


sections I, II, III, IV. 


Pictures and written accounts 
should be sent in of the most outstand- 
ing Junior member. The best and 
most interesting reports of each four 
sections will be presented on the re- 
maining pages. This will prove a val- 
uable incentive to other Divisions and 
will enable members to become ac- 
quainted with each other. 


In order to be outstanding one must 
have excelled in membership drives and 
various campaigns for funds or will 
have played leading roles in whatever 
he or she has been exceptionally active. 


The topics will vary according to the 
type of activity throughout the four 
sections, the newly organized divisions 
and individual division accomplish- 
ments. Poems and works of literature 
and art that express ability should be 
published on this page. 


The aim of this department should 
be to engender new interest in the 
branches; to instill in other Negro 
youth the desire and ambition to be- 
come a part of this great crusade in 
the cause for justice. Indeed, Youth- 
port should be such a vital and im- 
portant section that it will greatly in- 
crease the sale of THe Crisis and be- 
cause of this department we will have 
a bigger and better magazine. The 
pages devoted to the work of the Jun- 
ior Division will not only prove an in- 
spiration to the Negro youth through- 
out the country but it will serve to edu- 
cate the reading public that they may 
know the Negro youth of today have 
picked up the torch and are pushing 
onward and upward in the struggle 
for justice and democracy.

GREETINGS 

O all those who have helped to 

make THE Crisis what it is, by 
writing for it, by buying it, by reading 
it, by sending it to their friends and by 
criticizing it frankly either favorably 
or otherwise, we send the greetings of 
the season in the 20th Year of its life. 
May you have A Happy Christmas 
and A Successful New Year; may you 
have health and love; may you do to 
others even as you would that others 
do to you and may you continue to 
serve every high ideal and help every 
worthy cause.

You have done a great work for your race—-and for all races in the 


United States. 


You have sometimes preached strong and unpalatable 


doctrine, and urged aggressive movements which have not seemed to me 


always practicable. 


That makes no difference with the essential 


which 





is that yoy have been a standing representative of the intellectual power 
of Negroes. I count you among the chief American writers of your day, 
and trust that some of your books will be read in years to come, as a 
statement of conditions in a critical time for the Negro race. You are an 
extremist—and so was William Lloyd Garrison.

HE ink was scarcely dried on our 
announcement last month that 
the Fifth Pan-African Congress 
planned for Tunis, French North 
Africa, could not be held on account of 
paucity in attending numbers, than we 
received additional reasons for post- 
poning the Congress. Gratien Can- 
dace, French Deputy from Guadeloupe, 
and Acting President of the Congress, 
writes us under date of November 15: 
“Je vous envoie, ci-joint, copie 
d’une lettre du Ministére des Af- 
faires Etrangéres de la République 

Francaise, concernant le Véme Con- 

grés Pan-Africain. 

“Le Gouvernement Francais ne 

tient pas du tout a ce que le Con- 

grés ait lieu a Tunis. II lui plairait, 
au contraire, que le Congrés tienne 
ses assises, soit 4 Lyon, a Marseille, 

a Bordeaux ou a Toulouse, ou dans 

toute autre grande ville, voire a 

Paris.” 

Our readers will thus see that the 
French Government’ after deep 
thought will “certainly not consent 
that the Congress should be held in 
Tunis but prefers that it should be 
held in a French city, as, for example, 


27 


Baki asi Bi RS i Sanne ina ii wntenaitca 


sy i ap a rs Spi ca aia + ct Ro daar 


Marseilles, Bordeaux or 


at Lyons, 
Toulouse or even in Paris.” 

In other words, the French Gov- 
ernment does not want American Ne- 
groes prowling around its colonies and 


learning things. It would prefer to 
have them where it could watch them 
under the aegis trusted officials. Selah! 
What stronger argument is there for 
pushing the Pan-African idea? 
THE ELECTIONS 

HE results of the November elec- 

tion are encouraging for colored 
people. First of all, came the crash 
of the hopes of “Lily-white” Repub- 
licans in the South. They were fore- 
doomed to failure. They won through 
an appeal to religious fanaticism, pro- 
vincial narrowness and race hatred. 
No democracy can be built on such a 
basis. The political salvation of the 
South depends upon a democracy wide 
enough to include intelligent people of 
all races and colors. Neither the 
gambling Bishop, bourbons like Sim- 
mons, fools like Heflin, nor slick poli- 
ticians like Slemp, can ever lead such 
a movement. They and the Hoover- 
crats went down to defeat, not be- 
cause the President started to clean 
the Angean stables of Southern poli- 
tics, but because of color astigmatism 
in carrying his plans out. 

In addition to that, came a series 
of extraordinary victories which were 
not simply the victories of colored per- 
sons. We are at times compelled to 
vote for colored candidates simply be- 
cause they are colored, and the com- 
pulsion consists in the ignorance, en- 
mity or indifference of white candi- 
dates for the same office. But in this 
election, in a heartening number of 
cases, the colored candidates were the 
best candidates in the field by every 
measurement. In New York City, the 
Citizens’ Union indorsed and recom- 
mended Aldermen like Hawkins and 
Moore and members of the Legisla- 
ture like Rivers and Perkins. Even 
when Delaney was defeated by the ob- 


scure son of a third-rate white poli- . 


tician, the real citizens of New York, 
from the President of Columbia Uni- 
versity down, knew that Delaney was 
far and away the better man. In 
Cleveland, an intelligent and well- 
equiped colored woman gained a de- 
served place on the Board of Educa- 
tion, and _ elsewhere, ability and 
character triumphed, even with the 
American handicap of a dark skin. 
Herein lies splendid hope for the fu- 
ture. 


ABOUT MARRYING 
EAR MR. DU BOIS: 


I imagine in all appeals for your 
advice you rarely are called upon to 
aid Cupid, and certainly still more 


28 


rarely for such a case as mine. Briefly, 
I am a white young man and am in 
love with a colored girl. 


Now to give some details so you 
can better understand the situation. 
I graduated from in 
1924 and she from in 1923. 
Since then she has taught in various 
colored schools and I have been here 
most of the time teaching music, tak- 
ing some college work and occasionally 
doing music study in I now 
am 25 and she is 27. 


My parents are friendly to Negroes 
and in we associated with them 
to quite an extent. Because I inherited 
no racial prejudice I presume is one 
main factor in my “falling in love” 
with a colored girl. The first time I 
remember seeing her was in her high 
school Latin class when she was a 
Senior. I had a passing impression 
that she was the most beautiful girl I 
had ever seen. She comes from one 
of the better colored families, of 
course, and is a light mulatto—too 
dark though to pass as white and I am 
of German-English descent with sandy 
red hair and could never pass for col- 
ored. So. The next time I remem- 
ber her especially was at high school 
commencement when she took a $20 
gold piece prize in English and was 
one of the honor students. I did not 
meet her until three years later when 
she was a junior in college—she 19 
and I, 17. It was at her brother-in- 
law’s home, with whom I was chum- 
ming at the time. Then the deed was 
done and I passed two or three of the 
happiest weeks of my life. This was 
around Christmas time and when I 
went home for the holidays the wrath 
fell in earnest—they had warnings of 
it before. With all my parents’ broad- 
mindedness they, of course, drew the 
line at this not only because of race 
but religious reasons. I was brought 
up with conservative ideas on religion 
and to honor and obey my parents. 
Then began the struggle between 
obedience to my parents and my own 
desires. This struggle still continues. 
Of course, all our friends, colored and 
white, had their say—even the college 
and conservatory deans. They had no 
objections usually to her as a person 
but only because of racial difference. 


Our interests are common—music 
and French. It is now six years since 
I have seen her but we have corre- 
sponded most of the time. I still love 
her as intensely as at first. I am sure 
she was in love with me too but, you 
probably know and feel more keenly 
than I just what the but means. Some 
people think from some gossip passed 
on to me that our relations were im- 
moral. That is not so. As I said, I 
am conservative and my ideas of love, 


marriage and divorce and religion by 
the modern flaming youth would be 
considered hopelessly mid-Victorian, 
Puritanical, old fogey and all the 
other scornful terms applied to such. 
I do not smoke, drink, dance, play 
cards, rarely go to a movie and my 
relations with her were just as “nar- 
row”. Of course, since I do none of 
the above I never have a good time! 
Singing Beethoven’s ninth symphony 
under Dr. at , playing a 
Chopin and Mendelssohn concerto 
with orchestra, listening to the club 
give the “Messiah”, playing the “Mes- 
siah” and “Elijah” for the chorus here, 
listening to Roland Hayes, speaking 
French, and studying with the most 
noted Composition teacher in 
does not come under the category of 
“good time’’! 


But that is all beside the point. The 
point is I still am madly in love with 
her and want her to be with me to 
share all these good things, yes, and 
be the mother of my children. 

I do not advocate racial inter-mar- 
riage in general. But, Mr. Du Bois, 
since she is more white than Negro 
why should she not marry white? It’s 
just as logical that way as the other. 
I think the standard of husband-wife 
relationship should be made _princi- 
pally on a spiritual and _ intellectual 
basis. We have had intellectual fel- 
lowship as I have said. She is more 
liberal in her social and religious views, 
but I think we agree on the funda- 
mental—the God-Christ as atonement 
for sin. She is neat and attractive in 
her personal habits as I am. It is only 
the but that hinders. 


I want your view on inter-marriage 
and advice as to whether you think 
I should persuade her to marry me. 
I feel we could manage somehow. 
Our friends and relatives would have 
to accept us willy-nilly. And any- 
how we would not be marrying prin- 
cipally each other’s relatives. A great 
majority of mother’s folks I have not 
seen for twenty years and they mean 
nothing special to me. It’s her I want. 

We would have our own social con- 
tacts to make as any newly married 
couple does with its own peculiar 
problems. 











I have nearly written you several 
times for three or four years but never 
could get to the point of doing so. I 
presume I will act like a dear friend 
of father and mother’s whom I have 
heard them speak of very often when 
she asked for advice would say: “Now 
I want to know what you all think, 
but I will go ahead and do as I please 
afterwards.” 


P.S.° Can you recommend any book 
on the subject that will be helpful ?

My pear Mr. 





[ have your letter of September 
23rd. My advice is that if you wish 
to marry the girl and she wishes to 
marry you, then get married. 

I assume that both of you know ex- 
actly the kind of difficulties you are 
going to meet. I need hardly to re- 
hearse them. You are going to have 
restricted social intercourse, naturally 
se far as the whites are concerned; 
but also, so far as the colored people 
are concerned. In this matter, they 
are just as prejudiced as the whites. 
You are going to meet more or less in- 
sult and embarrassment in _ public 
places, if your wife is dark enough to 
have her color noticeable; and finally, 
(perhaps this is the most serious), you 
are going to have difficulty in finding 
work or in keeping it if people know 
that you have married a colored wo- 
man. It will be practically impossi- 
ble for you to find work in any college, 
white or colored. 

These are all facts which vou have 
got to face frankly. If, before you 
had fallen in love you had consulted 
me as to the possibility, I should have 
pointed out these facts and emphasized 
them and advised you to go no further. 
But now the question simply is, are 
both of you ready, in the face of this 
situation, to face a world “well lost 
for love”? 

I know of no book which treats this 
matter sanely to any extent. Halde- 
man-Julius has just published a little 
Blue Book by Schuyler which takes up 
the subject. I have also treated it 
briefly in my book “Darkwater”’. 

W. E. B. Du Bots. 


And now, Reader—white, black, 
green or yellow, what do you say in 
answer to this letter? Answer and we 
will publish a few of the letters. 


GAMBLING 


S compared with crap-shooting, 
always supposed to be the pecu- 
liar diversion of Negroes, nine-tenths 
of the operations of the Wall Street 
Stock Exchange favors craps, by every 
consideration of morals and social wel- 
fare. Unless the dice are loaded, crap- 
shooting is a game of pure chance, and 
the utmost that can happen is the 
transfer of actual wealth from one 
gambler to another. But in Wall 
Street, we have something much more 
complicated and much less defensible. 
We have a great gambling pool, 
forming nine-tenths of a set of opera- 
tions, of which the remaining tenth is 
legitimate and under present condi- 
tions necessary effort to sell capital to 
the highest bidder. 
If the government owned all capital 
and distributed it by science, reason 


January, 1930 





and welfare, as both Russia and Presi- 
dent Hoover are now attempting to do, 
stock gambling would cease. 

Around this, at present necessary 
operation, has arisen the habit of open 
betting on the future profit of the vari- 
ous industries seeking capital. Some of 
this betting takes the form of buying 
stock with the object of selling it for 
a higher price. There is an element of 
gambling here but it is the necessary 
gambling of privately owned capital 
and is as legitimate as crap-shooting. 

Beyond this, however, there is a 
custom so wide-spread that it involved, 
during 1928, as high as seven billion 
dollars of borrowed funds in addition 
30 or more billions of owned 
wealth. This consists of betting on 
the price of stock without buying it 
and with only the deposit of enough 
actual funds to insure the head gam- 
bler from sudden loss. It is this deal- 
ing in “futures”, that has set the 
United States crazy for the last few 
years, taking funds from legitimate in- 
dustry, depleting thrift accounts and 
stealing the wages of millions of peo- 
ple; it has made an astonishing num- 
ber of level-headed Americans dream 
that they were going to gamble them- 
selves into a financial heaven, where 
they would subsist on honey and illegal 
wine, and would sing, dance and do 
no work forever and forever. 

Moreover, the dice in this gambling 
are nearly always loaded. Everybody 
who knew anything knew that they 
were loaded. The head gamblers 
know the present value of stocks and 
the reasonable future values. They 
deliberately deceive their clients by 
subtle propaganda to pay unreasonable 
prices. The President of the United 
States, the Secretary of the Treasury, 
the heads of great industries, the lead- 
ers of social welfare, all knew that 
stock prices were unreasonably high, 
yet, for the most part, they were dumb 
until the crash came. They knew that 
prices were being paid for part-owner- 
ship in industrial enterprises, which 
were far beyond anything which the 
enterprise could ever legitimately earn, 
and yet, they were silent. They lis- 
tened in silence to a shameless propa- 
ganda that explained how a Miracle 
was happening and that miracle was 
involved in American financial leader- 
ship of the world; that in some magic 
way values were going to be re-cast 
so as to make Steel Common worth 
two or three times what it was really 
worth by any sane measurement. 

Every professional gambler in Wall 
Street, backed by the money distribut- 
ing power of the Federal Banking 
System, assured the world that this 
was so, with the idea of making profit 
by the gullability of ignorant investors. 
Every person of ordinary wisdom knew 


that the crash must come because the 
market had gone out beyond the steady- 
ing influence of real values and de- 
pending solely on gamblers’ lies and 
the gullability of morons. 

Just as there were gamblers who 
were gambling for a rise, and lied to 
make it, so there were other gamblers 
who, as the crest approached, gambled 
for a fall, and did not spare the truth 
to bring it about. The result was a 
crash so stupendous that it shook the 
world. 

What was that crash in its essence? 
If it had been merely the transfer of 
money from gambler to gambler, it 
would have resembled a huge crap 
game and have been negligible save in 
its moral results. There would have 
been the same amount of wealth and 
work as before and the same number 
of idle blood-suckers. This is what 
the New York Times assured us was 
true after the crash, while President 
Hoover and Secretary Mellon joined 
in similar statements. 

But these were half-truths. For 
the stock crash was far more than a 
transfer of hard-earned wealth and 
thrifty savings from poor people to the 
gambling rich. It involved destruction 
of wealth, work and _faith—these 
three and the greatest of these is the 
Faith, called Credit. We count as 
wealth today in organized industry not 
only what we have but what we ex- 
pect to have; not only what we do but 
what we plan todo. Destroy plans and 
overthrow legitimate expectation and 
industry is sick or dies. Of the great 
structure of modern time production 
and space distribution, the actual pres- 
ent goods, the pittance of cash money 
and the current days work are baga- 
telles compared with the expected 
value of goods to be finished, the value 
which goods now Here will have when 
they are There. Destroy the faith 
built on present Work—the Credit 
reared on present Cash and Goods and 
you have destroyed wealth and more 
than wealth. 

That is the reason the President 
and Cabinet and millionaires are rush- 
ing about and crying all is well when 
no one knows better than they that 
all is not well because gamblers have 
been squandering the nation’s wealth 
which industry needed and expected. 

The collapse of the Stock Market 
was not only loss of capital taken from 
legitimate industry and sunk and de- 
stroyed in wild-cat schemes; it was 
above all, a shaking of the faith of 
Americans in American industrial 
organization and in _ all private 
capitalistic enterprise. It was the 
most tremendous blow to the _in- 
tegrity and efficiency of the capitalistic 
and privately-owned industry of Amer- 
ica which that organization ever re- 


29 


ceived. American capitalism was 
stabbed in the house of its friends. 
Nothing that Socialists have said or 
thought for one hundred years has so 
openly and crassly pointed out the 
weakness and injustice of industrial 
life in America. 

The end is not yet. The President 
may repudiate all his individualism 
and deny the laissez-faire of private 
enterprise by hurriedly summoning the 
captains of industry and pleading with 
them for that co-operation, scientific 
foresight and submergence of the profit 
motive which only an efficient State can 
supply in fullest measure. The funda- 
mental weakness of our system still 
remains. We are gambling with 
loaded dice. If gamble we must, we 
would far better confine ourselves to 
craps. 


FOOTBALL 


HE right of a football coach to 

bench a player is granted. But the 
reason must be the good of the team. 
The benching of one of the best play- 
ers on the New York University team 
in a game with Georgia students, was 
indefensible because it was a despicable 
vielding to sheer race prejudice. The 
student body resented it. They were 
ready to refuse to attend the game. 
The city resented it. The N. A, A. 
C. P. stood ready with help and co- 
operation. A group of colored Harlem 
men were ready to pay this black boy 
for what he would lose by resenting 
the insult. The only person who had 
no complaint was the black player 
himself. He refused in any way to 
communicate with the officials of the 
N. A. A. C. P. The reason given 
for his failure to play was an alleged 
injury, which proved, in fact, to be 
nothing serious, and finally he went 
back and played out the season. We 
have much sympathy for the struggle 
of the younger Negro between the 
prejudice of whites and the selfish con- 
servatism of blacks, but for this colored 
football player, we have nothing but 
contempt. 

DISSENT 

READ Tue Crisis with interest 

and admiration, but every now and 
then I come across something which 
jars unnecessarily. For example, in 
the December number, presumably the 
peace and good-will number, on page 
404, there is a deserving and glowingly 
eloquent tribute to Moorfield Storey 
utterly spoiled by the violence of the 
phrase, “this Hell of America.” 

In the first place, the phrase is not 
justified unless you despair entirely of 
mankind. I have lived in many coun- 
tries and have been in four continents, 
and comparing America with other 
countries, it stands out far above most 


30 


of them in its human relations. If 
then America is a hell, most of the 
other countries of the world must be 
the lowest depths of hell. To this 
drastic doctrine I am sure you will not 
assent. 

Or, by concentrating one’s attention 
on the ugliest aspects of American life, 
grant for a moment that the phrase is 
justified—it is still not expedient. 
The battle for human justice will be 
won not by vituperation, but by those 
qualities which you rightly extol in 
Moorfield Storey, — gentlemanliness, 
aristocratic dignity and courtesy. It 
injures, not helps, the cause to which 
Mr. Storey devoted himself, to give 
way to temper. 

D. pe Sota Poot, New York. 


THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE 

HERE is only one item of specific 

interest to American Negroes 
in the recent Message of the President 
of the United States. They are, of 
course, with all Americans  over- 
whelmed by the thought that $700,- 
000,000 is being spent by the army of 
the nation which leads in the advocacy 
of peace, and that during the next six 
years over a thousand millions may 
go for battleships. There is, too, the 
following paragraph: 

The test of the rightfulness of our 
decisions must be whether we have sus- 
tained and advanced the ideals of the 
American people; self-government in its 
foundations of local government; jus- 
tice whether to the individual or to the 
group; ordered liberty; freedom from

But no black man assumes that the 
President had any thought of colored 
folk when he wrote this. The fol- 
lowing words do, however, touch us 
directly: 

We still have marines on foreign soil 
—in Nicaragua, Haiti and China. In 
the large sense we do not wish to be 
represented abroad in such manner. ... 
In Haiti we have about 700 marines, 
but it is a much more difficult problem, 
the solution of which is still obscure.

commission to Haiti to review and study 
the matter in an endeavor to arrive at 
some more definite policy than at pres-

Herbert H. Lehman, Lieutenant Gov- 
ernor of the State of New York, has 
been elected by the Board of Directors 
to fill the place made vacant by the 
death of Louis Marshall. Mr. Lehman 
comes to the Association with the pres- 
tige not alone of public service in one 
of the highest offices of honor which his 
state has to offer. He served his coun- 
try during the World War, being pro- 
moted through successive grades to the 
rank of Colonel. Besides this, his name 
is known in the world of finance, and 
industry, as that of one of the ablest of 
leaders. The banking firm which bears 
his name is respected as one against 
which no word of reproach has been 
uttered. 

The accession of such a powerful 
force, testifies to the vitality of the idea 
which goes marching on though its 
champions pass. So does the addition 
to the National Legal Committee of 
Professor Felix Frankfurter, of the 
Harvard School of Law. When lib- 
eral causes in the United States have 
cried out for able and courageous de- 
fenders, often the name of Professor 
Frankfurter has been among the first 
to be called. He has not hesitated to 
stand against public clamor, mob pres- 
sure, even against the subtler and more 
powerful pressure exerted by the dom- 
inating forces in American social, politi- 
cal and financial life. His record in 
the Sacco-Vanzetti cases remains one of 
the bright spots in an episode dark with 
many kinds of shame. 

To have a legal mind and a per- 
sonality of the calibre of Professor 
Frankfurter, among the consultants 
and advisers of the N. A. A. C. P. in 
its legal problems, is occasion for 
hearty congratulations. 

Still another accession to the Associa- 
tion’s forces, it is a pleasure to record. 
It is that of James Marshall, Louis 
Marshall’s son. James Marshall, too, 
has joined the Association’s National 
Legal Committee. His carrying on the 
work that was so close to his father’s 
heart, retains on the Association’s rec- 
ords a name that will always be hon- 
ored in its history. 

It remains to mention. one whose 
name is well known to colored Amer- 
icans. It is T. G. Nutter, former mem- 
ber of the legislature of West Virginia, 





prominent attorney in Charleston, 
West Virginia, and president of the 
N. A. A. C. P. Branch in that city. 
Mr. Nutter has won vital and pioneer- 
ing cases for the rights of colored peo- 
ple in his state. He fought to a finish 
and won their right to use the Public 
Library in West Virginia’s capital city. 
More recently still, he won:a residen- 
tial segregation case, one of the first 
and most decisive victories ever won 
against the principle of segregation by 
covenant among property owners. Now 
Mr. Nutter has been added to the law- 
yers who comprise the Association’s 
National Legal Committee. To this 
council, in whose hands lie decisions 
affecting millions of United States citi- 
zens, now and in years to come, Mr. 
Nutter comes as a valued addition. 

So, although champions pass, new 
champions step forward. And it is this 
continuity of the idea of the N. A. A. 
C. P. which seems almost to defeat 
death itself. So fortified, the Associa- 
tion may look with confidence toward 
the triumphs of the future. 


MRS. DAISY LAMPKIN 
HE success of the N. A. A. C. P. 


has been due in large measure to 
the untiring work of colored women. 
Some of their names are enrolled in its 
records. The late Mrs. Talbert was a 
holder of that coveted distinction, the 
Spingarn Medal. To Mrs. Memphis 
T. Garrison, of Gary, West Virginia, 
who originated and now administers 
the distribution of N. A. A. C. P. 
Christmas seals, went the Mme. C. J. 
Walker Medal last year. The names 
of colored women who have been lead- 
ers in their communities, who have 
kept the N. A. A. C. P. work alive, 
are too numerous to mention. 

It is an exceptional pleasure to re- 
cord that one such woman has recently 
been added to the National Staff, as 
regional field secretary. The name of 
Mrs. Daisy Lampkin will be known 
wherever colored women meet to- 
gether. Her achievements have been so 
unusual that they have long been the 
subject of public knowledge and com- 
ment. 

In Pittsburgh, Mrs. Lampkin’s 
home, she obtained very nearly 2,000 
members for the local branch of the 
N. A. A. C. P., making it one of the 
strong branches of the Association. 
During the war she had charge among

she added 15,000 members to that body

do so much, but not for Mrs. Lamp-

inspiring other people with some of her 
own energy and enthusiasm. The Asso-

among colored women are playing in

And the treatment to which they 
will be subjected while in prison may 
be readily pictured. 

Advices upon events subsequent to 
the above described trial state that M. 
Carl Brouard another journalist and a 
representative of an aristocratic Hai- 
tian family has been imprisoned for 
having protested against the consecra- 
tion of two French priests as Bishops 
respectively of Gonaives and Port-de- 
Pain. 

His protest charged that these ap- 
pointments were clearly contrary to the 
law and that the High Clergy being 
white maintains and fosters racial 
prejudice against the Haitian priests 
who have been systematically denied 
elevation to the Bishopric. All these 
editors conclude in summarizing the 
policy of Borno as the policy of a 
traitor to this country. 

This is the crime of Jacques Rou- 
main, George Petit, Guerin and more 
¢ecently of Carl Brouard.

The various chapters of the book 
have appeared in the Revue des Deux 
Mondes and the Revue de Paris from 
1920 to 1929. The first chapter is 
called the Black Belt of Chicago 
(1920); it tells of the riots which 
took place at that time and analyses 
with penetration the cause of those 
disturbances. It is followed by a de- 
scription of the Republican Conven- 
tion at Chicago in 1920, dealing with 
the electoral publicity connected with 
the convention, the crowd, the candi- 
dates and the triumph of women in the 
campaign. 


In Harlem (New York): the 
Negro “Renaissance” is a study of the 
situation of Negroes after the war, 
the industrialization of the Southern 
states, the urbanization of Negroes, 
Harlem, the capital of the black race, 
“towards a black middle class”, the 
black press, the Negro horizon, Afri- 
can preoccupations and opinions about 
the future. Mr. Schoell tells us that 
in 1922 he spoke of a “sudden out- 
burst of black solidarity”. “That 
stage is already past,” he says, “for 
history makes great strides in the 
twentieth century. One can now 
speak of a development of that solid- 
arity, noting, however, that we have 
been led by the forces of things to con- 
sider above all the Negroes who have 
evolved and that the mass follows with 
some delay. Mr. Schoell admits that 
“this great phenomenon which we have 
noticed, that pride of race which has 
almost become a psychosis of race is a 
good thing from many angles. By the 
fact that more and more Negroes as- 
pire to be self-sufficient, to make their 
purchases at a Negro grocer’s, to be- 
come members of a Negro mutual ben- 
efit society, to read black magazines, 
to be buried by black clergymen; they 
create a livelihood for black business- 
men, journalists, clergymen, they as- 
sure a virtual monopoly for those of 
their race and contribute to constitut- 
ing a sort of half bourgeois middle- 
class, an intellectual proletariat in 
some respects, which tends to take the 
mass along with it over ways of a 
certain progress.” But the author is 
afraid that the nationalism or chau- 
vinism, as he calls it, if pushed to its 
extreme consequences, would entail 
many dangers for the future of the 
black race and that the militant atti- 
tude of sufficiency which the race seems 
to want to adopt more and more in 
the United States would have the effect 
of retarding the normal development 
of the race, by artificially stimulating 
the creation of separate enterprises and 
institutions and by fixing attention of 
each one on inferior models.

EAST AFRICA 

@ The Kikuyu Central Association, 
composed of the younger natives, has 
protested against the report of Sir 
Samuel Wilson, recommending. that 
native interests in the Kenya East 
Africa Legislature should be repre- 
sented by whites. The Association de- 
mands that there be at least three Afri- 
cans in the Kenya legislature. It also 
protested against the omission of Eng- 
lish in the native elementary schools, 
@ The Aborigines Protection Society 
has petitioned the new English Secre- 
tary of State for the Colonies to estab- 
lish in East Africa a common citizen- 
ship for civilized British subjects re- 
gardless of color; a common test of 
civilization and legislation without 
racial distinction; it protests forced 
labor, and asks for taxation in pro- 
portion to wealth, and adequate land 
for the natives. 


@ December 16 is known as Din- 


gaan’s Day in South Africa, in mem- 


ory of Dingaan, who led the natives 
against the English and Boors nearly 
a hundred years ago. 


Black Rulers 
(Continued from page 16) 


born in Kentucky in 1889, the young- 
est of ten children. His father, a Civil 
War Veteran, died when he was nine 
years old. His mother moved to Kan- 
sas, where the boy was educated and 
went into business. Finally, he studied 
theology and pastored Congregational 
churches in Memphis and Athens. He 
came to Cleveland in 1925. In 1929, 
he was elected to fill the unexpired 
term of Thomas W. Fleming, and was 
reelected this fall. 

It will thus be seen that the legend 
that Negroes are entirely without poli- 
tical rights and that they never rule 
over white folk as well as black 1 
quite untrue. On the other hand, i 
is only too true that of the perhaps 
seven million colored people who live 
in the far South, there is not 4 
single member of the Legislature; 4 
sing gle judicial officer, or a single mem 
ber of a City Council. In fact, it is 
only in rare cases that one can find 4 
colored Notary Public.
