UNDERSTANDING,

ae. and 
i CO-OPERATION 


Students of Negro Progress in America differ as to the line of 
endeavor in which we have made the greatest headway. Some say 
in education, culture, health, finance, religion, etc. We, in the busi- 
ness world, contend that Negroes have shown their highest develop- 
ment in sympathetic understanding and sincere appreciation of each 
other’s problems and accomplishments under great handicaps, and in a 
warm spirit of co-operation. 


The Southern Aid Society of Virginia, Inc., protects the lives and 
well-being of its policyholders. Claims paid to policyholders help to 
support physicians, nurses, merchants, druggists, landlords, etc. Funds 
of the company are deposited in banks and these funds are loaned to 
home buyers, business and professional, as well as other people. The 
Society employs an army of young women and men. These activities 
help to lift all classes of our people to a higher plane in the scale of civi- 
lization. This powerful Race Lever is known and appreciated every- 
where. Here is an example:

Gentlemen : 


A question was put to me some days ago, asking what I thought of the Southern Aid 
Society. Without hesitating, I answered: Aside from the sentimental rezson, which of course 
could not be discounted, from a commercial standpoint its services are invaluable, for it serves 
to take care of the wage-earners in distress and helps to put them on their feet, and it gives 
employment to a large number of men and women. These I could learn from observation 
and actual contact. 

I hope you will write more insurance, give more service, and thereby give more employ- 
ment. 

Yours truly

HEN they say that a man or a 
woman 


Has been awarded a medal, 

What does that mean? 

It means that he has done his best in 
some fine way 

And that his best has been very good. 

One sings, one paints, one plays upon 
soft strings, 

Which is to say, one looks inward 
upon beauty, 

Sees beauty a little clearer than his 
neighbors, 

Sees color and line, hears harmony and 
tone 

More vividly than you or I| see and 
DORT.. «4 : 

So then we give him a medal, 

A golden medal. 

Then we all say to him: “Oh, we too 
have seen beauty, 

Mountains, seas, roses, moons and 
meadows, 

Flow of light, flight of wings, surge 
of water, 

We too have seen and loved, but you 
have seen better than we, 

You have taught us to see better, 

And so we give you a medal, 

A golden medal”. 

Another has a vision of law, of heal- 
ing, of transportation, 

Of building, of forestry, of hospital- 
ity; 

And to him we say: “You have 
shown us what might be, 

What medicine and travel and con- 


struction and forests and inns - 


Might be to the people. 

You teach us to look a little deeper 
into life, 

To discern that our daily routine, your 
routihe, my routine 

Ties us unto the infinite., 

And so, behold, we give you medals.” 


N°“ today one comes who has 
idealized business, 

Who into buying and selling 

And into providing people with the 
needful 

Has put something of the vision of 
creative art, 

Something of the honesty of human 
relationship, 

And brilliant social common sense. 

And we here are rejoicing 

That the energy and vitality of a 
dream 

Have become the energy and vitality 
of this man’s experience 

And so of our own experience. 

But is this all? Are there no more 
medals?

Are there not medals to be given for 
other things? 


Of this race to only one of whom there 
is given today 

A medal for conspicuous service, 

Hundreds, thousands are giving hid- 
den service 

Whom we would cover with medals, 
if we could. 

Not only, not only are medals due to 
those who rise 

In art, in industry, in the humanities, 

But’also to those who in countless ways 
feed and conserve life 

In kitchen, in Pullman car, in office, 
in shop, in school, in college; 

Who patiently, bit by bit, lay the 
foundation 

For some tomorrow of all races. 

Not you and not I know when that 
tomorrow shall be; 

Or how it shall come,

When all races shall stand on their 
planet 

Under their sky and lit by their sun 

And shall say to one another: 

“Not your race and not my race 

But our race is in charge of this 
world.” 

Yet this we do know: 

That not a day of life passes over our 
heads 

‘That we do not further or hinder that 
coming day. 

And that every time, by word or look, 

One hastens that day, 

He is already truly a member of that 
common race. 


OW I tell you the act which of 
all acts 

Seems to me to be needed 

For bringing in that day of right re- 
lationship: 

Friends, every time that any member 

Of the red, the black, the yellow or 
the brown race 

Can find it in his heart to teach to 
others 

The sheer absurdity 

Of the arrogance of the white race to- 
ward him, 

Why, then, just so far he has helped 

to teach to the white race 

Our common ownership of the earth, 

The common fatherhood of .God, 

The common brotherhood of man. 

And just so far, whether it knows it 
or not, 

The white race is gloriously in his 
debt. 

How shall he do that? 

How shall he teach the white race its 
place? 

Not by bitterness—bitterness never has 
accomplished anything. 

Not by reprisals—these too are use- 
less. 

Not by arrogance—black arrogance is 
no better than white arrogance. 

How then? 

I think of this: Last Sunday afternoon 

There in that vast hall, 

When, by the speakers, one and an- 
other and another instance was 
given 

Of the sad failure of the dominant 
race 

To grasp its opportunities, 

Did you not hear the wholesome, tofer- 
ant laughter? 

Laughter that swept the audience like 
a wind?

“Excluded from travel save as por-

Three Achievements and Their Significance 


E came together this year in 
this Eighteenth Annual Con- 
ference after a year of what 

we might call a year of triumph, a 
year of victory. At our opening ses- 
sion on last Wednesday morning I 
rehearsed briefly to our delegates a 
general summary of the direction and 
of the processes which this organiza- 
tion has followed since its foundation. 
This organization began as an organi- 
zation almost exclusively of agitation. 
When the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People 
was founded, when it was organized, 
the fundamental citizenship rights of 
the Negro and the estimation in which 
the Negro was held by the general 
American public had reached the low- 
est point possible. In fact, America 
in general was not concerned about the 
Negro in America as a man and a citi- 
zen. It was concerned about him, per- 
haps, as a factor in labor or in politics, 
a negative factor, but was not very 
much interested in him otherwise. So 
the first job of this organization was 
the awakening, a quickening, a prick- 
ing, of the American conscience, of 
public opinion and we began with the 
only weapon which we had at hand and 


that weapon was intelligent and per- 
sistent agitation about the right and 
the wrong. We began to agitate about 
what was at that time and still is in a 
very large measure the great American 
crime, the great American disgrace and 


in some states the great 
American pastime—lynching. 
And we brought the cruel, 
naked, raw savage facts 
about lynching and began 
placing them before the 
American public and before 
the civilized and the un- 
civilized world. The un- 
civilized world included a 
very large section of the 
American people themselves. 

This organization has al- 
ways sought to use the weap- 
ons which were most effec- 
tive and which were possible 
for us. When we first 
started the most effective 
weapon that we had, the 
most available weapon, was 
intelligent agitation and we 
used it. Now we have gone 
on further; we do not de- 
pend entirely upon agitation. 
The greatest victories of the 
organization during the past 
twelve months have been 
victories in the courts of 
America, from the lowest to 
the highest. Yet we still agi-

a md: 


tate and for some of the conditions, for 
some of the situations which confront 
colored people in America, agitation is 
still the most effective weapon that can 
be used. 

THE AIKEN LYNCHING 

HE latest effective piece of agita- 

tion which we have been able to 
launch was against lynching. "We have 
been fighting lynching for a generation 
but we still have to fight it and we agi- 
tated against the Lowman lynching at 
Aiken, South Carolina. South Caro- 
lina, known as one of the proud states 
of the South, the home of Southern 
aristocracy. Aiken, the winter resort 
of Northern aristocracy. Yet it was 
in this old state and in this select com- 
munity in this state that within these 
recent months occurred an_ incident 
which should cause every American to 
hang his head in shame. Three 
humble Negroes accused of a crime, 
accused of murder, hastily tried, 
tarcically tried, convicted and con- 
demned; a few days still await- 
ing them when their cases were 
taken up by a colored lawyer of South 


Carolina, Mr. N. J. Frederick. Mr. 


Frederick appealed these cases to the 
Supreme Court of South Carolina 
and to the credit of that court and to 
the state, the cases were remanded to 
the Circuit Court for trial. And s0, 
in the re-trial Mr. Frederick, assisted 
by a Southern white lawyer, Mr. L. G. 
Southard, represented the Lowmans. 
These three Negroes, two of them men 
and one a woman, were being re-tried 
in the courts of South Carolina and in 
the course of the trial, upon motion of 
Mr. Frederick, the Judge directed a 
verdict of not guilty for one of the 
defendants and it is most probable that 
the other two would have been acquit- 
ted. But what happened? On that 
night a mob gathered and entered the 
jail through the connivance of the of- 
ficers of the law and those two men 
and that woman were taken out and 
shot to death. 


OW, the National Association for 

the Advancement of Colored 
People did play a great part in focus- 
ing the attention of the American 
people upon this lynching. It is most 
likely that the Aiken lynching would 
have passed as an ordinary piece of 
news, not even law-abiding Americans 
being in any way shocked or disturbed 
about it. But the National Office of 
the N. A. A. C. P. sent Walter, White 
to Aiken. He went there and I need 
not tell you that it was no matter of 
play for him to do it. He went there 
and as a result of his visit he secured

the names of a score or more of the 
men who had taken part in his mob and 
those names were placed in the hands 
of the Governor of South Carolina. 
Following Mr. White’s investigation 
the New York World sent one of its 
star correspondents to the scene and 
the whole Aiken disgrace was upon the 
front pages of the New York World 
and other great Northern newspapers 
as well as the newspapers of the South, 
especiady the newspapers of South 
Carolina. 

We could not save the Lowmans 
and we have not been able to indict or 
punish their murderers, their foul and 
cowardly murderers, but at least we 
have made the decent citizens of South 
Carolina aware of the shame and the 
degradation of their state and we have 
no doubt made it easier for law-abid- 
ing citizens in South Carolina to stand 
up for common justice and common de- 
cency than it would have been with- 
out the assistance of this organization. 


HAT was a piece of agitation ; and 

may I stop here long enough to 
say that I want you to get a compre- 
hension of the fight against lynching 
which this organization makes. Does 
anyone for a moment suppose that it 
is merely to save a few miserable Negro 
wretches from the sufferings which 
they undergo at the hands of these 
savage barbarians? That, of course. 
But that is not all. What are we 
fighting for? Eventually everybody 
must die and some must die terrible 
deaths, but there is more behind it. 
This fight against lynching is not 
merely a fight to save a few men who 
are put to a swift death and a few 
women, too. The Negro—and the 
National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored. People—is fighting as 
much for the whole of America as for 
Negro America. In fact, this fight 
against lynching is merely an illustra- 
‘on of what this organization stands 
for in the whole idea of American 
democracy. Look at all the organiza- 
tions at work in America today and 
make an estimate of their work and 
what they are doing and you cannot 
find a single one that has higher ideals 
or ideals that are more vital to the 
happiness and the security of this coun- 
try than the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People. 
This organization has nothing to hide. 
It can declare its principles anywhere 
in America and they square up with 
everything that every decent American 
stands for. Compare it if you will 
with the Ku Klux Klan—the Ku Klux 
Klan subversive of everything that is 
in the Constitution and the Declara- 
tion of Independence, and the National 
Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People standing for every- 


September, 1927 


thing that is fundamental to a democ- 
racy. The ideals that the National 
Association stands for, the ideals that 
the Negro stands for—they are the 
ideals that are at the bottom of our 
democratic government. If the Na- 
tional Association fails, if the Negro 
fails in what he is fighting for, then 
American Democracy fails with him. 
And so, in this fight against lynching, 
it goes much further than the poor 
Lowmans and hundreds and hundreds 
of others that could be cited. 


AKE the case of lynching a few 

days ago in dark and benighted 
Mississippi. While in New York City 
millions of people were acclaiming 
Lindbergh who had made ’an achieve- 
ment which added to the glory of 
America, to its name throughout the 
whole world and which added to scien- 
tific effort and achievement, at that 
very hour when millions of Americans, 
not only white but black, in the city 
of New York were acclaiming Lind- 
bergh, a mob of a thousand or more 
barbarians in Mississippi had taken 
charge of two Negroes, brothers, ac- 
cused of killing a slave-driving over- 
seer in a sawmill. They took them 
from the hands of the constituted au- 
thorities and what did they do with 
them? ‘They chained them to a tele- 
graph pole, baptized them in gasoline 
and set them afire. 

Now, what do you think the fight 
against lynching means? Does it 
mean so much the mere saving of two 
solitary black men from being made 
into a bon fire, or does it mean saving 
the civilization of a whole state? I 
shall try and put it more graphically. 
Try to balance if you can the momen- 
tary sufferings of those two black men, 
their physical suffering, against the 
moral degradation, the degeneracy of 
the white people of that community. 
I have sometimes tried to put it this 
way, that after all the Negro problem, 
so far as it is involved in lynching, 
may mean this: the saving of black 
America’s body and of white America’s 
soul. That is why we are agitating 
about lynching and all the other griev- 
ances and outrages perpetrated against 
the American Negro. 


LOUISIANA SEGREGATION 
DECISION 


LL of the injustice against the 

Negro is not obvious, blatant, 
like lynching. After all, there are lots 
of Negroes in the United States who 
never have, up to this time, been 
lynched. But let me say to you that 
there is lynching of the spirit and of 
the soul as well as lynching of the 
body. For instance, take a great 
Southern city like -Atlanta, Georgia. 
In 1920 this Association held its annual 


conference in Atlanta. Some people 
thought that we would not do it. It 
was after the terrible summer of 1919 
when Negroes were mobbed and 
beaten to death in a dozen civilized 
American cities including the capital of 
the nation and our friends said: “Do 
not do it. Call your conference off. 
Cancel it.” We did not. We went 
to Atlanta. Going down, Mr. Arthur 
B. Spingarn and I were in the same 
seat riding in a Pullman car; which of 
course is a crime down there. We got 
out together and a red cap seized his 
bag and mine. I do not know whether 
Mr. Spingarn noticed it or not, but it 
was a psychological study to me to see 
through the back of that red cap’s 
head what was going on in his brain. 
Now, what was his great problem? 
What was the poor man trying to 
solve? It was whether to violate the 
law by taking Mr. Spingarn through 
the Jim Crow exit with me or by tak- 
ing me through the white folks’ exit 
with him. I say this to his credit: he 
finally resolved that if he had to 
go to jail he would go to jail for tak- 
ing me through the white exit and 
so he did. 


OW that sounds ridiculous. It 
sounds trifling and I have heard 
a number of our friends say: “Why 
worry about such trifling things?” But 
perhaps after all the absurdity of it is 
what makes it in some measure tragic. 
Here is a great city where Negroes and 
white folks live pretty close together, 
much closer than they do in lots of 
Northern cities; where they live on 
terms of intimacy; their food prepared, 
their babies nursed, their sick taken 
care of by black hands. Yet an en- 
trance to a great railroad station al- 
most as wide as this Tabernacle is too 
narrow for the two races to walk 
through together. An effort at sheer 
humiliation. An absurd effort at 
lynching the Negro’s spirit. Why 
should a white person who is not too. 
proud to eat biscuit mixed by black 
hands be afraid to walk through the 
same entrance of a railroad station? 
That is merely one of the absurd ef- 
forts—and sometimes quite successful 
in spite of the ridiculousness of it— 
to lynch the Negro’s spirit. 

A more serious effort of that same 
kind are the segregation laws. Here 
we have white households which for 
many hours of the day are tenanted by 
both white and black people and they 
want laws on the statute books saying 
that whites and blacks cannot live in 
the same block or in the same street or 
in the same section of the city. What 
is it? What is behind it? An effort 
at lynching the Negro’s spirit. 


ND so this Association has not 
only fought these outside mani- 


223 


a 






















































festations of this damnable thing but 
we fight that which is more insidious, 
the thing which is concealed and un- 
der all the rest. And we have fought 
these segregation ordinances wherever 
they have poked their heads up. Some- 
times that fight has had to be doubled. 
There have been cases in which we 
have had to fight the idea through the 
heads of Negroes themselves. I do 
not know what it is—I suppose it is 
some sort of a Freudian complex—I 
cannot explain it—I am not a psy- 
chologist—but Negroes sometimes get 
thrown back on themselves and it robs 
them of what they need in making a 
fight of this sort and they make use of 
this sort of defense and say: “We 
do not care; we want to be to our- 
selves. It makes no difference. We 
do not want any law which will allow 
us to live where the white folks live.” 
Of course we want to be with our- 
selves. That is very natural. It is 
very natural that colored people and 
various other groups, for reasons which 
need no explanation, love to be to- 
gether. People who speak the same 


language—I mean who have the same - 


ideas—find it easier to be together. 
They do not have to think. You can- 
not be lazy and lazy-minded and be a 
citizen of the world. The more lazy- 
minded we are the more we want to 
get right into the center of what we 
call our group. It takes no effort to 
live. You do not have to know very 
much. And so we have had to fight 
this thing first of all through the 
heads of many Negroes. We 
should love to be together. but 
this is a very different thing from 
having a law upon the statute books 
of the city or the state or the nation 
saying you have got to live together. I 
heard my friend Pickens put it the 
other day in his own inimitable way. 
He said: “I would not think of wear- 
ing a red hat now, but if they passed a 
law that colored men could not wear 
red hats, I would insist on having 
nothing but a red hat.” 

Now, we have fought segregation by 
enactment in this country. We have 
fought it and beaten it down so that 
it cannot ever appear again. We won 
the Louisville Segregation Case in 
1917. We reaffirmed it and strength- 
ened it in the New Orleans Segrega- 
tion Case and we drove a nail in its 
coffin and clinched it on the other side 
in the Indianapolis case. Segregation 
by law in the United States is dead and 
it is dead because the National Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People killed it. And, my friends, 
if we had not done it you may rest 
assured that there would have been 
segregation laws in every state and 
every city in the United States where 
there is any considerable colored popu- 
lation.

THE WHITE PRIMARY CASE 


OW I can come to the last achieve- 

ment which I shall mention. 
These three achievements dur- 
ing the past year will give you some 
idea of the purpose and also of the ef- 
fects and the results of the work this 
organization is doing. We now come 
to what has been the most far-reaching 
victory ever achieved by this organiza- 
tion and that is the decision of the 
United States Supreme Court in the 
Texas White Primary Case. The State 
of Texas had a law—and this law is 
very much like the laws of other South- 
ern states—and that law said that no 
Negro should vote in a Democratic 
primary. Now what does “Democratic 
primary” mean in Texas? “Democratic 
primary” means “white primary”. It 
therefore means that no Negro shall 
vote in a white primary, because there 
is no Republican primary. I could go 
into that and tell you why there are 
no Republican primaries, but that is 
another speech. What does a primary 
election amount to in Texas? It 
amounts to all the election there is or 
is to be. A primary election is an elec- 
tion intended for the selection of candi- 
dates. They have one primary, a sec- 
ond primary and sometimes even three 
primaries. Then they have the gen- 
eral election as understood by the -peo- 
ple at large. By the time they get to 
the general election in Texas every- 
body with any sense at all is tired of 
voting because they know the whole 
thing has been settled. So for colored 
citizens in Texas not to be able to vote 
in the primaries and content themselves 
with voting in the general election 
would be like rising to third or fourth 
a motion, having no effect whatever. 


UR Branch in El Paso, Texas, 

took up a case which is now his- 
tory. As soon as they took it up and 
took. the first steps, they got in touch 
with the National Office and we carried 
that case through the Federal courts of 
Texas on up to the Supreme Court of 
the United States and gained a unani- 
mous decision which declares laws of 
that kind to be unconstitutional. Let 
me just interpolate this: that in gain- 
ing that unanimous decision of the Su- 


preme Court we did more than merely’ 


kill that kind of legislation. The 
United States Supreme Court went on 
record as re-writing and re-afirming 
the Fourteenth Amendment in more 
emphatic language than was used by the 
Congress which originally passed it. I 
do not know whether you realize the 
importance of that. But if you are 
familiar at all with the history of the 
Fourteenth Amendment you will know 
that from the time of its passage on 
down the Supreme Court has been 
busy whittling it away, splitting it into 


shreds so thin and fine that the Four- 
teenth Amendment up to a few months 
ago meant actually nothing. 

There have been more than six hun- 
dred decisions rendered by the United 
States Supreme Court based on the 
Fourteenth Amendment, an amend- 
ment which was passed specifically for 
the protection of the newly enfran- 
chised Negro citizens and out of those 
more than six hundred decisions only 
about thirty have anything to do with 
the Negro at all and the majority of 
these are against him. And so the 
Supreme Court’s recent decision was 
more than to declare such primary laws 
unconstitutional. 


OW I must get away from that 

because I want to say a practical 
word about this victory. I want to 
ask what are we going to do about it. 
All of these victories that the National 
Association wins, if the Negroes of 
America do not themselves take ad- 
vantage of them, will be ineffective. 
For example, going back a moment to 
the segregation decision, the National 
Association by these victories has given 
the Negro a weapon by which he can 
kill any segregation law anywhere in 
the United States, but you have got 
to use that weapon. If in some city a 
city council, ignorant of the fact that 
there is a Supreme Court, should pass 
a segregation ordinance and colored 
citizens do not use the weapon which 
this Association has given them, we 
cannot help it. We have put the 
weapon into their hands. 


We have done something of the same 
kind in this White Primary Decision 
and we want to know if the Negroes 
of the United States and especially of 
the South are going to take advantage 
of it. You might justly ask: ‘Well, 
give us your opinion as to how we 
might take advantage of it.” I will 
cell you quite plainly. In every state 
where there are such primary laws on 
the Statute books now Negroes should 
register locally as Democrats and 
vote. (Applause). Now, that is 
very encouraging—to get that many 
hands on that statement. When 
I made that statement four years ago 
I got a few groans. Some of the 
brethren really moaned in spirit. I 
will tell you why you ought to do that. 
Because it is a Democratic primary. 
You cannot go in and vote in a Demo- 
cratic primary by declaring yourself to 
be a Republican or a _ Socialist. 
I am giving you just practical ad- 
vice what I. consider to be com- 
mon sense. But there is something 
back of it bigger and broader. I feel 
that the time has come for the Negro 
in the South to make himself a political 
factor locally and it is worth more than 
being a political (Turn to page 242)

Dramatis Personae: Mr. Greyson, 
Special Representative of President 
Harding. General Moncada, Com- 
mander of the victorious Liberal forces. 

Place: Field of Battle at Tipitapa, 
Moncada’s Camp. 

(Enter Greyson). 

Greyson. — (graciously) — Good 
morning, General Moncada. 

Moncada. — Good morning Sr. 
Greyson. 

Greyson—Hope you are well this 
morning, General. . 

Moncada.—O, not as well as you, 
Sr. Stimson. 

Greyson—You have certainly put 
up a good scrap, General,—Why al- 
most twenty battles and victorious in 
every one, from the Atlantic Coast to 
the very gates of Managua. I really 
must congratulate you. 

Moncada.—Indeed ? 

Greyson.—Why, think of Pearl 
Lagoon. The fortifications there were 
planned by our own boys. We even 
lent the conservatives some of our U. S. 
arms. We gave them provisions, tin 
goods, etc. from our own stock on 
board ship. When the Admiral threw 
away your ammunition at Rio Grande, 
he felt perfectly sure there would be no 
reports against him as it was practi- 
cally impossible for your forces to cap- 
ture such a position; and he believed 
that your army would be annihilated 
there. 

Moncada.—Is that so? 


Greyson.—So it is, my dear General. 
And now what do you intend to do? 

Moncada—Well, I will be ready 
to occupy Managua in a couple of 
days. Since the Diaz army is prac- 
tically broken up, I don’t think they 
can stand another attack. 


Greyson.—Indeed so—and that is 
just my reason for calling on you. 
You remember that my government 
recognized President Diaz, and is 
therefore obligated to protect him. 
Our forces here number 5000 men 
landed and eleven ships. We have five 
bombing planes, and can get more if 
needed. 


Moncada.—Carramba! And do you 
mean that your Government is going 
to fight the Liberals in the field? 

Greyson.—Why yes, if you try to 
enter Managua. 

Moncada.—But why? We have not 
done your government any harm. On 
the contrary, we have bowed our necks 
to every imposition and insult that your 
government has heaped upon us from 
the beginning of our troubles until 
now. We have not touched a hair of 
one American, nor even intentionally 
molested or destroyed their property.

A Play from Real Life 


The author of this play writes us: 

“Being a Negro in connection with 
the Liberal forces, I felt it would do 
no harm if I sent you a few lines 
that would help your readers to form 
an idea of the way the American forces 
in Nicaragua forced the victorious 
Liberals to disarm.”

>>> 


In Bluefields, when Schultz, Wuescher, 
and Gerlow took sides against us 
openly and even abused our soldiers, 
we did not even make them prisoners 
“at large’. Yes, when we caught 
them sneaking about the fire zone at 
Loma Mico, and could have executed 
them as spies, we left them alone and 
did not even threaten them. What 
pretext then can your Government 
have for fighting us? Could you call 
that justice? 

Greyson.—Talk of justice to Al- 
mighty God. They say that only He 
is just. We Americans don’t have 
much to do with Him, especially if 
He is really just. We believe in and 
speak of our Almighty dollars. If you 
have the dollars—justice, might, and 
right are all on your side. You for- 
get that I told you my Government 
has recognized Diaz. 


Moncada—So you have. But re- 
member your government had recog- 
nized Dr. Sacasa too, who was forced 
to flee for his life in October 1925, 
when Chamorro overthrew the Solor- 
zano Government by force of arms. 
Besides your government agreed not to 
recognize any Government in Nica- 
ragua that was set up by force of arms. 
The Diaz and Chamorro faction are 
one and the same, and Recognition is 
Recognition. If you are fighting for 
Diaz because you recognized him, why 
did you not fight for Sacasa in 1925, 
whom you had previously recognized ? 


Greyson.—You see General, Sacasa 
as president would mean a Liberal 
Government which would not suit us. 
You Liberals seem to have the good 
of your little Nicaragua more at heart 
than the Conservatives, and we can- 
not handle you as we would like. Now 
with Diaz especially we could get the 
whole of Nicaragua just for the asking. 

Moncada:—Yes, indeed. 

Greyson.—( Boastfully) — We con- 
trol your railroads. -Our bankers are 
making the best investments since start- 
ing business in Nicaragua. We have 
your canal for ninety-nine years, and 
don’t have to spend a cent to work it, 
while we are coining a fortune from 


our Panama canal. Any of our Amer- 
ican business companies can get all the 
lands they need for a mere pittance, 
never mind who were the previous 
owners. Isn’t it enough to fight for? 
You Liberals would not give us all 
these privileges therefore we must look 
out for our own interest. You must 
either surrender or fight us. 

Moncada.—But your government 
has not declared war on us. 

Greyson—O no. If we did that 
the American people would not stand 
for it, so we have to do it this way. 
Don’t you remember how many times 
Mr. Harding has declared that he 
would have no armed intervention? 
And even if he had declared that he 
would never recognize Chamorro or 
any of his clique, why he is President 
of the mightiest nation on earth. _ All 
power is given unto him. But to re- 
turn to the fighting question—you see 
we have to do it this way and prove 
the contrary to the world as Latimer 
did with the ammunition—prove that 
you attacked us and we had to fight 
back to save our lives. Of course if 
it had not been for Borah we would 
have wiped your little army off the 
globe months ago, but that big “gas- 
ser” tries hard to keep the American 
people posted about all our little ruses, 
so that we find it hard to start the 
scrap; but the Admiral will take care 
now to have all your messages cen- 
sored, so Mr. Borah will have to do 
some dreaming to learn how things are 
progressing. 

Moncada.—ls it come to this? 

Greyson.—Ay, more. I am author- 
ized by my government to tell you that 
it is of the highest importance to us 
to maintain Diaz as president, (al- 
though you have beaten him) until his 
term expires and in order that he may 
win the next term also, we have de- 
cided to supervise the coming elections, 
so as to prevent your having a kick 
should we find it necessary to resort 
to any of our American games to win 
the election for Diaz. We are deter- 
mined to use fair or forceful means to 
disarm your army. Do you agree to 
disarm and surrender? 

en ear anee Tym most emphatically 
no! 

Greyson.—We offer you anything 
except the Presidency. 

Moncada.—I cannot accept. We 
are fighting to uphold our constitution. 

Greyson.—I offer you the Govern- 
ment in all the Departments held by 
the Liberals, only Diaz must be presi- 
dent. 

Moncada—Diaz as president - is 
against our Constitution.

T was about four months ago that 

Brookwood Labor College, seques- 
tered away in the dales of Westches- 
ter County, at Katonah, New York, 
held a series of confabs on Negro la- 
bor problems. The meetings were held 
May 19th and 20th and covered four 
sessions. Papers were read by Rob- 
ert Bagnall, Charles S. Johnson, E. 
Franklin Frazier and Abram L. Har- 
ris. 

Charles Johnson spoke on present 
problems in the unionization of Negro 
workers; Robert Bagnall outlined the 
economic basis of the Negro’s strug- 
gle for civil liberty; Franklin Frazier 
gave an account of the origin of the 
Negro bourgeoisie; and Abram Har- 
ris talked on the Negro in the Amer- 
ican labor movement. The foregoing 
discussions took place in the afternoon 
of the first day. In the evening Rienzi 
Lemus of the Dining Car Waiters 
told of his comrades’ efforts to estab- 
lish collective bargaining in the dining 
car service; and Roy Lancaster of the 
Pullman Porters, who did not care to 
orate or to read an academic paper, 
provoked his audience into questioning 
him on his organization’s accomplish- 
ments and purpose. On the next day 
Norman Thomas, Director, League 
for Industrial Democracy, Benjamin 
Stolberg, labor economist and journal- 
ist, and W. H. DesVerney, Frank 
Crosswaithe and A. Philip Randolph, 
organizers of the Pullman Porters, 
spoke. A. J. Muste, Director of 
Brookwood, presided at all of the 
meetings. And Eva A. Frank, that 
ubiquitous spirit in American liberal- 
ism, stood watch throughout the long 
hours lest some of us should shirk when 
the gauntlet of criticism had to be 


run.

HIS somewhat belated reporting 

the event does not signify that 
the symposium was a fiasco, or that 
its significance was chilled by one of 
those tidal waves of reactionary-ism 
which recur periodically in the 
United States. Perhaps we should 
wait even longer than we have before 
attempting to forecast the meaning of 
such a conference. At any rate it can 
at present be said that the effect of the 
discussions and papers presented during 
this two day conference was more of 
the nature of intellectual guidance on 
labor economics fused with racial issues 
than of some definite accomplishment 
such as the adoption of futile resolu- 
tions. And labor, particularly in 
America, or when confronted with 
matters of race, needs intellectual guid- 
ance, despite its reliance on pragmatic 
business unionism and its traditional 
“Steering clear of theories of social de- 
velopment”’. 


ERE at Brookwood were gath- 

ered men and women whose 
world of experience centers in modern 
industrialism and the labor movement. 
They possess practical knowledge of 
the conflicting social habits induced by 
business traffic and the machine proc- 
ess. They know the meaning of fa- 
tigue, inadequate wages and long 
hours. And many of them, no doubt, 
have learned by rote, from their pro- 
genitors, unchronicled legends of 
bloody strife encountered by labor 
when it sought concessions from young 
capitalism. But did any of them know

from whence sprang the Negro’s songs 
of toil? Did they know that the Pull- 
man Porters’ Union, christened “The 
New Negro on the Economic Front- 
age” by panegyrists, is merely the end 
product of years of agitation conducted 
by conveniently forgotten “Old Ne- 
groes” and Negro labor’s disillusion- 
ment of organized white labor’s vol- 
uble pretenses of amity? Had it oc- 
curred to any of them that black labor 
as well as white has assisted in erect- 
ing American industrialism ; that white 
labor’s experience like that of black 
labor is rooted in servility and forced 
labor; that the rapid ascent of white 
labor from indentured servitude to the 
status of free labor whose work-1-day 
experience under nascent capitalism 
taught the value of collective bargain- 
ing and black labor’s debasement un- 
der a regime which placed a premium 
upon Negro servility and where the 
black craftsman’s genius was the over- 
lord’s means of double exploitation, 
were due more to a quirk in economic 
history than to the African’s natural 
unfitness for civilization or to the An- 
glo-Saxon’s divine superiority? Did 
they already know of the Negro arti- 
sans in the pre-Civil War period or 
of the violence which their intrusion 
into the skilled trades met in the 50’s 
and 60’s? Had they ever heard of the 
Negro in the Noble Order of Knights 
of Labor, or in the National Labor 
Union and its congresses; or of the 
Niagara Movement’s early declama- 
tion that white and black workers 
should close ranks? Of course all of 
them knew of the American Federa- 
tion’s temporizing strategy! If they 
did not already know these things they 
were told of them and more. . 

There, you have the gist of what 
happened. Judge for yourself the mo- 
mentousness of the conference.

sf .ONGAREE SKETCHES” by 

E. C. L. Adams with an intro- 
duction by Paul Green (University of 
North Carolina Press, 1927) is in two 
parts. First, there is a fine essay by 
Paul Green on Negro literature and 
art. Like everything that Green writes 
about the Negro it is at bottom full 
of the spirit of human brotherhood. 
It should be read by every American. 

With this is a collection of stories 
and incidents illustrating current folk 
tales of the South Carolina swamp re- 
gion. Some of these are slight but 
others like “The Hopkins Nigger’’ are 
well written and poetic bits of Negro 
lore, infinitely funny. Many varia- 
tions of this story of a Negro going to 
Heaven and so out-flying the white 
angels as to bring himself to grief 
through their jealousy are current in 
the South. 

’ Here and there in the other sketches 
are bits of rare poetry. Of the Death 
Owl it is said: 

“He ain’t nothen fer pleasure, for 
he voice is de soun’ of sorrow, an’ de 
answer is tears.” 

And the lines in the long poem: 

“Jesus had trouble, Jesus had trouble 

Trouble all over the world.” 

There is one oriticism which applies 
to the whole book and keeps it from 
being as sincere a piece of literature as 
it deserves to be. And that is the fact 
that the author has carefully cut out 
from all this folk stuff every reference 
to Negro ambition, education, aspira- 
tion to better earthly things, every sug- 
gestion that these people know of a 
Negro world of education, comfort and 
success. There is left a cynical belief 
in prejudice—God, Jesus and the An- 
gels help cheat the poor Negroes again 
and again—and a persistent, unques- 
tioning acceptance of the fact that you 
cannot expect justice from white people. 

This undoubtedly is true of the mass 
of Southern Negroes but it is only part 
of the truth; it is also true that even 
to the lowest black swamp peasant 
there are three worlds ever present to 
his imagination: his own, the world of 
the risen black man and the world of 
white folks. No current folk lore can 
omit any one of these and be true, com- 
plete and, therefore, to the fullest, 
artistic. Yet in this whole collection 
there is no allusion to one of these 
worlds. 

Notwithstanding this, here is a book 
one must read if only for the sake of 
that fragment of a Negro sermon 
where the dead man sleeps—

B. REUTER’S “The Ameri- 

e can Race Problem” (Thomas 
Y. Crowell and Company) 448 pages, 
is a book designed for schools and col- 
leges and is a characteristic piece of 
current academic writing. Reuter has 
read all the chief books cr the Negro 
and a large amount of periodical litera- 
ture. He knows current prejudices. 
He has collected in his book the opin- 
ions and statements on which most au- 
thorities agree; in matters where there 
is no standard opinion Reuter features 
his own. The result is that one finds 
here a good compendium of what other 
people have said, but no conclusions 
from Mr. Reuter that are worth re- 
peating. Most of his conclusions are, 
in accordance with dominating preju- 
dices, correctly pessimistic. ‘““The pres- 
ence of Negroes perverted the demo- 
cratic social institutions”; (page 118.) 
“The race is not at present in need 
of or in a position to support a greatly 
increased number of professionals”; 
(page 249.) “The total number of 
real educated Negroes in the country 
is not sufficient io make a faculty for 
one first class college”; (page 289.) 
“The body of artistic accomplishment 
to date is small and for the most part 
not of a high order”; (page 306.) 
“The masses of the race are unedu- 
cated and the majority grossly ignorant 
and backward”; (page 335.) And 
finally, “Prejudice is a reality in the 
racial situation. It is not less real and 
probably not less permanent than the 
physical marks of race”! (page 432.) 
As a partial balance to this sort of 
talk, Reuter acknowledges that there 
is no proof of the racial inferiority of 
the Negro; that there is great cultural 


diversity among them} that poverty has 


decreased; that their health has im-

proved and that their sex standards and 
moral life show “remarkable” ad-

The trouble, of course, with a book 
of this sort is that the writer is not a 
human being and is not acquainted 
with human beings. He is studying

sult, 


E. LAWRENCE’S “Revolt in 

« the Desert”, a widely read and 
recommended book,- is interesting to 
colored folk chiefly for the light which 
it throws on the methods of English 
imperalists. Here was a fine young 


. idealist who tried to free Arabia. His 


efforts and the efforts of the Arabs 
insofar as they coincided with Eng- 
lish designs were accepted. But when 
the time came for realization of Ara- 
bian ambitions England cilmly threw 
over Feisal and the hope of Arabian 
freedom. It was this probably more 
than anything else that lost the world 
that “400,000-word book” and the 
“whole bitter* account of his venture 
and of his disappointment over the con- 
clusion which the Peace Conference 
seemed to put to it”.

Ep ang collections of Negro folk-

edited by R. Nathaniel Dett and pub- 
lished by the Hampton Institute Press; 
and “My Spirituals”, collected by Eva 
A. Jessye and published by Robbins-

The first is a collection of severity 
of the spirituals arranged for solo 
voice, with pjano accompaniment. The 
collection contains several of Mr.

Fisher’s arrangements and arrange- 

~ fiients by-nine other: scholarly and sym- 
-piathetic musicians, including Harry T.

also the editor’s excellent essay on 
“Negro Spirituals”, —_ biographical 
sketches cf the ten musicians whose set- 
tings are used, explanatory notes on the 
individual songs and an_ excellent 
bibliography. 

The second collection gives fine evi- 
dence of Mr. Dett’s work with the 
student body of Hampton Institute. 
To the wealth of folk-song material 
which the students have brought to the 
Institute, Mr. Dett has applied his 
own fine musicianship and superior 
training. The result is an interesting 
collection of 165 of the religious folk- 
songs as sung at Hampton. The book 
is a hymn book in form, in content and 
in arrangement. As such it will be 
of great value to all who are inter- 
ested in the growth of Negro-Ameri- 
can folk music and of especial interest 
and help to those persons who are ac- 
tively engaged in the preservation of 
these songs by means of group singing. 
The editor’s introductory chapter is a 
valuable contribution tc the literature 
on the subject. 

Miss Jessye has brought together in 
the third collection sixteen songs as 
heard in her native Community in 
southern Kansas. She says: “They are 
songs of my child-hood and of my own 
people. I have sung them all my life”. 
These songs are arranged with piano 
accompaniment. The pages of the

HOSE of us who have been peg- 

ging along on one crutch for the 
last 40 years with The Story of an 
African Farm can pick another in 
From Man to Man, (Harper and 
Brothers, $2.50), and go merrily hop- 
ping on to 80. “I doubt whether a 
more important movement -has ever 
been launched, touching the destiny of 
the race, than this in regard to the 
equality of the sexes,” says William 
Lloyd Garrison. 

And I doubt if there ever was a 
braver little Lone Leader than Olive 
Schreiner fighting in South Africa all 
the years, fighting for freedom of 
thought and freedom of sexes and free- 
dom of the races. 

In the posthumous book From Man 
to Man we again smell the veldt, roll 
over in the sand, listen to. the cart 
wheels, count the clock-ticks, hear wild 
animals, see picturesque natives. We

Stranger riding by and once more lifts

us out of sluggishness held by . chains 
in slime and turns us facing the light 
busy chasing a white feather to a 
mountain top! 

A monogamous hon 
with a polygamous father; a weak sis- 
ter and her Jew lover in rainy London; 
these scenes are done in a mixed but 
fascinating style. Every fly’s eyelash 
is lifted. And when she dreams— 

“She’s a black nigger,” Frank re- 
peated, half under his breath, ‘and I’ 
never walk with her again.” He was 
talking of little Sartje. 

“Do you know, boys,” said Rebeckah 
suddenly after a pause, “sometimes I 
have had a dream. 
that as we are living here in this old 
world, just as we have always lived, 
suddenly there has arrived among us 
a strange, terrible, new race of peo- 
ple, coming from I know not where, 
perhaps from the nearest star.” 

She waited. 

“T have dreamed they were like us 
in body and mind, but with terrible 
white faces; our skins are tinted, but 
theirs were white as the driven snow, 
and their hair like thick threads of 
gold. 

24 . they were human; but there 
was this difference between them and 
us: that of many things, they knew 
what we did not, and they could do 
things we could not. 


iT E, here on our earth, have been 

so proud of our little cities 
and our little inventions, our ships and 
our books and our telescopes and our 
laws and our manners, and we have 
thought we were so wise and knew 
right from wrong, but suddenly when 
these terrible white-faced strangers 
came among us, all changed. . 

ae our cathedrals went into 
their cellars . they turned their 
heads from us, as we turn our heads 
from natives dressed in skins and rub- 
bed with fats. 

= . they would not ride in the 
same airships with us nor breathe the 
same currents of air; they called us 
‘The Inferior Races’. 

“You will hear people talking often 
of Inferior Races and of how superior 
we are—the people who may be speak- 
ing; but for me I know this, that if 
yeu took from me bit by bit all I have 
gained and learned from other races 
and other peoples in whom my blood 
never flowed, I should go back and 
back, and you would find me at last 
only a little cave mother with her baby 
tied by a skin on her back, peeping out 
at the door of the cave to see if the 
man. with his bone hook or flint arrows 
was coming home with game, while a 
dog who was not yet quite able to bark 
howled at the door. And when I 
think of all I have and all I know, 


pleading. 


I have dreamed. 








the only feeling I have is—‘Pass it on! 
Pass it on!’ 

“Its natural,” Rebeckah said, “that 
we should love those who are like our- 
selves. A little child feels very lonely 
if it has not another child of its own 
age and size to play with. And per- 
haps the greatest longing a human: be- 
ing can have is to find another being 
who feels and thinks as they do; and 
when they meet they are like two drops 
of water that run into one as soon as 
they touch. But, even if people aren't 
like us at all, deep down there is some- 
thing that joins us together; and if 
you shrink from them at first, if you 
are very kind to them and try to help 
them, its wonderful how you get to 
love them.” 

She had dropped ther right arm at 
her side, and the fingers of the hand 
were moving softly among the frizzled 
curls of Sartje’s head which she pressed 
back deep into hér mistress’s skirts, her 
drowsy eyes already full of sleep and 
dreams. 


ND, so, when I hear people 

talking of superior races and 
inferior peoples, and of keeping the 
races and peoples down, I hardly un- 
derstand. Because, if I find people 
who seem to know a little less or to 
see a little less than I do, I always 
feel I want to say to them, ‘Oh little 
earth brother and sister, climbing with 
me that long climb out of the dark, 
through the cave doors and on we do 
not know up where, if it should hap- 
pen that I have climbed on to a step 
a little bit higher than the one you 
stand on and can see a little farther— 
here is my hand—let me help you 
ae Sy 
“One thing I tell you lads,” she 
said quickly, in a changed voice, 5 
“it is this—I hope, I believe, I know, 
the day will come when you will re- 
gret utterly every slighting, every un- 
kind word or act, that you have ever 
given place to towards Sartje, and 
when you will be deeply grateful for 
every kind or generous thing you have 
done towards her. . . .” 

For over 30 years this book was in 
the making. It was never finished— 
like life itself.

| “DRAMATIS PERSONAE” 


aca 








Florence Mills 


ANNEN SWAFFER writing in 
the London, Eng., Daily Express 
says of Florence Mills: 

In a few days, Florence Mills and the 
“Black-Birds” company will leave Lon- 
don on a seven-weeks’ tour. They will 
see the English provinces for the first 
time and take with them, first to Black- 
pool, the wonderful dance show which 
has been running in London for nine 
months. . . . 

Florence Mills, it seems, dreams 
dreams of the future of ler people. One 
of her grandfathers was a white man. 
Otherwise—she is what is called a 
quadroon—she is entirely black. 

When feted, not long ago in the Pica- 
dilly cabaret, she burst out, suddenly, 
into a passionate plea for colored people. 
No one wrote it down. She has forgot- 
ten now what she said, but her eloquent 
plea for tolerance made an impression 
on many minds. 

“I want to help the colored people,” 
she told me. “I realize that, in my line 
of work, I am doing much to help them. 
The stage is the quickest way to get to 
the people. My own success makes peo- 
ple think better of other colored folk.” 


“I must say that I have found in Lon- 
don nothing but kindness and friendli- 
ness,” she said. “I have met lots of won- 
derful people, willing to help us in our 
great struggle. We have been given a 
chance to prove our worthiness and to 
feel that we are free.” 

Then Miss Mills told me of her dream. 

“My greatest ambition in life is to see 
the white people ignore the colored ques- 
tion,” she said. “This depends entirely 
upon ourselves. For ten years now the 
colored question has not been so acute. 
White people realize that the colored 
people are educated and more progres- 
sive. Conditions are better. 

“Yet, even to-day, there are many col- 
ored boys in America who, after being 
trained as lawyers and doctors, have to 
become train attendants because they are 
black and there is no place for them.” 

Paul Robeson and Roland Hayes, both 
talented men of color, have told me the 
same story. 

Florence Mills very much likes to read 
the books of Pushkin and Dumas, who 
had colored blood in them. She loves the 
music of Coleridge-Taylor, she says, be- 
cause he was black. 

“Yet it is ridiculous to think that we 
are different from white people,” she 
went on, “because we are educated and 
brought up to think the same way as 
you. After all, it is white authors whose 
books we read and it is a white culture 
that surrounds us. 

“Yet if we voice our opinion we are

downed. Sometimes I have started to 
argue and then heard: ‘What right have 
you to talk? You are black.’ 

“It is a little hard on us. In the South, 
colored mammies bring white babies up 
and actually feed them at their own 
breasts. Yet, when the same mammy has 
her own little black baby, the mother of 
the white baby does not allow her young- 
ster to play with the Negro child. 

“If a white person in a theatre is put 
next to a Negro, the white person objects. 
Yet the same white person will eat food 
cooked by a colored person and be waited 
on by another Negro. 

“I feel our visit here has done a lot 
of good. No one has complained about 
us. Some people have been to see our 
show, not only two or three times, but 
twenty or thirty times. This must sure- 


ly have helped. 

“No, I have never felt that I have been 
slighted once in England. When I am 
out and people recognize me, saying, ‘Oh, 
there’s Florence Mills’, they come over 
and introduce themselves and congratu- 
late me. 

‘When I was at Ascot last week I 
walked through the paddock, just like the 
white people and no one objected. At 
the Derby, two weeks before, I had most 
wonderful receptions wherever 1 went. 
In the streets even the children smile at 
me and say ‘Hello’, as I walk alcng.” 

As to the show itself, much has been 
written, but we append this word by 
G. H. in West Africa (London): 

“Blackbirds,” the revue at the Pavilion, 
in which practically all the artistes are 
Afro-Americans, (Turn to page 248)

The Little Page 


Calendar Chat 
{iro are two trees at the end of 


our pasture lot that were very in- 
teresting to us as children. They are 
attractive now. One is an elm and the 
other a wild black cherry tree. Both 
have spraying fan shaped tops. Of 
course the elm is larger and grander. 
Yet the black cherry tree was always 
lively with summer visitors. We went 
there for the funny little black cherries 
with their wooden seeds forming the 
greater part of the fruit after all. 

Some times we would climb the trees 
for the cherries or again we peppered 
the little slope where the tree grew 
black with cherries that one of us 
shook to the ground. They had a 
faintly sweet and a slightly bitter taste. 
Late in the summer they became 
shriveled up like black leather beads 
and had only a sweetish taste left to 
them. 

The elm tree attracted us because 
there were always so many birds meet- 
ing there and talking over their plans. 
We were anxious to pry into the crows’ 
and robins’ and orioles’ affairs and 
would try to meet them all at the elm. 
But no matter how many birds had 
been assembled among the great home 
like boughs, when we landed at the 
elms there would be only the wide rest- 
ful whisper of the leaves. 

This is September and already birds 
are meeting at the elm and arranging 
trips southward. For all seasons they 
have the branches as council chambers. 
I have seen hundreds of noisy black- 
birds flying out from here at the time 
of fall migrations as though they were 
closing an important meeting on when 
and where to fly. 

When the birds are all gone and 
winter comes the crows gather often 
in the black cherry boughs or in the 
storm swayed elm and caw and caw 
and caw as they plan for their winter 
raids. 


AD I not decided to talk about 

wrens I would have had rabbits 
for a subject this time. They have 
been so lively and common throughout 
the summer, much to the regret of 
farmers. The long eared robbers with 
their white snowball tails have deprived 
tables of some very delicious lettuce and 
have even gone into sweet pea beds to 
steal green seed peas. But they are 
such happy playful creatures in the sum- 
mer. I have seen little rabbits spring 
into the midst of a flock of English 
sparrows that were pecking on the 
ground and joyously put them to flight 


230 


EFFIE LEE NEWSOME 


Sine she (tun) 


even leaping into the air toward them. 

The wrens like the rabbits have been 
very merry and very busy too building, 
quarreling with English sparrows and 
feeding countless fledgelings. But the 
wrens were not destroying crops. In- 
stead sturdy Jenny Wren and her mate, 
who sings till it seems that his throat 
must burst, have been destroying harm- 
ful insects by dining upon these them- 
selves. and feeding them to young 
wrens. 

I watched a wren singing one morn- 
ing on the gable of the barn. He was 
fairly vibrating with song. Now and 
then he would flutter into the barn then 
rush out again to sing with all his 
might. Near by darting about a brush 
heap was his mate, brisk Jenny Wren, 
finding grubs and bugs for their little 
family. 

Another member of the wren family 
you would hear briskly calling “Red 
cedar, red cedar, red cedar” as you 
went to school, if you lived in the coun- 
try, is the Carolina wren, a cheery and 
eager little bird with the typical wren 
movements and nervously twitching 
long tail. Indeed when singing with 
these tails upturned wrens suggest little 
brown tea pots to me. I have often 
listened eagerly in the fall to Caro- 
lina Wren’s thrilling song, 


“Red cedar, red cedar! : 

My flitting time’s near,” he would seem 
to say, 

“Yet let me go leaving all things 

In good cheer. 

Red cedar! It’s autumn, 

Ve wrens must be gone. 

We'll come back in spring 

When the new leaves are on. 


Red cedar! Red cedar!” 
| WENT to the zoo a few days ago. 


I know you have often gone there. 
But most of us are attracted by some 


different object when we go. 

The polar bears. were just receiving 
their morning bath. A hose was be- 
ing turned in full force upon the great 
white bodies and their bread breakfast 
lay all about the wet cement floor. It 
was interesting to notice how they 
relished the cool bath. So did those 
largest of bears, those from Alaska. 

Then I went up, up the hill from 
the long rows of cement caves and 
came to beautiful slopes of grass. 
There was a white peacock of India 
with its tail lifted and spread till, 
against the background of dark grass, 
it looked like a great fan of Brussels 
lace. The fan was folded abruptly 
and trailed as a snowy bridal robe on 
the grass. It was fascinating to watch 
the graceful peacock. 


In All Other Studies They’d Balk 


ROF. PEA GREEN the parrot 
Kept school in a garret 
To teach other parrots to talk. 
The way they learnt mocking 
Was something quite shocking. 
In all other studies they'd balk. 


The Gardener ° 
| THINK I'll be a gardener 


When I’m a grown up man, 
And have my peas and beans come up 
As early as I can. 


Now when my peas are little vines, 
Why then I’m going to fix 
Something for them to climb upon, 
Made out of strings and sticks. 


Then when my peas are all quite grown, 
And big and green and pretty, 

I’ll haul them in my truck to sell 

To markets in the city. 


The Ducks 


N moonlight nights the ducks go 
strutting round, 
Making a little squawking sort of sound. 
Then in the afternoon each tucks its 
head 
Under one wing and seems to go to bed. 
All sit together, drowsy, on the grass, 
And yet somehow, they hear us as we 
pass. 


The Elm 


HE pear trees fork so near the 
ground 
That they’re not hard to climb, 
I like to get into a tree 
That takes a little time. 
I'll leave the girls the pear and peach, 
An elm tree top is best to reach.

Three Sketches from Nature 
By MARJORIE MARSHALL 


1. 
The Dryad 


HE dawn with crystals fresh 
bedecked her hair, 

The zephyrs breathed their 
adoration low, 

And earth’s chaste fruits 
ecstatically dared 

To kiss her lips! their ardent 
love to show. 


2. 


A Twilight Reverie 


ERMAID in your green and crim- 
son gown 
Riding joyfully a moon-lit wave, 
Sometime slipping shadow-like away 
Hiding in a sea where stars are drowned; 


Hew your sparkling floods of careless 


glee 

Wake to restless dreams my brooding 
heart, 

Taunt my fettered soul from out the 
dark— 


Nature’s dark, it binds me, sets you free. 


3: 
At Sunset 
CRIMSON blush envelops all the 
west 
‘Thru sunset gold frail clouds firs: move 
then rest, 


Now pausing, keeping long a sacred hush, 
Now tumbling from a height with down- 


ward rush 

They quickly drop behind a wind-swayed 
rim 

Of curtains, soft, with palest ash-grey 
fringed. 


Like victor horses racing with fine scorn 

The bright hued clouds speed past—are 
quickly drawn 

Within a maze of rose, there in a whirl 

Their sumptuous hues like banner flags 


unfurl. 

Like waves they toss, still vying each with 
each 

‘Til bade by ‘the celestial sun, keep 
peace. 


As fast their colors fade they merge as 
one, 

And sink in glory with the setting sun: 

Ethereal phantoms of the dark’ning sky 

Like pastel oils they smooth from sight, 
and die. 

The west illumines with a suffused glow 

The purple shadows deepen, so they go. 


September, 1927 











May Howard Jackson 


@ There is among us one woman who 
is far less known than is her rightful 
due. May Howard Jackson is an art- 
ist in sculpture—temperamental, with- 
drawn and shunning publicity, and yet 
endowed with unusual ability. Mrs. 
Jackson was born in Philadelphia, the 
daughter of Floarda Howard and Sallie 
Durham. She was educated in the 
public schools of Philadelphia, was 
graduated from Tadd’s Art School and 
was the first colored girl to win a 
scholarship at the Philadelphia Aca- 
demy of Fine Arts. Here she studied 
four years. In 1902 she married Wil- 
liam T. S. Jackson of Washington, D. 
C. Mrs. Jackson’s chief work has been 
portrait busts of Americans of mixed 
Negro and Caucasian descent. Her 
ability at this kind of portraiture is 
marvelous and her exhibits at the Cor- 
coran Art Gallery at Washington and 
Veerhoff’s as well as in New York City 
have brought her much favorable com- 
ment. She has made busts of Archi- 
bald Grimké, W. E. B. Du Bois and 
Kelly Miller among others. 


Black Men 
By LUCIA TRENT 


WIFT gusts of hollow night wind 
clatter by; 
To-night the earth is leper-pale and still. 
The moon lies like a tombstone in the sky. 
Three black men sway «pon a lonely hill. 


The pain has withered from each tor- 
tured face. 


De 


Soon earth will hide them with a 
mother’s care, 

But never God’s great mercy can erase 

A bitter scorn for men who hung them 
there. 


Vagabondia 


By MARION GREEN SCOTT 


HE roistering wind is strumming 
on its harp strings wild and gay, 
‘Vhe quivering boughs are humming 
with its music as they sway, 
Oh let-me wander, wander through 
its roaring shrieking blast, 
And feel its thrilling freedom 
as it whistles shrilly past. 


The clear raindrops are sparkling 

as they fall on jeweled grass, 
The woodland pool is darkling 

from the cloudlets as they pass, 
Oh let me wander, wander 

through the misty rain-kissed air 
And feel the stirring, pulsing 

life that throbs in gladness there. 


The little brook is tinkling as 
it ripples swiftly by, 

And fairy eyes are twinkling 
where its sunny shallows lie, 

Oh let me wander, wander near its 
mystic clear refrain, 

And feel its dreamy loveliness in 
every flowing vein. 


For strumming wind and sprakling 
rain and purling dimpling stream 
Arouse in me a kindred mood, a 
rare and lovely dream, 
And I must wander, wander 
through the wide earth fancy free 
Until I see my dream fulfilled 
in perfect harmony. 


When Streams Met 
By JOHN LEE HIGGINS 


6¢— CAN go anywhere!” he stoutly 
said; 

Assurance that was happy, but I thought 

A little too insistent as I caught 

His twisted brow of pain. The way 
was spread 

With wistful dreams that vainly urged 
belief. 

The words were sweet, consoling to the 
taste; 

Resaid with pity, bitterness and haste 

To cover up his agony of grief. 

“T can go anywhere!” was in his breath; 

Dissembling still and still I saw the rain 

That filled his eyes with flowing streams 
again: 

Yet words of wine were in this shibbo- 
leth. 

Within the veins of his resurging blood, 

A thin gold stream was racing with the 
flood.

THE FAR HORIZON 








nk 


ADVANCE IN MEDICINE 
R. WILLIAM A. HINTON of 


the Wasserman Laboratory of the 
Massachusetts Department of Public 
Health and the Department of Bac- 
teriology of the Harvard Medical 
School is a colored man and the great- 
est American authority on the Was- 
serman test for syphilis. 

The Boston Medical and Surgical 
Journal has an article by Hinton an- 
nouncing the discovery of a newer and 
simpler test. The Journal says edi- 
torially : 

In reading the report of his study, one 
is impressed with the simplicity of his 
test and although his cases are yet too 
few to permit any final judgment, it 
would seem that this test, which will 
probably be called the “Hinton test”, is 
quite as reliable in its results as is the 
Wasserman test. 

If the Wasserman test, with its rela- 
tively high cost, its delicate reagents; 
dificult of preparation and subject to 
many deleterious influences; with the 
skill required in its performance, and the 
judgment demanded for its proper inter- 
pretation and with its false positives and 
negatives, if this test can be replaced by 
a test, inexpensive to use, with simple, 
easily prepared and stable reagents, re- 
quiring no great skill in setting up the 
test or in reading the results, a test giv- 
ing results at least as dependable as those 
of the Wasserman test, then the contribu- 
tion of Hinton should constitute an ad- 
vance in the aid which the laboratory 
can give the clinician in the diagnosis 
and treatment of syphilitic infections. 

This is probably the greatest con- 
tribution of a Negro to medicine in 
modern days. 


THE NEW MIGRATION 


WITH every opening economic op- 
portunity in the North, with every dis- 
aster, lynching and spread of race dis- 
crimination in the South, the Negro 
comes North. This northern migra- 
tion has been going on for a century. 
It will continue for another century 
or until the South comes to its senses; 
and there are indications of such san- 
ity in the South now and then. Here 
comes, for instance, the Virginian 
Pilot of Norfolk, Virginia, comment- 
ing upon the steady loss of Negro 
workers in New Orleans, Birmingham, 
and the old foolishness of trying to stop 
migration by law and force. The edi- 
torial goes on to say: 

The concern of the cities of the lower 
South over their dwindling Negro popu- 
ations is not misplaced. Without the 


September, 1927 





Negro, Southern industry would be at a 
standstill in almost evéry locality. But it 
may be doubted if the Negro can be per- 
suaded to stay where he is by “educa- 
tional work” under Chamber of Com- 
merce auspices or by appeals made from 
Negro pulpits. The only way for South- 
ern cities or Southern rural districts to 
keep their Negro workers is to make 
cqnditions attractive enough to create in 
them a desire to stay. Better houses, 
better schools, better streets in Negro 
sections, adequate allocations of funds for 
Negro recreation grounds and public 
parks, higher wages—these are some of 
the inducements that would exercise the 
most persuasive appeal. Southern com- 
munities can do more to check the move- 
ment of Negroes northward by working 
along these lines than by a hundred cam- 
paigns of propaganda or a hundred re- 
strictive statutes. Propaganda is no bet- 
ter than the realities which lie behind it 
and the reality in this case is that Negro 
housing and Negro living conditions in 
many a Southern city are such as to make 
the Negroes want to leave. As for re- 
strictive statutes, it is to be remembered 
that they are wholly out of harmony with 
the spirit of fair play which should ani- 
mate all relations between the two races. 
Fairness requires that the Negro be al- 
lowed every opportunity to learn the eco- 
nomic advantages of other regions. The 
operations of labor agents like the opera- 
tions of oil stock salesmen may deserve 
a careful scrutiny at the hands of the 
State, but responsible solicitors appeal- 
ing to Negro labor are entitled to the 
same freedom as responsible solicitors ap- 
pealing to white workers. A denial of 
such freedom defeats its own purpose in 
the end. Prohibitory legislation designed 
to prevent Negro workers from exercis- 
ing free choice is sure to build up a struc- 
ture of dissatisfaction that will tend to 
hasten rather than to retard the exodus 
to the North. 

Meantime, those well-known cen- 
ters of democracy and patriotism, 
Washington, D. C., and New Orleans, 
have sought to add to the difficulty and 
have received a salutary lesson. The 
embattled Rotary Babbits had invited 
the Y. W. C. A.°to the national cap- 
ital and the A. A. U. to the Crescent 
City, with the usual tag “No Negroes 
admitted”. Both invitations have been 
refused. That of the Y. W. C. A. al- 
most secretly so as to offend none of 
those dear Southern friends; but the 
A. A. U. comes out openly with this 
fine word: “The Amateur Athletic 
Union being a national and patriotic 
body has no right to bar any man from 
those games because of race or creed,” 
says Secretary Fred W. Rubien. And 


commenting on the refusal of New Or- 


leans to allow Negroes to compete with 
white persons in the garnes, he adds: 
“Tl had hoped that such a stand never 
would be taken in America.” 

But while the forward-looking 
South and the timid North are standing 
up for decent treatment of the Negro 
the difficulty is in dealing with the 
country districts of the South. We 
quote from an editorial in the New 
Era of Eunice, Louisiana. Eunice is 
a little town in southern Louisiana, 
in the Parish of Acadia. It had in 
1920 a population of 3,272 persons, of 
whom 1,013 were Negroes. It is sit- 
uated in the southwestern white belt 
just outside the black belt district. The 
editors remarks: 

The Louisiana Weekly, a Negro pub- 
lication, in New Orleans, proudly pic- 
tures a black upon its front page an- 
nouncing to its readers that Mr. W. A. 
McCullough, 34, of South Carolina 
birth, is the only Negro postmaster in 
the Pelican State. The article continues 
stating that the Negro meets with no 
opposition from the white people of 
Walkertown, Jefferson parish, the com- 
munity which he is serving. 


Another article criticises Superinten- 
dent Healey of the police department for 
ignoring a complaint filed by the editor 
ot the journal, relative to discourteous 
treatment accorded the educated “nig- 
ger” on Mardi Gras day. Then there is 
praise and rejoicing at the decision of the 
supreme tribunal in rendering the Texas 
primary law void, because a black was 
refused a vote in a senatorial election. 
Segregation laws are attacked by the 
writers employed by the journal. Not 
content with the numerous insults, the 
editor again slurs a white United States 
senator, who said that Negroes did not 
or never would vote in his state. 


Clamoring for constitutional -rights is 
one of the arguments of an editorial, 
while other comment seeks to ridicule the 
police force of the city of New Orleans 
for arresting blacks for drunkenness and 
reckless driving, while white drivers go 
exonerated. 

Should such literature continue to en- 
ter the homes of the Negroes of Louisi- 
ana, then the citizens of our common- 
wealth may in several years look to a 
race situation rivaled only by the city of 
Chicago. Are the backbones of the peo- 
ple of Jefferson parish and Walkertown 
made of sponge-like material, or has a 
love of the filthy Negro been born within 
their inner selves?- One would readily 
believe this to be a verity, due to the ar- 
ticles found in the celebrated Lowisiana 
W eekly. 

No, Mr. Negro, you have not voted 
in Louisiana and you are not going to 
vote. There remains within the bounds 


237 


of this great state enough he white men 
to shoulder guns when the occasion de- 
mands to prevent you from casting a bal- 
lot. If you are of the opinion that your 
children are going to be allowed the same 
privileges in our schools, theatres and 
general society you are badly mistaken. 
Should you wish to attain your “consti- 
tutional rights’, you might later learn 
that the Negro undertaking parlors of 
your vicinity will be filled with those of 
your race who have gone to another land 
to acquire your privileges. 

Rope and gunpowder still remains 
plentiful. Rope and gunpowder has kept 
you in submission for many years and if 
there is not an unexpected shortage on 
the market they will continue to afford 
you with your “constitutional rights”. 
White superintendents of the police 
forces have not become obligated to pro- 
tect you from “discourteous treatment”. 
Stay in your place and you will not have 
to appeal to the police forces of the state 
to protect your thick-headed skulls. 

Should you wish to occupy the white 
residential sections our advice is that you 
try just once. Build you a home next to 
the white decent people and then move 
in. After you have done this see how 
long your home will be occupied by your 
family and then it might be advisable to 
count the number of black casualties. 

The glorified South has been down in 
intelligence standards long enough with 
you. The South has grown with the 
Negro tied to its neck as a burden. when 
progress was desired. Your morals are 
nothing. Your society will not be per- 
mitted to intermingle with ours. There 
still remains sons and grandsons of those 
who wore the grey in 1861-65 and these 
same sons are as red-blooded as their 
forefathers and when “niggers” deem it 
advisable to claim equality with the 
white race of the South they are going 
to meet cold steel in opposition. Ifyou 
want to be cuddled and mugged over by 
the whites you had better pack your be- 
longings and leave the South, for such 
will never be permitted. 

We give below a poem entitled “Black 
America” which was published in the 


issue of March 12: 


“Yes, black, but withal—proud, 
With the blood lineage 

Of thousands of dark, sinewy bodies 
Surging through pulsing veins. 


“Black, yes, but—ambitious, 
With monuments of achievement 
Rearing high in proud 
Defiance of sneering skeptics. 


“Black, but ever pushing forward 
With a glorious record 

For advancement never before 
Rivaled by any race.” 


Here you have a picture of what the 
Negroes of today are agitating. You 
now realize that their ambitions must be 
kept in due bound. It is evident that the 
numbskulls can not be accorded good 
treatment. The Negroes should not be 
permitted to loiter around streets, un- 
employed and should be forced to always 
stay in their places, even though it is 


deemed “discourteous”, by the Louisiana 
W eekly.

IN TENNESSEE POLITICS 


G. Tom Taylor was appointed act- 
ing postmaster at Memphis by Post- 
master General Harry New this after- 
noon. The appointment will be effec- 
tive July 1. ‘[aylor is here and will 
reecive his official papers in the next 
tew days. He then will depart im- 
mediately for Memphis. 

Taylor’s appointment occasioned no 
surprise at the federal building. Re- 
publican politicians virtually conceded 
his selection Saturday when they 
learned he had landed on the eligible 
list despite the fact he was over the 
age limit. 

“Lily white” Republicans are up in 
arms. They declare that Taylor’s 
achievement reveals that Bob Church, 
Negro politician, has more power in 
Washington than all Memphis mem- 
bers of the Southern States Republican 
league.” This organization is fighting 
to put the control of the Republican 
Party in the South in the hands of 
white leaders. 

Church still is absent from the city. 
He is believed to be in the East. It 
is reported here that he accompanied 
Coolidge as far as Hammond, Ind., 
when the presidential party left on its 
vacation trip for the Black Hills of 
South Dakota. 

Previously the president broke sev- 
eral important engagements to give 
Church an audience. The naming of 
Taylor to the eligible list followed. 

Republican politicians say Church 
has had a life-long ambition to name a 
postmaster at Memphis, and that at 
one time Will Hays virtually promised 
him this distinction. However, white 
Republicans were able to upset the 
program.

SOUTH AFRICA 


In THe Crisis for March, 
we carried a large part of the text 
of the speech which Premier Hertzoz 
of the Union of South Africa deliv- 


1926, 


ered in November, 1925. It was a 
proposed solution of the South African 
color question. These proposals have 
now been drafted into four bills and 
are being discussed by the South Afri- 
can Parliament. They seek to draw a 
line between colored people and full- 
blooded natives. Colored people are 
still to be barred from inter-marriage 
with whites, are “Jim Crowed” in 
travel, kept out of trade unions and 
disfranchised in cities and states. In 
other respects they are to be treated 
as white persons, e. i., in their na- 
tional franchise, in the right to buy 
land and the right to travel without 
passes. Colored men can already vote 
in Cape Colony and Natal. These 
proposed laws will enable them to vote 


on union matters in the Transvaal and 
and the Orange Free State. 

For the natives parallel institutions 
for local and national government are 
being set up under the domination of 
the whites: natives are to elect seven 
white men to represent them in Par- 
liament but these representatives cannot 
vote on certain fundamental matters. 
The new Union Native Council is to 
consist of fifty members of whom fif- 
teen will be government nominees. Na- 
tives are no longer to vote in Cape 
Colony. No new land is opened up 
for natives, but 22,000 square miles 
are “released” for free competition be- 
tween white and black owners. For 
the educated native who does aot live 
with his tribe there is practically no 
provision made in these bills. 

The International Federation of 
Trade Unions at Amsterdam has writ- 
ten to the South African Government 
urging the withdrawal of the four bills 
on the ground that they are “unwor- 
thy of a state claiming a place among 
the civilized countries of the world”. 


“THE GLORY THAT WAS 
GREECE!” 


A new star has been discovered in the 
bright firmament of South Dakota’s 
literati. Unhappily, however, the state 
will not be able to honor its newest 
genius, for he, or she, has chosen to 
maintain shy anonymity. The manu- 
script which revealed the talent of this 
gifted writer appeared only.a couple of 
days ago in the form of a gfeen hand 
bill, starting with the question: “Do 
you know that a Greasy Greek is mak- 
ing the Ice Cream that you get from 
the ... creamery?” It then continues, 
with all the superb craftsmanship of a 
six-year old boy, to point out various 
indiscretions ef which this “Greasy 
Greek” is guilty, and concludes with 
the admonition that the manager of the 
contaminated firm should “Fire Your 
Greek or be a Greek and sell to Greeks 
or be a white man and deal with white 
men if you want white men to deal with 
you.” The final master touch is given 
by appending the “Sioux Falls Forward” 
slogan.

HAW DESMOND of England 


has been lecturing in America. 
He says in the New York Times: 


It was on one of the oldest of Southern 
plantations in the black belt of the Mis- 
sissippi that I found my most apprecia- 
tive audience, if loving hearts and wide-

There was no banjo, to my great 
sorrow, for the local preachers had been 
telling the darkies that “the debbil was 
in the ole banjo.” Instead, the colored 
orchestra played on trombones and trum- 
pets. How they beat that big drum!

TRIUMPH 


T last the National Association 

for the Advancement of Colored 
People together with Dr. Ossian H. 
Sweet, his wife, his brother and eight 
other colored men have been freed 
from guilt and prosecution. Their of- 
fense was to defend Dr. Sweet’s home 
and family by shooting into a mob 
September 5, 1925, and killing Leon 
Breiner. On July Ist, 1927, the au- 
thorities of Detroit formally gave up 
all attempt further to prosecute and 
persecute these people. It cost $37,849 
in cash and a year’s work on the part 
of officials of the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored People 
to bring this result. It is possible to 
get justice in the United States but one 
has to be able and ready to pay a 
fortune for it. 


HIGHER EDUCATION 


O set of protagonists defending a 

good cause have ever received 
more striking vindication than those 
American Negroes who fought for 
higher education from 1906 to the in- 
auguration of Mordecai Johnson. 

That “silly” desire for “Greek and 
Latin” was once derided by all the pro- 
fessional white and black saviors of 
the Negro race. Friends of Negro col- 
leges were refused hearing, driven 
from their jobs and ridiculed in the 
public press. Yet it is higher educa- 
tion that has saved the Negro race and 
the college departments at Hampton 
and Tuskegee are the most astonish- 
ing proofs of the way in which cheap 
manual training has been compelled to 
lengthen, deepen and broaden itself 
even to the granting of college degrees. 

Who would have dreamed at the 
beginning of the 20th Century, when 
all the “best friends” of the Negroes 
were sneering at Negro colleges be- 
cause they had few college students, 
that in 1927 we should find in Negro 
colleges alone ten thousand students of 
full college grade! Who can realize 
what it means for*nearly two thousand 
colored youth to maintain themselves 
in the great northern institutions of 
learning despite poverty and discrim- 
ination and to graduate in a single year 
at least forty persons with the degree 
of Master of Arts? 


September, 1927 























































The Late Alonso F. Herndon 


Not only this, but these black 
Americans, who could only furnish a 
faltering thousand of college students 
in 1900, are today furnishing not only 
students but teachers of students. They 
are taking charge of their own greatest 
institutions and they are even entering 
the teaching ranks of white institutions. 
Only one Negro institution in the 
United States refuses to have a Negro 
professor and that is Lincoln of Penn- 
sylvania. 

The revolution of Negro education 
is astonishing. All that is needed now 
is for black folk themselves to see that 
no young Negro of ability is refused 
a chance for college training. This 
means investigation, encouragement 
and money. Above all, money and still 
more money for scholarship funds. 


ALONZO HERNDON 
LONZO HERNDON was an 


extraordinary man and illustrates 
at once the possibilities of American 
democracy and the deviltry of 
color prejudice. Anywhere but in the 
United States he would have been 
regarded as a white man. His father 
was white and probably seven of his 
eight great grandparents were white; 
but he was classed as “colored”. He 
was born in a miserable little Georgia 
town as a slave in 1858. He was given 





practically no education. He plowed 
and labored through his childhood. 
Then he came to Atlanta. 

When he died the other day he had 
an income, certainly of $25,000 a year 
and possibly of $50,000. He owned 
real estate, a string of barber shops and 
a large industrial insurance society. He 
had built a beautiful home near At- 
lanta University; he had sent his only 
son through college. 

He did this in the face of every dis- 
couragement. He had no right to 
vote; he was continually in danger of 
mob violence; laws were passed to put 
him out of business; white men who 
were his moral, mental, physical and 
business inferiors called him “Alonzo”, 
and he could be insulted with impunity 
by any white Atlanta hoodlum. 

Nevertheless, he became a man of 
integrity and power,—power because 
of his money; power because of his 
firm friendships with numbers of the 
most influential white men of his city; 
power because of his keen business 
mind and organizing ability. 

He was not a man of broad sympa- 
thies and knowledge of the world. 
How could he be? But he gave gen- 
erously to charities which he knew and 
to movements which he understood. 

His first wife, Adrienne McNeil, 
was a woman of extraordinary dramat- 
ic ability. She studied with Froh- 
man and Belasco and once Thomas 
Dixon, in blissful ignorance of her Ne- 
z:o0 descent, offered lier the position of 
icading 'ady in ““The Klansman”! 

This representative of Negro Amer- 
ica lies dead today and buried in a sepa- 
rate Negro cemetery which he helped 
found; but if ever an American 

“burst his birth’s invidious bar” 
that man was Alonzo Herndon. 


LEGAL AID 


INCE the raising of our Defense 

Fund the number of applications 
and appeals to the National Office for 
Legal Aid has steadily increased. These 
are based upon cases of every sort, 
ranging from appeals for help for a 
man convicted of murder down to ap- 
peals for help for a widow about to 
have the mortgage on her home fore- 
closed. It is the unpleasant and some- 
times painful duty of the National Of- 


239 


fice and the Legal Committee to rule 
out at once a large number of these 
cases. 


In property matters, for example, the 
Legal Committee gives ‘the best ad- 
vice it possibly can, but it cannot rec- 
ommend the use of money from the 
Defense Fund in these purely civil and 
personal matters. 


Nor can the Defense Fund be used 
as a mere legal air fund. There are a 
large number of cases-in which a mis- 
carriage of justice is indicated but to 
furnish money for defense and prose- 
cution in all of the cases brought to 
the attention of the Association would 
require a sum of several hundred thou- 
sand dollars a year. 


The Defense Fund which has been 
entrusted to the Association is com- 
paratively small and should, therefore, 
be used only where it will be most ef- 
fective and secure the most far-reaching 
results. 


The National Office and the Legal 
Committee, therefore, have laid down 
as a governing policy the following 
tests: (1) Is the case one involving 
discrimination and injustice because of 
race or color; (2) will entry into the 
case serve to establish a precedent that 
will favorably affect the rights of col- 
ored people as a whole. 

This policy was followed in taking 
up the Louisville Segregation Case 
which resulted in a Supreme Court De- 
cision affecting the citizenship status 
and rights of Negroes all over the 
United States; also in the Arkansas 
Cases, in which we not only saved the 
lives of twelve innocent Negro farmers 
and released sixty-seven others from 
prison but opened up the whole ques- 
tion of peonage, which affects the eco- 
nomic and social condition of Negro 
farmers all over the South; also in the 
Sweet Case in Detroit in which was 
tested the application to the Negro of 
one of the most ancient principles in 
the English common law, the right of a 
man to protect his home against any in- 
vasion whatsoever; also in the Texas 
White Primary Case in which a de- 
cision was won affecting the citizenship 
and political status of Negroes through- 
out the South; and in other less known 
cases of the same sort. 

This policy rules out a great many 
deserving and, in many instances, pa- 
thetic cases, but to take up all of the 
deserving cases would be to convert the 
Association into a mere legal aid so- 
ciety, and it would require an annual 
outlay far beyond anything we can 
hope to command. 


HARLEM 


O none is it more difficult to steer 
between the Scylla of prudery and 
the Charybdis of unbounded license 


240 


than to the present American Negro. 
Harlem is freedom—the bursting of 
bonds, bonds of peonage, of caste, of 
poverty, of religion. The result is 
crime, gambling, sexual depravity, 
waste, luxury, self-assertion, science 
and art. It is a task of the utmost 
delicacy and difficulty to curb excess 
in Harlem and leave reasonable free- 
dom, to attack crime and leave art, to 
curb sadism and leave the free spirit. 
And the task is made doubly difficult 
by the white onlookers—the writer and 
visitor from Broadway. They must be 
made to remember that Harlem is not 
merely exotic, it is human; it is not a 
spectacle and an entertainment, it is 
life; it is not chiefly cabarets, it is 
chiefly homes; it is not all color, song 
and dance, it is work, thrift and sacri- 
fice. Left to itself with reasonable 
policing and sound public opinion, it 
will become a city of human hearts 
with more good for the world than bad. 
But bribed and bought by white 
wastrels, distorted by unfair novelists 
and lied about by sensationalists, it 
will lose sight of its own soul and wan- 
der bewildered in a scoffing world. 


WAR AND PEACE 
HAVE been a reader of your maga- 


zine for many years—a warm ad- 
mirer of your manly stand for the ad- 
vancement of the members of the 
Negro race. 

Your magazine has and does yet re- 
ceive staunch support from the mem- 
bers of the Twenty-fifth Infantry and 
I myself have had something to do 
with the support it receives. 

You will, I am sure, permit me to 
invite your attention to some of the 
statements in your issue of July, 1927 
—a front page editorial under the cap- 
tion: “As the Crow Flies”, especially 
the following: 

“Meantime, we need not less but more 
funds for health, for education, for social 
uplift. We ought to get this by taxing 
the rich and by spending less for silly 
and dangerous battleships and for the 
salaries of impudent army officers.” 

As citizens of the United States and 
as members of the Twenty-fifth In- 
fantry, an organization which, in our 
opinion, is doing as much for the ad- 
vancement of the Negro race as any 
University in the country—we take 
serious exceptions to the justice of that 
statement. 

We do not feel that our battleship 
program is silly and from my experi- 
ence of many years in the military ser- 
vice my observation is that army of- 
ficers are not generally impudent—cer- 
tainly they are less impudent than any 
other similar body of citizens 

It is believed that in permitting 
yourself and your magazine to sponsor 
such pacifist-bolshevik doctrines you 


are lessening your influence in your 
chosen field of endeavor in which you 
have done so much good. 
Louis A. CarTErR, 
Chaplain, 25th Infantry. 


N your letter of July 15th you take 

exception to my statement that (1) 
battleships are “silly and dangerous”, 
(2) that there are “impudent army of- 
ficers” and (3) you fear that I hold 
“Pacifist-Bolshevik doctrines”. 

In answer, may I say that the very 
fact that great nations of the world 
are today trying to limit the number 
of warships shows that the whole pro- 
gram of spending on one instrument of 
murder enough money to endow a 
great university, is in the opinion of 
the best minds of the world, “silly and 
dangerous”. (2) I do not mean to 
say that all army officers are impudent. 
How could I, when I knew Colonel 
Young and General Barnum? But I 
do insist that a large number of them 
are and this was proven by their atti- 
tude toward colored officers during the 
World War. Large numbers of white 
army officers at that time were more 
anxious to insult Negroes than to 
fight Germans. (3) I am a Pacifist. 
So was Jesus Christ. I am not sure 
as to what you mean by the word 
“Bolshevik”. If you mean everything 
that is contemptible, cruel and wrong, 
I do not think that I deserve the name; 
but if you mean to apply the word to 
those people who are striving with 
partial success to organize Industry 
for public service rather than for pri- 
vate profit, then I also am a Bolshevik 
and proud of it. 

I trust that even with this knowl- 
edge of my personal aims and attitudes 
we may continue to have your sym- 
pathy and the support of your great 
regiment for THe~Crtsis and the 
N. A. A. C. P. 

W. E. B. Du Bors. 


“HAVE enclosed a letter to Dr. Du 
Bois which please hand to him with my 
apology. ‘The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan 
is purely and simply a large strong box 
whose keys are in the hands of men 
who forget that ‘Lex talionis’ is as real 
today, as it was in the days of Jacob 
and Esau. 

“Anything in his name would not 
pass the vigilant watch, for his name 
is a byword in all political circles. So 
I think it is safer to send his letters in- 
cogrito.” 


DESIRE -to thank you from the 
depths of my heart for your touch- 


ing, beautiful, comprehensive and 
truthful tribute to my beloved friends 
John and Agnes Work, that appears 
in the July Crisis.

Did you not hear how a jest was made 
of these things, 

And how the audience was moved by 
currents of good-natured laugh- 
ter? 

Well, let us laugh at all this together. 


T may be that we can laugh it away 
as we helped to laugh away 
anti-suffrage, 

As we helped to laugh away duelling 
and certain absurdities of chiy- 


alry. 
God knows, we cannot always 
laugh... 


That there are days when the earth 
is shadowed 

By four lines of lynching news in a 
morning paper. 

We cannot always laugh. 

But sometimes we can laugh. 

“Equality?” one says. ‘The colored 
race would not want social 
equality. 

They would not be comfortable.” 

We can laugh and reply: ‘“Comfort- 
able? 

You do not know the new Negro, 

The new intellectuals. 

Comfortable? Unless you could meet 
them intellectually 

They would not even know that you 
were in the room.” 

But say it with laughter, with laugh- 
ter! 

For it is only a problem in arithmetic 
that we have to solve. 

It is only that we must teach one race 

That there are four other races. 

And the white race has a sense of hu- 
mor—sometimes. 

It can learn.

out the army and the navy to protect 
you. Now, that is just the com- 
mon sense of it and my advice to 
colored citizens in all these Southern 
states would be to qualify and take 


advantage of this decision recently 
rendered by the United States 
Supreme Court, making themselves 


political factors locally, which has in 
it some intrinsic worth beyond glorying 
in the fact: “I helped to elect Coo- 
lidge.” 


OW, my friends, we have got a 

big job; but we are going at it. 
When I sat with Miss Ovington and 
watched this great crowd filing in I 
wondered what must have been her 
thoughts when she remembered the 
two or three people who gathered to- 
gether in a little room in New York 
City eighteen years ago and conceived 
the idea of this organization. At that 
time we could get only a few people 
together and here we have these ten 
thousand people this afternoon. But 
we have got to go on further. We 
have a big job but it is a mighty inter- 
esting job. We get discouraged some- 
times, but after all it is such a big 
fight, such an interesting fight, such a 
glorious fight, that I could not do any- 
thing else but want to be in it. I want 
to do my part, at least, because I know 
that what this Association stands for 
and is working for will some day come 
to pass. The Negro fighting for his 
citizenship rights knows, as far as the 
human mind is capable of knowing a 
thing, that he is right. He has right 
on his side and he has his enemy at a 
great disadvantage in that respect. And 
so we are going to win. We cannot 
help but win. As I said a moment 
ago, if we do not win, Democracy fails 
with us.

The Browsing Reader 


(From page 228) issue Benjamin 
Brawley discusses “Recent Literature 
on the Negro”. He gives his opinion 
of twelve books which have been pub- 
lished within the last year and con- 
cludes that in most cases recent con- 
tributions to the Negro literary era 
have been overpraised. He regards 
“Porgy”, “Lonesome Road” and 
“Nigger Heaven” as collectively im- 
portant because they are portrayals of 
Negro life by those who look at it 
from the outside. He makes the ad- 
mirable comment, however, that “Nig- 
ger Heaven” is not an adequate image 
of Harlem. Mr. Brawley says that 
“Tropic Death” is the most important 
recent contribution made by a Negro 
because of its freshness of material and 
because of its strong artistic style. 

The July number carries a short 
story by Elizabeth Johnston, entitled 
“A Portuguese Gentleman’. It is a 
vivid account of the delicate pretenses 
of a colored man who has the audacity 
to “pass” in his own home town in 
spite of the general knowledge of the 
identity of his colored mother and 
white father. His artifices are gently 
tolerated until, fast in the clutches of 
senility, he makes a harmless remark 
about white women. The resultant Ku 
Klux Klan demonstration terminates 
in the death of “The Portuguese 
Gentleman” and his white brother who 
attempts to save his life. 

In the same issue, Charles F. Pekor 
gives a new interpretation of “The 
Pot and the Kettle”. The article, 
written in a clear crisp style, claims 
that intolerance is not only a typical 
attitude of the South but that it is, to 
a greater or lesser degree, the attitude 
of the entire country. Manhattan, he

An editorial in the New Republic 
for July 20 says: “The Mississippi 
flood of 1927 never received from the 
daily press the attention its magnitude 
deserved; and a few weeks ago the 
transatlantic flights crowded it out of 
the news almost entirely. Probably 
most persons have comfortably assumed 
that, with the waters receding and the 
refugees being returned to their homes, 
the worst is now over. This is, of 
course, true, so far as immediate physi- 
cal peril is concerned; but it is far 
from being true in regard to the eco- 
nomic plight of the victims.” And on 
top of this, we learn from a group of 
flood vignettes by Walter White in 
New Masses for July that eighty per- 
cent of the victims are Negroes! Cen- 
tury for July carries quite the most 
colorful flood sketch we have found. 
Lyle Saxon shoves us “Down on the 
Levee” in such a forceful manner that 
we can’t help but feel the stark tragedy 
of those thousands of homeless black 
souls. 

Bruno Lasker discusses ‘Race and 
Job” in The Woman’s Press for July. 
Negroes are competitors for a wage 
which will enable them to live a stand- 
ard American life. Mr. Lasker be- 
lieves that the most intelligent approach 
to the Negro industrial problem is an 
educational one which deals with each 
single phase of the problem rather than 
one which establishes — hypothetical © 
dogmas. 

An anonymous article in The Living 
Age for July 15 says that “China’s 
Economic Future” is particularly rosy. 
After the period of transition directly 
following the present Chinese revolu- 
tion, it is expected that the world will 
be richer by a great unpenetrated field 
of production. 

The native problems of Africa are 
becoming the most popular subject of 
English periodicals. Round Table for 
June discusses ““The New Problem of 
Africa”. Gold and diamond mining 
have ceased to occupy the center of the 
economic stage and -the native prob- 
lems have become the major preoccupa- 
tion of the people. White men are 
making an attempt to create a new land 
for white settlement stretching from 
the equator to the South African 
coast; but the article concludes that: 
“The future of the highlands, both 
from the point of view of the white 
colonists and the native inhabitants, 
must be looked at and, as far as pos- 
sible, handled as a single whole.” 

“Confessions of an Unwilling 
Nordic’, a series of “mistaken identity” 
vignettes by Rayford Logan, appears 
in The World Tomorrow for July. 
Mr. Logan proves himself a diverting 
story teller in this group of sketches. 

The same issue carries an Arna 
Bontemps poem, “A Black Man Tells 
of Reaping”. We quote the last 
stanza:

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
OF AN 
EX-COLOURED 
MAN 


By James Weldon Johnson 


With an Introduction by Carl Van Vechten 


A rare, much-sought source-book about Negro 
life in America, first published anonymously in 
1912, and at length made really accessible. In its 
account of inter-racial‘ contacts, especially in the 
South, it is still probably the wisest, most re- 
strained, and most comprehensive thing on its 
subject. There are passages which, once read, can 
never be forgotten—notably, among others, that 
on a lynching in the South. In short, here is a 
novel which is not fiction—and which is, by any

THE WEARY BLUES 


FINE CLOTHES TO THE JEW 
By Langston Hughes 


Two volumes of poems that belong most poign- 
antly to the race. Others appreciate them as lit- 
erature, and realize that they are good. But the 
Negro himself knows that their substance is his 
very birthright.

“Yet what I’ve sown and what the 

orchard yields, 

My brother’s sons 

stalk and root, 

Small wonder 

glean in fields, 

They have not sown and feed on 

bitter root.” 

Rudolph Fisher, in his own inimi- 
table manner, tells us how the “Cauca- 
sian Storms Harlem” in the American 
Mercury for August. It is a com- 
parison of the cabarets of up town New 
York in their hey-day of glowing 
blackness with the present Nordic dom- 
ination with Negroes grotesquely out 
of place within the bounds of their 
own opaque community.

(From page 229) headed by Miss Flor-

critics and audiences to an extent rarely 
equalled, and, at all events within my 
memory of London shows, which goes 
back over 30 years, never surpassed. Sing- 
ing, dancing and instrumental items make 
up the programme. The “Morning Post” 
critic, one of the ablest and most inde- 
pendent of the fraternity, says in his re- 
view of the performance:—“This is, I 
should say, the «everest collection of 
entertainers to b: ‘sund anywhere. Sheer 
merit and ability are responsible for the 
inclusion in ‘blackbirds’ of all who ap- 
pear. The chorus-girls can dance with

a skill and vivacity that make all other 
dancing seem merely languid shuffling. 
The dancing of the principals is marvel- 
lous, and I am using the word deliberate- 
ly. No other word seems adequate.” 


The Far Horizon 


(From page 238) watched to see what 
sort of impression they were making. Be- 
fore the final salvo a “Professor” Mac- 
donald, with a face as black as my hat and 
a soul a good deal whiter than my own, 
spoke for three-quarters of an hour—of 
all subjects under the sun—on Ireland. 
But it was one of the best lectures on 
my country I had ever heard, as it ‘was 
one of my biggest surprises. 

An audience to which I spoke in a 
North Carolina Negro college showed 
itself almost pathetically eager to learn 
the facts of the great outside world. 
Everywhere I want I found the Negro 
anxious to “raise himself.” 

The Negroes loved to hear about 
fairies and magic. And if any Irish 
phantasist cares to carry his “cluri- 
caunes” and “good people” down to the 
Carolinas, he will find the most\jnterest- 
ed audience on this planet. 

One thing that astonished me much 
among my black friends was their keen 
desire to know something of economics: 
this was particularly true of places like 
the Harlem district of New York. And 
everywhere they asked questions.

An incident occurred in the class in 
Educational Publicity at Columbia today 
which I think our people should know. 
This is a course made up of City Super- 
intendents, college deans, etc., and num- 
bers about one hundred and fifty persons. 
It is conducted by Professor B. G. Rey- 
nolds who is Provost of Columbia and 
an authority on publicity. 

Yesterday as illustrative of imagery 
he read “The Hunter” from Olive 
Schreiner’s “Dreams” and said “I have 
another book here ‘you should own, 
‘God’s ‘Trombones.’ ” 

Today he opened class with remarks 
like this: I called your attention yester- 
day to “God’s Trombones.” I am going 
to read you two selections which are as 
fine examples of imagery as I know. 
The poems aren’t humorous and they 
aren’t dialect, but I know nothing more 
beautiful. He then read in their entirety 
“Creation” and “Go .Down Death.” 
Finishing the reading, Dr. Reynolds 
said: “One of the Negro’s chief con- 
tributions to our national life is his 
imaginative creations: Mr. Johnson is 
himself a Negro. Anyone who can pro- 
duce a book like that cannot be denied 
consideration.”

THE FINE ART OF LYING 


LETTER was written May 24, 

1927 to the Chairman of the 
Memorial Day Parade Committee, 
Jamaica, New York: 


At a meeting of the Jamaica Branch 
ot the National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People held on 
Tuesday evening, May 24, it was brought 
to the attention of the organization that 
permission had been granted to the Ku 
Klux Klan to participate in the Me- 
morial Day Parade. 

As American citizens standing for law 
and order, we do hereby protest against 
such permission being granted to an or- 
ganization advocating mob rule and 
prejudice against other citizens because 
of color, race or creed. 


The following answer was sent to 
the branch July 1: 


I am enclosing herein a detailed ex- 
position of the “Principles and Purposes” 
of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, as 
compiled by the Major Emmitt D. Smith 
Klan No. 38 of Jamaica. The reason 
for enclosing this is to enlighten you 
fully, nggonly for the purpose of ac- 
cust yu with the attitude of our 
Nati Organization, but particularly 
that of the Organization located in Ja- 
maica which participated in the Memo- 
rial Day Parade on May 30, 1927. Our 
organization is in no wise antagonistic 
toward the Negro, his aims, and his 
ideals. Contrary to popular belief, we 
are in no sense anti-Negro, and we do

not advocate mob rule and prejudice 
against other American citizens because 
of color, race or creed. We most cer- 
tainly do not believe in violating laws. 
We believe thoroughly in the Biblical 
statement that “All men are created 
equal.” We are, however, a Pro- 
organization, chiefly pro-Protestant and 
pro-American. 


The Major Emmitt D. Smith Klan 
No. 38 of Jamaica, is composed of sev- 
eral thousand Americans, amongst whom 
are most of our prominent and influen- 
tial business and professional men. We 
will welcome an opportunity of assisting 
your Protestant Churches here in Ja- 
maica, not only in a financial way, but 
also for the purpose of-telling your peo- 
ple the truth with respect to our atti- 
tude and giving them concrete proof of 
our friendliness toward them. We stand 
unequivocally upon the Constitution, and 
we believe in freedom of speech, freedom 
of the press, free public schools, separa- 
tion of Church and State, with liberty 
and equal justice for all. 


The reason for sending you this letter 
is because we have been advised that you 
are laboring under the impression that 
we are decidedly antagonistic toward 
your people, whereas the contrary is 
most certainly the case. 

Awaiting the pleasure of a communi- 
cation from you and assuring you of our 
sincerity of purpose, allow me Sir to re-

EXALTED CYCLOPS 


Meantime a leaflet on “The Negro 
Situation” is being distributed by the 
ten thousands all over the South: 

The United States of America was 
founded by the white man and it is his 
by the Grace of God and by virtue of 
the blood of our heroic dead! Notwith- 
standing the power and the money and 
the influence of those forces of evil and 
of ruin which are steadily working to 
undermine our civilization and to make 
of us a nation of mongrels, the Knights 
of the Ku Klux Klan proclaims to all 
America—T HEY SHALL NOT 
PASS! 

The man who does not believe in the 
supremacy of the white man should get 
out of America! 

To preserve America and to save 
Americans from mongrelization, the 
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has openly 
sponsored and is demanding the passage 
of laws in every state in the union mak- 
ing it a felony for a Negro to marry a 
white person. . . . , 

The Ku Klux Klan does not fight the 
Negro so long as he does not try to force 
himself upon us as our social equal. He 
must be brought again to realize he is 
of an inferior race and of a lower stand- 
ard. We teach the white man it is his 
duty as a member of a dominant race to 
keep the Negro in his own racial sphere. 

The Klan Kourier Magazine says 
editorially in the May number, which 
sent “fully 100,000 copies” to minis- 
ters in the North and East: 

The Klan believes white Americans

can be trusted. The Klan is also friend: 
ly to the Negro (let those laugh at this 
who are hopelessly unreasonable). The 
Klan believes in the Constitution of the 
United States, but the Klan also believes 
that there are certain elements entering 
into this Negro problem which were 
not in the minds of the framers of the 
Constitution, and which, therefore, are 
not to be presumptuously read into it. 

That which is stated in the Constitu- 
tion, is automatically settled by that 
Document itself. That which is ex- 
traneous, is to be settled by the cus- 
toms, manners, and usual good sense of 
our people. When all is said, we must 
still contend that this is a white man’s 
country. 

EUGENE CHEN 

One of the outstanding figures in the 
civil war now raging in China 
Eugene Chen, the Prime Minister and 
spokesman for the Cantonese or Na 
tionalist faction. According to a news 
item appearing in the New York San 
of Feb. 12, and reprinted from the 
London Daily Mail, Chen was born in 
Trinidad, B. W. I., and he is of pure 
Chinese descent. He became a solici- 
tor of the Supreme Court of Trinidad 
and Tobago, which information solves 
the mystery why the newspaper corre 
spondents in South China have been 
unable to account for Chen’s perieg 
English, also, his familiarity wit 
French literature and politics. : 

A portion of the London article 
reads as follows: 

“Eugene Chen married a charming 
colored creole of Port of Spain, by whom 
he has two daughters and a son. They 
have divided their time between Port of 
Spain and London, taking the name of 
Acham-Chen. The wife died not very 
long ago in Port of Spain, where the only 
son, Percy Acham-Chen, is practicing at 
the Trinidad bar and is a very clever 
Rugby halfback. ; 

“The -daughters are accomplished 
dancers—one is a genius—and have ap 
peared on the London stage but now 
confine their efforts to appearing for 
Port of Spain charities.” ;
