OUR ADVICE FOR 1929 IS: 
BUY MORE LIFE INSURANCE 


Unlike some other great men, we have not been asked to contribute our prophecy on condi- 
tions in 1929. We give it any way, and pay for space to have it printed. 


The American People should buy more Life Insurance in 1929 than ever before. Especially 
should colored Americans, because we need it more; we understand more about its uses each 
year, and there are more of us with money to pay for it each year. 


Our interest in this subject is not entirely academic. Buy more Life Insurance because we have it to sell. Our 
business increased more than fifty per cent. in 1928. If it increased several thousand per cent, in 1929, we 
would not then have supplied all the Life Insurance that colored Americans need, and can pay for. Hundreds 
of our policyholders have reached their limit with us now. We urge them to continue to buy more; to add to 
their insurance policies from any reputable company that will supply their needs; especially from the legal 
reserve life insurance companies, owned and managed by colored people. 


The man or woman who buys more life insurance is the one who has already bought from us or from some 
other company. Such a person can better understand the idea of adding to, of accumulating something worth 
while for himself and for a generation that must have financial resources far in excess of our own. Our policies 
are good but they are not offered as substitutes for the policies of any other company. We try to give our policy- 
holders something they never had before. Any one of the twelve thousand can tell you what that is. We can tell 
you if you mail us the attached coupon. An attractive calendar goes with the telling—without obligation to you.

holiday in Rome. It is evening. 
There is a pyre of wood and tinder, 
with a high flat top, and gathered in a 
circle around it are thousands of Ro- 
mans and their friends from Lombardy. 
On top of this pyre a man lies “hog- 
tied” (his forearms bound tightly to 
his legs.) It resembles the setting for 
a religious sacrifice until one comes 
near enough to hear the curses of the 
assembled multitude and their shouts 
for the blood and torture of the vic- 
tim. But the leaders do not hurry; 
all seem to be whetting their appetites 
on the spectacle. Electric lights from 
various machines are turned upon the 
victim, and cans and buckets of gaso- 
line are gathered near the still un- 
lighted pyre—You had not heard that 
there were automobiles, electric lights 
and gasoline in Rome in the time B. C. 
But this is Rome, Mississippi, a few 
score miles northwest of Jackson and 
just beyond the little town of Lom- 
bardy. The time is December 31, 
1928,—-which is long ‘“‘before Christ” 
in Mississippi. 

But before we observe how the Ro- 
mans will carry forward this particu- 
lar celebration, let us review what has 
led up to it. Mississippi is a “former 
slave state”; that is, slavery was sup- 
posed to be abolished there with the 
ratification of the 13th amendment to 
the American Constitution. But no 
human institution is ever so abruptly 
discontinued as that; rather has the 
system of slavery gone through various 
stages of evolution—from private to 
public slavery, from individual own- 
ership to community ownership of 
the enslaved class. When the so- 
called “freedmen” have got into the 
toils of the law, even for misdemeanors, 
they have sometimes been sold for a 
term of years by the state to private 
persons or corporations, to work out 
their fines under a “convict lease sys- 
tem”. Today there are “state farms” 
of black convict labor, like those of 
northwest Mississippi, near Rome and 
Lombardy. These public - property 
slaves are treated worse than the old 
private-property slaves, for these wear 
the added brand of crime and those 
who profit by their labor have not the 
economic restraint of permanent pro- 
prietary interest. 


[i is a date “B. C.”, and there is a 


N camp number 11 was Charley 
Sheppard, a stalwart black, serving 
for murder. He had probably killed 
another Negro or he would have been 
executed. He was a “trusty”, a ser-

March, 1929 











A Roman Holiday 


By WILLIAM PICKENS 


Madame Naidu, friend of 
Gandhi, and like him once Presi- 
dent of the Indian National Con- 
gress, asked an assembly of Amer- 
icans the other day: “Is it true 


that they really burn colored peo- 


ple in the United States?” This 
story, which gathers its facts from 
local white newspapers, is the an- 
swer to that query. 


camps. He was in the immediate cus- 
tody of Sergeant J. D. Duvall. 
“Trusties” are permitted to go about 
within prescribed limits without a 
guard. Once Sheppard overstayed his 
time a bit, and Duvall gave him a 
brutal beating. Mississippi prisoners 
are at the mercy of the whims and 
passions of their keepers. At night the 
abused convict called Duvall out of his 
bed to the door and knocked him in the 
head with a hammer, killing him, per- 
haps instantly. Then the convict, es- 
caping, is said to have abducted a young 
woman, Duvall’s daughter. This is 
strange, since he and Miss Duvall had 
to walk the entire length of the farm, 
past many camps where guards were 
on duty. We will never know the con- 
vict’s side of this story. Perhaps he 
took her as hostage. He returned her 
after 24 hours, and it is said that he 
had assaulted her. In the South any 
force or duress exercised by a black 
man against a white woman is regarded 
as criminal assault. Even accidental 
collisions on the sidewalks have been 
so regarded. A Jackson daily paper 
says that the Negro claimed that the 
young woman asked him “to take her 
away” after her father was killed. 
Then there was the great man-hunt, 
lasting more than two days: men, guns, 
dogs. But the camp “blood hounds” 
failed to keep track and overtake Shep- 
pard. On Monday morning, Decem- 
ber 31st, he turned up in a cabin on 
the farm owned and operated by Miss 
Laura Mae Keeler, a white woman, 
where his brother Tom worked. White 
women of the South, who know col- 
ored people, are less afraid of colored 
men than any other white women in 
the world. The terror supposed to 
seize such women in the presence of 
black men is a myth, born of the mor- 
bid minds of those who, without ex- 
perience, believe what they read, or 
what is deliberately manufactured by 
those who seek to justify lynching. 


HEN Miss Keeler heard that 
Charley was being hunted, she 
took Tom from the cabins into her own 
house for safe-keeping, for she knew 


that the Mississippi mob code is to kill 
even those who are akin to the object 
of its wrath. The fugitive sent a re- 
quest to her house to see his brother 
Tom. Miss Keeler phoned the news 
to a nearby town and soon a former 
deputy sheriff and other armed men 
appeared. They did not rush the cabin 
where Charley sat on a bed with a gun 
beside him, presumably with the tem- 
per of a wild beast,—desperate, hun- 
gry, wet and ragged, from a 48-hour 
chase through swamps and _ streams. 
The hunters conferred with Miss Kee- 
ler. She advised them to let her go 
alone and talk with Charley. They 
took the advice. Unarmed and alone 
she went to the cabin and talked with 
the convict, who expressed a desire to 
“Shoot it out” with his pursuers. By a 
show of human kindness she persuaded 
him to put himself under her protec- 
tion, promising to conduct him per- 
sonally to the authorities. He agreed 
to capitulate under those terms. It 
should be explained that Charley Shep- 
pard was a half-wit. In his situation 
only a Negro half-wit could have a 
faith in such promises in Mississippi. 
But Miss Keeler was sincere, and with 
the armed men she secured a car and 
they drove for four hours through high- 
ways and by-ways. She says she did 
her best to dodge the mobs and reach 
a safe jail. But somehow just after 
they had passed through the little town 
of Cleveland and gotten conveniently 
outside of it, they ran head-on into the 
biggest of all the gathering mobs, the 
one led by one of the Duvall brothers, 
who “politely but firmly” demanded 
and took the captiye. 

And Governor Bilbo? One of his 
“generals” called out the militia, 400 
strong, to help run down the fugitive 
Negro. They invaded the swamps 
where the convict was suspected of hid- 
ing,—but had other Negro convicts to 
walk ahead of the soldiers, presumably 
to make a path for the troops. After 
this convict vanguard made sure that 
Sheppard was not there, the soldiers 
would enter and throw deadly or 
asphyxiating gas bombs into all hollow 
trees and stumps. As soon as word 
came that a mob had the Negro a few 
miles away, this army was disbanded 
and sent home, the “general” remark- 
ing, frankly enough, that they had 
come out to help catch the Negro and 
not to take him from a mob. The re- 
porter of the Jackson Daily News, who 
was with the mob at the time, says that 
six car-loads of militiamen passed right 
by a string of mob cars, in one of which 
the Negro was held captive, and did 


79 








not even stop to investigate. After 
the chase started, the Governor went 
off to Tennessee to visit his son in 
school, and returned just in time to 
hear the news of the cremation and to 
view the remains next day. When 
asked what he would do, he said that 
he had neither the time nor the money, 
and indicated that he also lacked the 
inclination, “to investigate 3,000 peo- 
ple”. To a flood of telegrams from all 
over the nation, the explanation was 
“he is out of the city”, and a local 
newspaper further apologized that no 
answers could be given anyhow, “since 
it is quite evident that there is nothing 
the governor can do about it”. 


UT let us follow the mob. An 

ex-deputy sheriff who rode with 
Miss Keeler and talked to the convict 
for the four hours before they met the 
mob, declares that Sheppard was 
“crazy” and a plain “half-wit”. Per- 
haps he should have been in a mental 
hospital instead of a convict camp. But 
what does the mob care? The mob is 
also crazy. A few years ago a Georgia 
mob took a raving Negro maniac right 
out of ‘an insane asylum and lynched 
him. So this Mississippi mo! began its 
great parade of seven hours. It grew 
to 3,000 automobiles and at least 6,000 
people. It went advertising all over 
the countryside, through towns and vil- 
lages, drumming up a crowd by ex- 
hibiting the Negro and forecasting the 
performance of the coming night. It 
halted at the camps and communities 
of Negro people to bully them, threat- 
ening them with the awful impending 
fate which was overtaking Sheppard. 
One hundred white women joined this 
procession and stayed through the last 
orgies of the night. 

At 7:30 the procession halted at 
Lombardy and staged a sort of recep- 
tion and review, prelude to the main 
show to be enacted later in Rome. The 
Negro was placed on a raised platform 
in front of the May Brothers’ store in 
Lombardy, lights were played on him, 
and the mob and the public marched 
by to get a close-up of the victim. The 
mgb had claimed that two other Ne- 
groes were implicated. Here on this 
solemn eminence Sheppard denied that, 
fortunately for those others. 

The sacrifice having been inspected, 
the procession reformed and moved 
on to Rome, taking up final posi- 
tion in front of camp number 11. 
Mobs have a sentiment for en- 
acting their horror on the spot 
of the crime which they are supposed 
to be “avenging”,—to cover a lesser 
crime with a greater. The filling sta- 
tions of that section did a land-office 
business, being drained of gasoline for 
the unheard-of number of cars, or to 


80 


fill the tin cans and other containers in 
preparation for the cremation. The 
mob was leisurely; it set the stage; it 
even waited on some late-comers, rela- 
tives and friends of Duvall, who were 
to have seats of honor at the pyre-side. 


O the great pyre stood under the 

night, laden with its human victim 
but not yet lighted. There was a great 
multitude of farmers and denizens of 
swamps and hills, who lead a rather 
dull everyday life and had never before 
participated in so thrilling a spectacle. 
When the black half-wit realized what 
was prepared for him, he put up a ter- 
rible fight. One against thousands, he 
struck out until his hands were securely 
tied; then he cursed and swore and 
railed at the mob,—a madman express- 
ing contempt for their “civilization”. 
Even when his pyre was lighted, he 
grasped and hurled burning sticks of 
wood at the leaders of the mob. Be- 
fore the torch was applied, a member 
of the mob jumped upon the pyre, 
straddled the bound Negro and was 
cutting off his ears with a penknife. 
The prostrate black spat up into the 
torturer’s face. 

The final act begins. They pour a 
bit of gasoline on his legs first and light 
them. They wanted the torture to last 
and they boast that they kept him liv- 
ing in the fire for at least forty-five 
minutes. He continued to fight; once, 
all ablaze, he managed to roll off the 
pyre and was struggling to his feet on 
the ground. Some, frightened, were 
about to shoot, but the leaders said 
shooting would be too merciful and 
several seized him and threw him back 
upon the pyre. But his animal cour- 
age had angered them and now they 
poured on a great flood of gasoline and 
a column of blaze rose up. The grand 
climax. The head and limbs dropped 
away first. The trunk was slower to 
disintegrate. The fire burned out. 

The show was over. Then one be- 
gins to wonder to what order of the 
animal kingdom man really belongs. 
The mob rushed forward to secure sou- 
venirs of charred flesh and bones. The 
smell of burning flesh is very disagree- 
able, but the members and pieces of 
this Negro were quickly appropriated. 
The head was seized while still smok- 
ing and fuming. But next morning 
by the side of the various roads along 
which the members of the scattering 
mob had returned home, the abducted 
parts of the Negro’s body were found 
thrown into ditches and gulleys,—the 
head here, and a hand or a foot or a fe- 
mur there. Some think that this was due 
to the disagreeable smell of burned 
flesh, but we suspect that it was indic- 
ative of returning human sense, as the 
people scattered away from their place 
of saturnalia. Only a mob could do 








what had been done. One cannot be a 
mob by himself. The mob-mind ceases 
to exist when one finds himself away 
from the crowd, alone on a country 
road, with a grinning human skull or 
a mutilated foot or tibia in his auto- 
mobile. Mob caste-pressure is no long- 
er felt,—the beastly souvenir js 
thrown into the nearest ditch. They 
say that the fellow who cut away the 
unburned ears, was still exhibiting 
them at a distant filling station next 
morning, but we venture the guess 
that he did not keep them long past 
his dinner. 

So it happened. Everybody knew it. 
The papers gave the details. Every 
item of fact which we have given here, 
was taken from the accounts of those 
who were rather in sympathy with the 
mob. We have taken not a single item 
from a Negro source. But the next day 
the coroner, after viewing the pyre- 
place and the rediscovered pieces of the 
Negro, rendered this official verdict: 
“Death from unknown causes”. That 
is, “officially” nobody knows who killed 
that Negro, albeit thousands were at 
the killing, perhaps even the coroner, 
or his relatives and friends. 

This mob crime was distressingly 
deliberate. We boast of fewest lynch- 
ings in 1928, but this last one was more 
studiedly savage than anything since 
Henry Lowry was “burned by inches” 
in Arkansas, near Memphis, about 
eight years ago. Those inclined to con- 
done mobs on the ground that they 
lack self-control and are driven by 
frenzy and madness should modify 
their opinion in the face of this ex- 
ample. This mob was highly appraised 
by a Mississippi newspaper for being 
so “methodical”. It drummed for a 
crowd, it set its stage, like a show busi- 
ness. It took time, it paraded seven 
hours, it waited for night when fire- 
works are more impressive. It mounted 
its victim on a raised platform and 
turned spotlights on him. It waited on 
important guests and arranged choice 
seats for them, near the head of the 
Negro’s pyre. It sent out committees 
and emissaries to buy or to “com- 
mandeer” gasoline and wood. To make 
the show last, it burned the victim by 
degrees, beginning on the legs; before 
lighting him, it stuffed mud into the 
Negro’s mouth and nostrils, partly clos- 
ing them, for fear that carbon monoxide 
or other deadly gases generated in the 
first combustion, might be drawn into 
his lungs—and take the thrill out of 
the remaining part of the show. The 
procedure was devilishly systematic. It 
carried the crowd and got them s0 
thoroughly hypnotized that many of 
them wanted a piece of that Negro 
when the show was over. Its members

Football in Negro Colleges in 1928

Drew of Bluefield, End 


ELECTING players for all Negro 

American Teams this year was no 
easy task. Many teams brought forth 
dependable backs, brilliant ball carriers, 
passers, pass receivers and_ punters. 
Clark had so many backfield stars that 
it was dubbed “the team with a thou- 
sand backs”. Bluefield, Howard, Wil- 
berforce, Atlanta, Fisk, Tuskegee, 
West Virginia, Wiley, Alabama State, 
Prairie View and Alcorn developed 
backfield men who gave good accounts

of themselves every week-end. Back- 
field stars were numerous, but good 
linemen were scarce, and a good line is 
half of the gridiron battle. 

An end must be fast and brainy. 
Drew and Fowler possess these quali- 
ties in full measure. Drew’s playing 
was brilliant and he made many of 
Bluefield’s touchdowns. In Gallion 
and Thomas tackles are found who 
know what the enemy will do after the 
game has been in progress but a few 
minutes. Charging fast and low, they 
strike with terrific’ force, smashing 
everything before them. Cunningham 
was the outstanding guard of 1928. 
He played both guard and tackle, win- 
ning the respect of all opponents and 
the praise of sport critics who saw him 


in action. Bates was the best guard in 
the Texas Conference and one of the 
most dependable linemen in the coun- 
try. Benson, a_ roving hard-hitter, 
stands out the cleverest center of the 
season. The enemy could not pass 
through him and as a passer-back, he 
was steady, sure and reliable. 


HE backfield of the first team is 
made up of Stanley, Harding, 
Coles and Jones, all outstanding per- 
tormers. Stanley outplayed, outfought 
and outgeneraled all quarter backs 
against whom he played. In the games

with Howard and Tuskegee, Stanley 
showed up excellently, outguessing both 
Payne and Smith. His strategy de- 
served victory, but the fates decreed 
otherwise and Howard and Tuskegee 
won. Harding was the greatest back 
of 1928. He played both half and 
quarter on Wiley’s team and made 
good in both positions. Coles did well 
everything he was asked to do. Strong, 
fast and cool-headed, he is a dangerous 
runner, and he seldom fails to make the 
yardage needed to carry the ball for- 
ward. Jones, able, strong and speedy, 
was the best full back in the game. His 
line hitting antics bothered all oppos- 
ing teams. Complete master of him- 
self, he puts every ounce of his great 
bulk into every movement. He is one 
of the greatest full backs of many years.

Stevenson, Tuskegee’s star back, did 
not play as brilliantly as in preceding 
years, but periodically performed well 
at running, passing and_ snatching 
passes out of the air. He is not given 
a place on any team because he has 
played college football for more than 
four years. Cain, of Bluefield, would 
doubtless have gained the quarter back 
berth on the first team had he not been 
forced out of the game by an injury. 
Buford, who took his place, did excel- 
lent work. 

Wiggins and McPherson (Atlanta), 
Ross and Marshall (Howard), Lane 
and Coleman (North Carolina A. and 
T.), Joyner, Shanklin and V. Smith 
(Tuskegee), Marks (Prairie View) 
Wiggins and Graves (Bluefield), 
Ward, Tynes and Mitchell (Wilber- 
force), Yost and Thornhill (Fisk), 
Crisp and Anderson (Oklahoma), Mc- 
Connell and Edwards (West Vir- 
ginia), Davis (Virginia Seminary and 
College), Tyler (Morris Brown), 
Wilson (Texas), Henderson (Bishop), 
Dupree and Johnson (Clark), Weems 
and Melton (Straight), and Lewis 
(Alabama State) made excellent rec- 
ords as backfield players. The linemen 
named on the second and third teams 
were good performers. 


HOSE who have watched the 

progress of foot ball in Negro col- 
leges know that the last five years have 
witnessed a growth of interest in the 
game that has few parallels in sport his- 
tory. Negro college foot bal] in 1928 
attained .a stature greater than ever 
known and proficient teams were de- 
veloped in every section of the country. 


Many intersectional games were 
played in 1928. Wilberforce matched 
wits with Knoxville and Virginia 
Union at Wilberforce, and played 
Tuskegee and Fisk at Nashville. West 
Virginia entertained Lincoln, Mo., 
and Hampton at Charleston, W. Va., 
and sent them home tagged with de- 
feat. Tuskegee journeyed to North 
Carolina and played a 7—7 tie with 
North Carolina A. and T. Bluefield 
crushed Morehouse at Columbus, 
Ohio, winning 40—O0. An interesting 
match was played at Montgomery, 
Ala., between Oklahoma and Alabama 
State, Oklahoma triumphing 7—O. 
Howard downed Livingstone in North 
Carolina, Atlanta in Georgia and Fisk 
in Washington, D. C., and staged a 
drawn contest, 0—0, with Bluefield in 
West Virginia. Wiley and Oklahoma 
played a 7—7 tie at Dallas, Texas, and 
Atlanta won from Prairie View at 
Houston, Texas, on New Year’s Day, 
7—0. 

Bluefield stands out as one of the 
champions of Negro college foot ball in 
1928. It repeated its performance of

1927 by defeating all rivals but one,

In 1927 it was Wilberforce that tied

THE N.A.A.C P. BATTLE FRONT 


% 


A 20TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR 
HEN the members and friends 
of the National Association for 

the Advancement of Colored People 

convene in Cleveland next June, for 
the Annual Conference of the Asso- 
ciation, they will be celebrating the 
20th Anniversary of what is now the 
oldest body in America since the Civil 

War, fighting for the civil status of 

the Negro as a United States citizen. 

The growth of the Association from 
a small committee, called together at 
the time of the terrible riots in Spring- 
field, Illinois, Lincoln’s home, is dra- 
matic and inspiring. Three hundred 
and fifty branches in forty-four states 
and individual members to the number 
of 100,000 of beth races are now united 
upon a common program. And it is 
in the record of the Association that 
with a pitifully insignificant expendi- 
ture of money, many decisive and far- 
reaching steps have been taken toward 
the achievement of its aims. 

The Association began with appeals 
to law enforcement authorities and to 
public sentiment, for a minimum of de- 
cency and human justice. It devel- 
oped into a fact-finding instrument 
whose investigators penetrated the 
scenes of desperate cruelty and injustice 
and, often at risk of their lives, gave 
the facts of the American Negro’s situ- 
ation to the civilized world. It en- 
listed in its cause a number of the most 
prominent and the ablest attorneys in 
the country, including its venerable 
President, Moorfield Storey, and of 
late years, the celebrated authority on 
constitutional law, Louis Marshall, and 
the outstanding criminal lawyer and 
humanitarian, Clarence Darrow. 


ES propaganda, its marshalling of 
an enlightened public sentiment in 
defence of the Negro’s rights, have been 
in no wise diminished in recent years. 
But accompanying these, has been a 
battery of legal victories which estab- 
lish the foundations upon which Ne- 
groes everywhere may take their stand. 
Five decisive victories before the 
United States Supreme Court stand to 
the credit of the N. A. A. C. P. and 
the principles established are vital not 
to the Negro alone, but to every United 
States citizen solicitous that the ideals 
upon which the democratic experiment 
is founded be realized. 

These victories and the other work 
of the Association have been achieved 
with startling economy. Had there not

This is the 20th Anniversary 
Year of the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored 
People, and everybody who appre- 
ciates its work should join in the 
celebration. . 





been celebrated counsel willing to give 
their services, anyone of the important 
legal victories won by the Association 
might easily have cost more than the 
Association spent upon its entire work 
during one or even two years. 

It is hardly necessary to rehearse 
these victories and their significance. 
A brief reference to each will suffice to 
call it to mind. There is first of all 
the celebrated Louisville Segregation 
case, forever outlawing residential 
segregation by state or city enactment 
in America. There is the deadly blow 
delivered at peonage in the Arkansas 
Peonage cases, carried before the Su- 
preme Courts of Arkansas and the 
United States, by which colored farm- 
ers were freed of death sentences and 
long imprisonment and the facts of 
the debt slavery system made known 
to the world. There was the Louisiana 
segregation case, reafirming the prin- 
ciples established by the Louisville 
case. There was the Texas White 
Primary case, a blow struck at the dis- 
franchisement of colored Americans in 
the South, following the N. A. A.C. P. 
participation in the epoch-making 
Grandfather Clause case. 





Nominations Asked 
For Spingarn Medal 


The highest honor bestowed an- 
nually upon an American citizen 
of African descent, awaits further 
nominations. The N. A. A. C. P. 
announces that further nominations 
for the award of the medal this 
year are invited. The medal will 
be presented in Cleveland this 
June, at the 20th Annual Confer- 
ence of the N. A. A. C. P. Nomi- 
nations should be addressed to 
Bishop John Hurst, Chairman 
Spingarn Medal Award Commit- 
tee, N. A. A. C. P., 69 Fifth Ave- 
nue, New York City. Nomina- 
tions should name. the specific 
achievement or lifework on the 
basis of which the award is recom- 
mended, and should be accompanied 
by brief life history of the nomi- 
nee. 





De 


In almost all of the work it has un- 
dertaken, the N. A. A. C. P. has been 
a pioneer, nowhere more so than in its 
campaign against lynching. First it es- 
tablished the facts and demolished the 
pretext of “the usual crime’’, as an ex- 
cuse for the barbarous practices. Then 
it went to the country, unremittingly 
and relentlessly, carrying its fight into 
the halls of the United States Congress, 
procuring the passage of the Dyer Anti- 
Lynching bill by a vote of 230 to 119, 
a measure blocked only by filibuster of 
southern senators who threatened to 
hold up the business of the nation until 
the bill was dropped. 

Other organizations have paid trib- 
ute to this pioneering of the N. A. A. 
C. P. against lynching. And it is prob- 
ably fair to say that the reduction of 
lynching figures to the unprecedentedly 
low figure of eleven for the year 1928, 
is due more to the work of this Asso- 
ciation than to any one other single 
cause. 

The Association was first, also, to 
recognize and to call public attention to 
the dangerous form of intolerance and 
bigotry made manifest in the Ku Klux 
Klan, and it fought this misguided body 
with the most deadly and the most ef- 
fective weapon at hand: pitiless pub- 
licity. 

This is to leave out of account en- 
tirely the quickening of hope and cour- 
age in many local communities, which 
the Association has been instrumental 
in bringing about. In innumerable 
cases the National Office has taken 
complete command of a contest against 
injustice. It did so in the celebrated 
Sweet case in Detroit, where eleven 
colored people, defending a home from 
mob threats and attack were subjected 
to indictment on a charge of first de- 
gree murder. It has taken command in 
many other difficult and dangerous situ- 
ations. But increasingly, its advice and 
encouragement and, often, its financial 
aid, have enabled communities of col- ° 
ored Americans to fight and to win 
their own battles, one of the latest be- 
ing the defeat of the segregation at- 
tempt in the Charleston, West Vir- 
ginia, public library. 


WENT Y annual reports of the 

Association contain only a skele- 

ton outline of the work which has been 

accomplished. Those reports are, if 

anything, understatements. They are 

brief, and months and months of labor

Negro Illness and the Nation's Health 


NYTHING that affects the Ne- 
gro today concerns the American 
nation as a whole. One-tenth of our 
total population is colored. And no 
longer is the Negro only a resident in 
the rural South. He has moved north 
in great numbers and he has gone from 
the farm to the cities both north and 
south. About one-fifth of the Negro 
population now lives in the northern 
and western states and a full third of 
this race is living in cities and towns. 
The Negro is widely distributed 
throughout the United States. His in- 
dustry, his art and music are national 
assets. His ignorance and his disease 
are liabilities and dangers not only to 
him and his group but to the entire 
country. Especially in health the in- 
terests and lives of the races are in- 
extricably woven together. © lf a mos- 
quito bites a malarial Negro, that busy 
insect is very likely next to bite you or 
your white neighbor and transmit the 
fever with no regard whatever for color 
or social caste. Hookworm disease, 
supposed to have been brought into this 
country by black slaves, has now been 
passed on almost entirely to the whites. 
A colored cook coming one morning 
to her fashionable white employer in 
Virginia was anxiously warned by the 
mistress to stop at the gate since measles 
had broken out in the manor house and 
germs might be picked up and carried 
back. ‘“That’s all right,” laughed the 
cook, “My children have been having 
measles for a month.” Disease knows 
no color line. Jim Crow laws do not 
hold for germs of measles, tubercu- 
losis, pneumonia and typhoid. 


JINDITIONS of health among 

Negroes are still far below Ameri- 
can standard. A bulletin issued in Feb- 
ruary, 1928, by the State Department 
of Public Health of Illinois gives a 
striking picture of the difference be- 
.tween Negro and white mortality. 
This bulletin reports that during the 
four-year period 1922 to 1925 for the 
entire state of Illinois the annual death 
rate among Negroes was 23.0 per thou- 
sand as contrasted with 11.2 for whites. 
In this state for the period 1922 to 
1925 the number of deaths actually ex- 
ceeded that of registered births among 
the colored people, although the aver- 
age Negro birth rate for 1925 was 22.5 
per thousand, substantially higher than 
that for the whites. Wisconsin, Kan- 
sas, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and

President of the Julius Rosenwald Fund 


We all know what Julius 
Rosenwald has done for housing 
colored schools and giving build- 
ings to colored Y. M. C. A’s. This, 
however, is but the beginning of 
his philanthropy. He is turning to 
larger matters of housing and 
health, and the author of this arti- 
cle is President of the organization 
which is launching this wider pro- 
gram. 


Michigan show shocking death rates, 
exceeding or approaching the tradition- 
ally large number of births in this 
group. 

One should not be too much alarmed 
by the conditions reported for a few 
northern states during a period known 
to be one of transition and of adjust- 
ment of large masses of Negroes to new 
and trying conditions in industrial cen- 
ters. Conditions in the South where, 
over a long number of years, the Negro 
has adjusted himself, show on the 
whole much better records both for 
sickness and death. ‘The death rate for 
Negroes throughout the entire country 
is 18.2. This is much better than the 
figures for several northern industrial 
centers, but still compares unfavorably 
with the death rate of 11.2 for whites. 

The current records of the Metro- 
politan Life Insurance Company, 
which has on its books more than two 
million Negroes, a fifth of the total 
colored population, are on the whole 
much more reassuring. These policy 
holders include men, women and chil- 
dren of all ages, working in every con- 
ceivable occupation, and living in all 
sections of the country. Dr. Louis I. 
Dublin in recent books and articles re- 
ports, from the extensive experience 
of that company, that the average death 
rate of these two million policy holders 
has declined from 17.5 per thousand in 
1911 to 14.6 in 1926. While in a sense 
the insured are a picked group, still 
the large numbers included make the 
findings significant. Dr. Dublin’s 
study indicates that Negro health has 
greatly improved during the past few 
decades, that it is in about the position 
of white health in this country thirty 
or forty years ago, and that further 
concerted and intelligent attack may be 
expected to show corresponding gains 
in years ahead. 


E must remember that death js 

not the only index of health. 
While authoritative figures that will 
show the amount of current sickness 
are almost impossible to obtain, it js 
evident that the higher death rate by no 
means tells the entire story of Negro 
health handicaps. Sickness in both mild 
and acute form is known to be much 
zreater among the colored people; in- 
capacities due to accidents, and painful 
illness and malformations due to im- 
proper medical attention are conspicu- 
ous. Illness and incapacity retard the 
race and represent a great economic 
loss to the Negro and to the nation. 

However bad conditions are in given 
localities there is no evidence that the 
group will die out or even diminish in 
number. On the other hand there is 
no likelihood that the Negro will in- 
crease at any rapid rate or begin to 
press the white man by sheer force of 
numbers. As a matter of fact, while 
the colored population of America has 
steadily increased since the first arrivals 
from Africa, it has for over a century 
quite as steadily decreased in propor- 
tion to the total population. During 
the past century the Negroes increased 
from a million and three quarters in 
1820 to about ten and a half millions 
in 1920, the latest national census. Yet 
their rate of increase has been steadily 
slowing down and, while a hundred 
years ago they numbered almost 20 
per cent of the total population, by 
1920 they were just under 10 per cent 
of the entire nation. 

The Negro, as any other group in 
the population, begins to have smaller 
families as he rises in the economic 
and social scale. Better public health 
has not brought a great onrush of popu- 
lation among the white in America and 
it will not do so among the colored. 
“Fewer and better babies” is the rule 
as prosperity, intelligence and health 
increase. 


My purpose is simply to call atten- 
tion to the problem of Negro illness 
and to its direct influence on the health 


of the nation. The answer lies in im- 
proved sanitation, good doctors and 
nurses who in increasing numbers must 
be members of the race, hospitals and 
clinics and health education, Under 
pressure of economy and time saving 
it is easy and natural to neglect or 1g- 
nore the colored people. But germs 
cannot be segregated. Democracy and

smell the open roses,

fronds for your pillow,

Life is a See-Saw 
By ANITA SCOTT COLEMAN 


IFE is a see-saw. 


Sorrow strides one end of the board 


Joy is poised upon the other. 


Sorrow rides low; 
Joy rides high. 


Joy cannot lift up sorrow 


I have ridden with sorrow low, so low. 


orrow cannot bring joy down.

Seen him weeping for a well-loved one 


March, 1929 








Who was cold and quiescent in death. 
Joy cannot lift up sorrow 
Sorrow cannot bring joy low. 

I have ridden with joy, high so high. 

I have seen a babe new born 

And heard his new born cry 

Beheld his hand no bigger than the petal 

of a flower, flutter with infant quest 

And fall to rest, with peace 

Beyond all worldliness at my own breast. 
Sorrow rides low; 
Joy rides high. 


Funeral Design 
By ISABEL MC MEEKIN 


"TRE heavy flowers are banked against 

the wall, 

And paganly enchant the stifling air, 

The Christian tapers flicker banner-tall, 

And music makes dim background to a 
prayer. 

The minister’s dull voice drones on at 
length, 

Reciting what he fancies were my ways, 

Extolling charity and virtue’s strength, 

And preaching piety of impious days. 

Some of you have come to stare and 
chatter, 

And some to sniff and idly stand about, 

Some discuss a certain money matter, 

And some express a vague religious 


doubt.

Forget the trifling things I did and said, 
Remember only, I am happy, dead. 


Dark Madonna 
By VERNE BRIGHT 
IGHT is an old Negro woman 
Hovering above her sleeping chil- 
dren... 
In an inviolable mesh 
Of dreams they lie 
Delicately tangled. 


Along their brows she draws cool hands 


Her breasts yearn 
For the hunger of their waking. 


She is a dark madonna 

Rocking the cradle of the moon— 
Her eyes are stars 

And her voice 

The wind going over . 


She whispers fabled words— 
Slow sleep-tunes to her children 
Dreaming . . 


Night is a dark madonna . 


After Drought 
By CHARLES B. JOHNSON 


"THE grass smiles up to kiss the rain, 
The earth’s dry lips are cracked 
with pain; 


Gay children in the sodden street, 


The cool drops spatter with their feet. 


My soul looks up with sudden peace 
From drops of grace His wells release, 
His children in the showers laugh, 

The while their souls the blessings quaff. 


Peace 
By MARION GREEN SCOTT 


] STROVE with desperate hands to epe 
the door, 

That barred my sight, Oh, Gracious God 
from thee, 

With futile sighs I plead to see once more 

Thy face; then silently 

The moon had birth 

And Heaven leaned down to brood with 
tenderness 

O’er quiet earth; 

And I had peace. 


I laid my‘ heart within the sepulcher, 

And anguished turned away, so blind 
with tears 

I could not see Thy hand, blest Com- 
forter, 

But only barren years; 

Then sunset’s flame 

Recorded in the sky its glowing praise 

Of Thy great name; 

And I felt peace. 

So ’mid the strife and turmoil of the 
soul, 

When torn with doubts and fears we 
cannot see. 

Thy plan which 
part to whole 

In its entirety, 

Some still small voice 

Will speak to us in starry solitude; 

Then, Soul, rejoice 

For gift of peace.

Behind him a picture. 
Blue gray skies 

Phantom clouds 

Chasing a topsy-turvy ship 
Across an indigo sea... 


And on those joyous sails 

A mirrored image of a bald head 
Shattering my dream 

Of far away, mysterious lands, 
Gold-red sunsets, 

Silver-white nights, 

Of seas shattering against 

A sun splashed deck. 


The whisper of the sea in my ears 

And the whistle of the wind in the sails 

Are replaced by the wheezy murmur 
Of an anti-Freudian.

The Little Page 


By EFFIE LEE NEWSOME 


Calendar Chat 


HIS month brings us the Easter- 

tide. Late in March wistful 
crocus flowers look up to the sky. 
Spring after spring they have turned 
upward their gold and purple faces 
from the wet: black earth. Easter’s 
flower is the lily yet Easter’s story is 
told by the crocus. It comes to life 
when all the world seems dark. It 
has buried within it light—notice the 
godlen stigmas and styles. Saffron, a 
name from the far East, brings before 
us a glowing gold and the saffron and 
crocus are one. 


The radiance of Christ’s resurrection 
is in the coming of the little saffron 
flower.

THE Crisis 














An AuTUMN Love Cyc te. Poems by 
Georgia Douglas Johnson. Venal. 
New York. 

ITHIN the last ten years, 

Georgia Douglas Johnson has, 
through her publishers, brought out 
three volumes of lyrics, most of which 
employ—next to food—the oldest 
theme in the world, and would ex- 
quisitely complement a musical setting, 
here, too, in this united estate of 

America, where it is decidedly against 

the law,—Dred Scott, Monroe Doc- 

trine, or, maybe, some unwritten cartel 
of Marque and Reprisal,—for any per- 
son of color to write of love without 
hypothecating atavistic jungle tones: 
the rumble of tom-tom, voodoo ebo, 
fetish of sagebrush and high spliced 
palm tree—all the primal universal pas- 
sions often solely associated with 

Africa,— 

Pardon, I. did intend writing 
about Mrs. Johnson’s latest book, dn 
Autumn Love Cycle, but any digres- 
sion is logical in an atmosphere where 
even an offering on the shrine of Par- 
nassus must meet the agony challenge: 
Aha! It is white. . How import- 
ant! Lo, it is black! Alas! But 
Life, the book of poetry, cannot relate 
itself to unrelated persons. Silk purses 
are no more made of sows’ ears than of 
rayon. ‘The artificial has nothing to 
offer but surfaces. In these poems the 
author has come to terms with life, 
signed the valiant compromise, the 
Medean alternative, delivering her 
awareness over to pain. Her sentience 
speeds to its martyrdom crying, 


“Fire—tears— 
And the torture-chamber, 


With the last maddening turn of the 
screw—”’ 


As one who believes the admixture 
of what we call human nature to be 
changeless, I can recall no better magic 
for any seasonal lovers than this newest 
idealization of the emotions: 


“Oh night of love, your groves of 
Strange content 

Project a thralldom over coming days; 

Exalted, derelict, and blind I went 

Unmindfully along Life’s misty ways.” 


If with us the practice of a book of 
verses underneath the bough, or, better 
still,-before the fire, has grown into 
sneering disrepute, it threatens the 
obsequies of the finest art, the gentle art 
of love-making. Lovers are the only

persons left to us of any elegance at 
all. The last of the aristocrats, the 
Great Lover moves among his menials 
with a soul all prinked out in plumes,

Whatever his age, his past experiences,

shriven and innocent as at the day of 
his birth—or death 


“Consider me a melody 
That serves its simple turn, 
Or but the residue of fire 
That settles in the urn . 


” 


You will know that such snatches of 
song are unfair to the singer, but this, 
and more, Mrs. Johnson has poignantly 
lineated and set down for whatever 
God blessed folk remain in this hard- 
boiled day.

the philosophy of Negroes in the Con- 
garee section of South Carolina The 
work of Mr. Adams must not be con- 
founded with Harlem cabaret stuff or 
with the impossible ‘Rainbow ’Round 
My Shoulder”. The material pub- 
lished here is serious and often beauti- 
ful philosophy of the peasant Negro 
and the outlook upon life is everything 
that a black man could wish. ‘Take, 
for instance, a bit from ““The Yellow 
Bastard”: 

“De door is shet to me. Hemmed in 
on every side, I has nothin’ but dreams. 
An’ my thoughts is floatin’ out, floatin’ 
far above de tall tree tops, here an’ 
dere, listenin’ to de wind’s soft tune 
above de tree tops an’ de clouds. 
Across de stars dey wander for a lone- 
ly moment, an’ den back again an’

is shet to me. Hemmed in, hemmed

AFRIKA SiInGT. Eine Auslese Neuer 
Afro-Amerikanischer Lyrik, by 
Anna Nussbaum. [African Sings. 
An anthology of the newer Afro- 
American poets.] F. G. Speidle, 
Vienna and Leipzig. 


OUR German writers, under the 

editorship of Anna Nussbaum, 
have translated and published a beau- 
tiful German book of Negro-American 
poets. It is tastefully bound, and ex- 
cellently planned. The translations are 
done with care and taste. In her fore- 
word the editor says: “For the first 
time an attempt has been made in this 
book to present a comprehensive selec- 
tion of Afro-American lyrics in the 
German language. Afro-American 
lyrics: songs of Negroes living in 
America who in their race feeling find 
spiritual root in Africa. For this rea- 
son our title is chosen and our thoughts 
are directed with this in view r 


“Africa Sings with young voices; 
with longing for the magic of the old 
home land, which is as old as the world. 
The pain from a thousand years of op- 
pression in a strange land; blind inborn 
faith in deliverance; riotous joy of life 
and deepest humiliation; but also the 
recognition of their own worth; the 
manly determination to do; the power- 
ful devotion to high ideals. The race 
problem becomes a _ class problem. 
Both will and must find solution. 
These voices, so different, all deserve 
to be heard. Their songs are stirring, 
cries for help toward freedom and 
promising witnesses for light amid 
striving humanity.” 


The Anthology has 100 poems 
divided into 9 sections. The sections 
are: “I Am a Negro”, “The White 
God”, “The New Home”, “Work”, 
“You White Folk”, “The Black Wo- 
man”, ‘Harlem’, “The  Poet’s 
Dream”, ‘Love’, “Freedom”, and 


“The Blues’. 


The following poets are represented : 
Langston Hughes, thirty-seven poems; 
Claude McKay, twenty-one; Counteé 
Cullen, ten; Georgia Johnson, seven; 
Jean Toomer, six; Joseph Cotter, Jr., 
Frank Horne, Waring Cuny, Fenton 
Johnson, James W. Johnson and Arna 
Bontemps two each; W. E. B. Du 
Bois, Otto Bohannan, Helene Johnson, 
Gwendolyn Bennett, Angelina Grimké,

The year 1929 is already in its third 
month and those who are going to use 
it for banners must hurry and get 
started. 

NEW ENGLAND 

@ The Allied Art Players of Boston 
under Maud Cuney Hare are keeping 
their banners flying. Last year they 
gave “Ivory, Ebony and Gold”, de- 
scribed as “a handglass of fact and 
fancy,” also a children’s play, and Eu- 
gene O’Neills “The Dreamy Kid”, 
and a workshop play “Backstage”. 
They have had hard sledding but they 
keep at it. 

THE MIDDLE STATES 
@ Will Rogers, the comedian, intro- 
duces distinguished guests from the 
stage now and‘then. Recently, he in- 
troduced to his audience R. R. Moton 
of Tuskegee. 
@ Myles Paige is a young colored at- 
torney of New York City. He has 
just been appointed an Assistant in the 
New York State Labor Department. 
He is a Fisk man and has done good 
work. 
@ Grace P. Postles is a graduate of 
the William Penn High School for 
Girls in Philadelphia. She is now a

cently talked before three thousand 
students of her High School on Negro 
poets. 
@ Jules Bledsoe, who sings “Old 
Man River” in “Show Boat,” is giv- 
ing only one song recital this season; 
this took place at the Gallo Theater, 
New York City, and included songs 
from various great composers; and one 
scene from Verdi’s “Aida”, with a 
white woman singer. It was well 
done, but some New Yorkers felt un- 
easy as the hero spurned the lady’s 
love! 
@ T. Spotuas Burwell, president of 
the National Medical Association, was 
born in Williamsboro, N. C. in 1876. 
Dr. Burwell was educated in the pub- 
lic schools of Williamsboro and at 
Henderson Normal Institute, Hender- 
son, N. C. In 1900 he was graduated 
from Lincoln University with the A.B. 
degree and in 1907 from the Jefferson 
Medical College in Philadelphia with 
the M.D. degree. Dr. Burwell was 
appointed as Clinical Assistant in the 
Department of Diseases of the Chest, 
at Jefferson Hospital, Philadelphia, in 
1915, and as chief of the Department 
of Internal Medicine, Douglas Hospi-

and then became teacher of the village 
school; and not simply teacher, but 
social worker and generous helper in 
the community. Twenty-eight years 
of humble reverent service! 


SOUTHEAST 


@ The Phi Delta Kappa Sorority met 
at Orangeburg, South Carolina with 
nine of the ten chapters represented. 
It will meet in Philadelphia next year. 
@ Dr. Alfred D. Jones served 
twenty-five years as college physician

@ Morehouse College has begun its 
campaign to raise $300,000 toward en- 
dowment. 

@ The Campus Mirror, Spelman Col- 
lege publication, presented “The Pass- 
ing of the Third Floor Back’, a play 
by Jerome K. Jerome, recently. The 
production was directed by Miss Anna 
M. Cooke, assisted by Miss Lillie 
Roudabush and Miss Mae Neptune. 


THE BORDER STATES 
@ Roger Williams University was 
founded at Nashville in 1866. The 
trustees sold its fine site to Peabody 
College at a sacrifice and for a long 
time the colored people tried to rebuild 
the institution in Nashville. At last 
the school has been transferred to 
Memphis and merged with Howe Col- 
lege. The combined institutions will 
be known as Roger Williams College, 
and eventually new buildings will be 
erected on a thirty-acre campus. 
@ Colored people are poor because 
the positions open to them pay small 
salaries. Nevertheless, they have often 
been blamed for not supporting their 


90 


schools. Recently, however, a series 
of bequests from colored men show 
that eventually Negroes are going to 
support higher education. James Dal- 
las Burrus, a member of the first Col- 
lege class of Fisk University, died re- 
cently at Nashville and left an estate 
which may amount to $100,000 to Fisk 
University. Mr. Burrus worked as a 
teacher and a surveyor, and then 
opened a drug store in Nashville. 

@ At a meeting of the Tennessee 
Hi-Y Congress in Nashville last Jan- 
uary, among the fifty-two delegates 
from thirty public schools, there were, 
for the first time, eight delegates from 
two Negro high schools. They were 
accorded every respect and courtesy, 
including the banquet at Farragut Ho- 
tel. A passing reference to “colored” 
delegates was struck out of the min- 
utes at the instance of a white boy. 

@ The Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority 
met at Nashville. The Philadelphia 
Chapter received the cup for greatest 
achievement during the year and the 
New York Chapter received the schol- 
arship award. 


THE MIDDLE WEST 
@ William H. Clifford, who is dead 
at Washington, was in the govern- 
ment service thirty years and was once 
a member of the Ohio legislature. As 
Deputy Clerk in charge of the Cost 


Accounting Division of the state, he 
installed a system which is still in use. 
@ Miles Heights is a suburb of Cleve- 
land with 700 voters, two-thirds of 
whom are white. When the white 
mayor died, the colored president of 
the village council, Arthur Johnson, 
became Mayor. He is repair foreman 
in the County Road Department. 
@ Two hundred and fifty members 
of the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity at- 
tended the 18th Annual Conference at 
Indianapolis. "Two national scholar- 
ships were awarded to colored students 
in white and Negro schools. A schol- 
arship for foreign graduate study was 
given to Forrest O. Higgins, who is 
at the Sorbonne, Paris. 

TRANS MISSISSIPPI 
@ We pictured Dr. A. Porter Davis, 
the colored physician who owns and 
flies an aeroplane at Kansas City, Kan- 
sas. Recently, Dr. Davis has received 
his commercial pilot’s license from the 
United States Government. He is, we 
believe, the first Negro to accomplish 
this. 
@ The University of Nebraska, al- 
though supported by the state, has al- 
ways discriminated in various ways 
against its colored students. Recently, 
six Negro students were refused ad- 
mission to the All-University Dance, 
and in addition to this, colored men

trial, both of the accused persons have 
been dismissed. The seventh man, 
Bubber Kemp, has returned for vindi- 
cation. There is small chance that 
anyone will ever be convicted. 


EUROPE 

@ Cardiff, Wales has a considerable 
colored population with Arabs, So- 
malis, Senegalese, Egyptians, Indians, 
Malays, Portuguese and Chinese. Most 
of these colored foreigners live by 
themselves, but American Negro sail- 
ors are in the habit of mingling with 
white women in public resorts and 
there have been frequent marriages. 
Cardiff is alarmed! 

@ Liberia has for ten years been rep- 
resented in France by a white man, 
Baron E. A. Lehmann. Baron Leh- 
mann was born in Belgium, married 
to an American woman and has just 
died. His burial was attended by a 


large assembly of distinguished people. 


@ The Executive Council of the In- 


ternational Institute of African Lan- 
guages and Cultures met in Berlin dur- 


ing the week of December 20, 1928. 
Lord Lugard presided. 

@ The report of the Jerusalem meet- 
ing of the International Missionary 
Council has been published at the Ox- 
ford University Press in 8 volumes. 
Most of the papers submitted to the 
conference are printed in full. 


SOUTH AFRICA 


@ The Union of South Africa spent 
$2,500,000 in 1926-27 to keep 200,000 
native children in school. This left 
545,000 native children of school age 
with no accommodations. 

@ A school for training native girls 
in Domestic Science is being built at 
Pretoria by the Native Women’s 
Prayer Union which has six thousand 
members. 

@ By an accident at the Crown 
Mines at Johannesburg, South Africa, 
eleven natives were killed. More 
would have perished had it not been 
for the bravery of two natives, M. K. 
Gangwana and J. S. Shibalo, who dis- 
played conspicuous bravery. They have 
been given medals. 

@ The Union of South Africa com- 
pels the railroads to employ white 
labor at a price which makes them pay 
$2,000,000 a year more than they 
would pay for native labor doing just 
as good work. The native labor 
would, of course, be underpaid just as 
grossly as the white labor is now over- 
paid. 

@ In the approaching general elec- 
tion the native question looms above 
all others. The Nationalist Party is 
openly opposing the native policy of 
Cape Colony and has declared for a 
“white South Africa”. The growth 
of colored trade unionism is greatly 
alarming the whites. Some of them 
are proposing a law to prevent Ne- 
groes from becoming bakers, butchers 
and masons. 

@ The Indusfrial and Commercial 
Workers Union of South Africa, 
known as the I. C. U., publishes a six- 
paged Worker’s Herald, in Bantu and 
English. The I. C. U. had an inter- 
view with the Honorable W. B. 
Madely concerning conditions of black 
workers in the Johannesburg Post 
Office. Because of his act, Madely 
was compelled to resign his Cabinet 
Office of Minister of Posts and Tele- 
graphs. His successor, H. W. Samp- 
son, has declared that he will not 
recognize the I. C. U. in any way.

WEST AFRICA 
@ It is reported that the French 
have appointed a commission to in- 
vestigate the whole question of the 
representation of the native races of 
the French colonies in the French 
Parliament. At present, only a few 
colonies are represented and the right 
of suffrage is greatly restricted. 
@ The first native Catholic Priest, 
Abbé Kwakume, was ordained in 
French Togoland last September. 
@ A public library has been opened 
in Monrovia, Liberia. It has 1500 
volumes and a reading room. Ex- 
President Barclay made the main ad- 
dress. 
@ At the Commencement exercises 
of Liberia College in December there 
were. seven graduates, of whom three 
belonged to the native tribes. Among 
the graduates was the eldest son of 
the President of Liberia. The Com- 
mencement address was delivered by 
the American Minister, William T. 
Francis, who had the degree of LL.D. 
conferred upon him. 
@ The Firestone Company has at 
present 30,000 acres planted in rubber 
trees in Liberia. 
@ His Highness, Ademola II, Alake 
of Abeokuta, Nigeria, British West 


Africa, has celebrated the 8th Anni- 
versary of his coronation. He is said 
to be an efficient administrator. 


@ Due to the pressure of the West 
Africa National Congress, the Gov- 
ernment of Sierra Leone has estab- 
lished a West African Court of Ap- 
peal through a British order-in-council. 


@ There are at present in the Bel- 
gian Congo 500 European Catholic 
priests and 16 native priests. There 
are 500,000 Roman Catholic natives 
and 150,000 native children in the 
Catholic Mission schools. 


@ M. Albert Londres, a French jour- 
nalist, after a six months’ tour in 
French, West Africa, has been strong- 
ly criticizing French colonial methods. 
He declares that the system of trans- 
port by human porters is the main evil, 
and that the natives of French, West 
Africa are dying off or migrating to 
other colonies. 

@ The importation of alcoholic liq- 
uors into the British Gold Coast has 
increased from 179,597 gallons in 
1920, to 1,312,258 in 1927, an advance 
of more than 600%. Ninety per cent 
of the spirits imported consists of 
gin. Native leaders are protesting 
against this flood of liquor. 


@ In Fumban, capital of Bamoum 
in French Cameroons, there are Afri- 
can weavers, potters, wood carvers, 
sculptors and ivory workers. The 
French have encouraged the natives to 
use local manufactures rather than im- 
portations, so that the native weavers 
make the cloth and covers, and arti- 
sans design the furniture and _ potters 
make the pipes and bowls. 


EAST AFRICA 
@ The report of the Hilton-Young 


Commission on the closer union of the 
British Dependencies in Eastern and 
Central Africa has been issued. It 
declares that East Africa, as a whole, 
can never be exclusively a white man’s 
country but must depend upon Negro 
labor; consequently, the native popv- 
lation must eventually share in politi- 
cal responsibility. The report, there- 
fore, recommends a new Colonial sta- 
tus for the East African colonies which 
shall be something between Crown col- 
ony government and the independence 
of a self-governing dominion. 

@ Dr. Norman Leys has denied the 
statement of Thomas Jesse Jones that 
the present land reservations for the 
natives in Kenya are ample.

ECONOMIC PRIZES 
Wi. are having a queer experience 


with the Economic Prizes offered 
by Negro banks and insurance societies 
through THe Crisis. They were an- 
nounced first early in 1927; then with- 
drawn because of lack of response, and 
announced again in March, 1928. At 
the close of the Contest, December 31, 
1928, only twenty-one entries were re- 
ceived, and of these only six came any- 
where near the requirements laid down. 
These requirements asked “for stories, 
essays or cartoons which will illustrate 
or study or tell the story of the eco- 
nomic development of the Negro.” We 
will consider carefully the merits of the 
six entrants and announce our decision 
concerning them in the May number 
of THE Crisis. 

Meantime, however, it seems cer- 
tain that the young Negro writers and 
thinkers of today are not applying their 
minds to the economic problem of their 
race. And yet that problem is, and, 
for many generations, must be, the cen- 
tral problem of our existence and sur- 
vival. How are we going to bring the 
attention of the young to the impor- 
tance of that problem? Manifestly 
prizes for writing are not effective. 
What will be effective? We shall be 


glad to learn. 


THE “BROTHERHOOD” OF 
RAILWAY TRAINMEN 


R. WILLIAM DOAK, Vice 

President of the Brotherhood of 
Railroad Trainmen, which, as Mr. 
Green assures us, has the sympathy of 
the American Federation of Labor, is 
a candidate for Secretary of Labor 
under President Hoover. We trust that 
if he is appointed it will be with no 
misapprehension on the part of the 
President-elect as to the sort of thing 
that he is doing. 

William Doak was for a long time 
an employee in the great railroad yards 
of the city of Bluefield, West Virginia, 
and in his official capacity, there was 
no one more active and more deter- 
mined to remove all Negro employees 
from the railroad than Mr. Doak. He 
left there and went to Roanoke, Vir- 


ginia, and there maintained this atti- 
tude of hostility. 


March, 1929 





It was not simply that he kept Ne- 
groes out of his Union. According to 
the Constitution of the Union of which 
he is Vice President, no person of 
Negro descent, no matter what his 
ability, character or training has been, 
can ever be a member of the Railroad 
Trainmen’s Union. But this is not 
enough for Mr. Doak. In addition to 
that, he has tried to see to it that every 
decent way of earning bread and butter 
on the part of Negroes, so far as rail- 
ways are concerned, shall be cut off. 

To put a man of this kind in the 
Cabinet as Secretary of Labor, would 
be the grimmest joke ever perpetrated 
at the expense of a long suffering peo- 
ple. There are in the United States 
numbers of well-meaning folk who ask 
insistently why Negroes as a mass are 
the enemies of American Labor, and 
why they are available for scabs and 


strike-breakers. One terse answer is 
Doak. 


SPEAKING OF ADVERTISING 


O repeat what I have given voice to 

elsewhere: for many years advertis- 
ing in colored papers was looked upon 
by the majority of advertisers as either 
charity or blackmail. Someone came to 
your store on behalf of the struggling 
little colored weekly. He wanted an ad- 
vertisement. You gave him and adver- 
tisement and paid a couple of dollars. 


You did not for a moment expect to: 


get any return from it. It was a way 
of helping a struggling enterprise and 
the enterprise deserved help. 

Or again, some pungent young 
writer with a bitter tongue began to 
column and caluminate in the local 
paper. You thought it wise to keep him 
off you. Moreover, there might have 
been reasons why you were a bit sensi- 
tive; it it possible that you were “‘play- 
ing the numbers”, or gambling in other 
ways; or that your record had not al- 
ways been like the driven snow; or 
that you were more interested in selling 
goods than in having goods worth sell- 
ing. In any of these cases, it was wise 
to see that this young writer did not 
pay his respects to you. Four or five 
inches of advertising often arranged 
that. 

All that was years ago. Some traces 
of the system remain but the mass of 


sills 


Negro papers and advertisers have 
passed to another phase. Colored ad- 
vertisers gradually found out, some- 
what to their surprise, that advertise- 
ments in colored papers now and then 
brought returns: if an entertainment 
was going to be given, it made a good 
deal of difference whether it was ad- 
vertised in the local paper or not. If 
there were rooms or houses to rent, if 
a new store was to be opened, if a 
lecture was to be given—all these 
things called for advertisement and the 
advertisement paid directly and 
promptly. The columns of Negro 
newspapers began, therefore, to be filled 
with this kind of advertising and a 
good and steady income from this 
source was gradually built up. 

Today, we are entering into a third 
phase of advertising so far as Negroes 
are concerned. It is a phase that has 
long been current among white periodi- 
cals. It consists of advertising, not with 
the idea of direct and immediate sales, 
but for the sake of establishing and 
emphasizing a line of thought. Firms 
that invented and reiterated the words 
Sapolio, Kodak, Ampico, are not 
thinking so much of the direct sales 
which each advertisement will encour- 
age, but they are making the public 
think in terms of these words. They 
are establishing a psychology that will 
make a person turn almost instinctively 





_ from “cleaning” to “Sapolio”. 


Advertising becomes, therefore, a pe- 
culiarly effective process of public edu- 
cation, and while these advertisements 
do not always pull directly, indirectly 
they make millions think and act. 

This phase of advertising, the Negro 
business man, and the Negro periodi- 
cal, do not, as yet, justly appreciate. 
‘Take, for instance, the case of Negro 
banks. There are thirty or forty effec- 
tive Negro banks in the United States. 
How many Negroes know this? Or, 
if they know it, realize it? The banks 
do not advertise to any large extent. 
This is as true of white banks as it is 
of Negro banks. But in the case of 
Negro banks, it is mecessary and 
imperative to establish a new psychology 
among colored people. All colored 
people know that there are white banks, 
and they put most of their money into 
these banks. The only thing that most 
of them know about colored banks is 


93 


that two good sized ones failed last 
year. They do not know that the per- 
centage of failure among Negro banks 
is not any larger, if it is as large, than 
among white banks; that the average 
Negro bank is a safe institution to 
which they can entrust their funds. 

Now this kind of fact concerning 
Negro banks must be brought to the 
attention of the colored people, and as 
I have once or twice suggested to the 
Colored Bankers’ Association, they 
ought to unite in national advertising 
on a moderate scale to make the col- 
ored people realize that there are safe, 
conservative Negro banks. The colored 
insurance societies are not so backward. 
They are realizing that national adver- 
tising among colored people pays and 
that they must do more of it and on a 
national scale. Other lines of Negro 
business will come to note this situa- 
tion, and Negro periodicals are the ones 
that should be foremost in bringing this 
psychological phase of advertising to 
the attention of the whole race. 

The whole matter is not simply 
money making: it is education. The 
world needs education in economics and 
business. The education in these lines 
furnished by advertisers is not always 


to be trusted—it is often misleading. ~ 


But an independent and honest periodi- 
cal will not accept lying and degrading 
advertisements, nor will it allow any 
advertiser to dictate its policy. At the 
same time the fact is today that the ad- 
vertiser and not the reader gives the 
periodical, black and white, its main 
support. While then the business man- 
ager is mainly interested in the adver- 
tiser, the advertiser is interested. in the 
reader. The editor occupies a curious 
position between. If he is a hireling 
and a money-grabber, he says nothing 
to offend any possible advertiser and 
caters to the lowest layer of the mass 
of his readers. If he is a Man with a 
Message, he hews on and the chips hit 
fools in the eye and jackasses in the 
midst of their braying. Verily he has 
his reward. 


“DON’T YOU REMEMBER 


« ME?” 
“7 ) ON’T you remember me?” | 
always hear the question with 
an uncontrollable sinking of heart. | 
cannot put aside the feeling of panic. 
I do not remember the person and the 
person knows perfectly well that I do 
not. I am desperately trying to find 
some adequate answer, although I 
know there is none, and the person is 
trying, with more or less success, usu- 
ally less, not to show his pique. 

One of my latest experiences was in 
Asbury Park. I was lecturing on a 
warm night. There was a large audi- 
ence in a low ceilinged room,—a kind 


94 





audience who listened a long time, not 
simply to what I said, but to what 
many others said. It was late before 


I was released and I was tired. I came 
out on the darkened street. A man 
was standing in the shadow. I saw 


his bulk but I have not yet seen his 
face clearly. He was very dark and 


reticent. 

“Don’t you remember me?” he 
said. I wanted to say, “I have not 
seen your face yet,” but I tried to be 
pleasant. “I am afraid—” I began 
gropingly. 


He seemed surprised. ‘Why I was 
a student at Atlanta,” he said. I could 
feel a surge of resentment boiling up 
in both of us. I left Atlanta exactly 
eighteen years before. How many 
years before that I had seen this boy 
I do not know. Whether he was a 
student in my class or just one of the 
general mass of students, I had no 
idea. He was a man now evidently 
of much less than middle-age. Twenty 
years ago he was a mere boy; did he 
realize how much he had changed in 
those years and how many thousands 
of people I had met in two decades? 
Did he really expect that, without any 
help from him, I was going instantly 
to recall him? If he did, he was dis- 
appointed and I was mad. Despite all 
my resolutions, I get thoroughly out 
of patience with this kind of thing, and 
it happens again and again. 

Others have their methods of meet- 
ing the situation: there was Bishop 
Turner with his massive body and 
voice like a bull: “What? Do I 
know you? Of course, I know you! 
Now what’s your name?” with a 
hearty thump on the back. “John 
Smith? Oh yes. And where are you 
from? Americus? Let’s see. Who's 
your father? Yes? Yes! Yes!” 

“He knew me!” says the proud and 
gleeful man, as he goes away. 

Once or twice, tentatively and with 
hesitation, I have tried that plan. But 
it won’t work—tentatively and with 
hesitation. Only a master blaggart 
can put that sort of thing over. 


On the other hand, the late Booker 
Washington, who was Forgetfulness 
itself, had another method. His Secre- 
tary would hasten ahead and canvass 
the room. By the time Mr. Wash- 
ington came in, he met him, suave and 
smiling. 

“Mr. Washington, you remember 
Mr. Jones of Memphis, the President 
of the bank, who entertained you while 
you were—” “Qh, yes, yes, Mr. 
Jones. So glad to see you.” This 
plan works easily, when one can hire 
traveling Secretaries. Theodore 
Roosevelt had a natural gift for faces 
and names, and he cultivated it; he did 
almost miraculous things in the line of 
recalling acquaintances. But imagine 


the time and strength that it must have 
taken! Perhaps, otherwise, he might 
be living yet. 

Personally, I am hopeless at such 
deeds of memory. My memory per- 
forms the most extraordinary feats, I 
will remember the red stripe of the 
table cover at San Diego, California, 
and utterly forget my own telephone 
number. And as for the names which 
are most illogically and inconsequently 
attached to human beings, | can te. 
member few and seldom. 

I do not for a moment discount the 
misfortune of such lack of ability to 
recall. Frequently, I would have been 
willing to pay large sums of money in 
cash to have been able to say: 

“John Bull of Miami! 1 met you 
at 3:00 P. M., Saturday, April 4, 1903, 
at the corner of Beale and what-vov- 
may-call-it Street, Memphis. You had 
eaten onions for dinner. How is your 
youngest boy who was then three?” 
That is what I would like. This is 
what I get: A dark-eyed lady looks 
at me reproachfully with—“I have met 
you three times!” While I am strug. 
gling not to blurt out: “My God, 
woman, you don’t think I want to for- 
get you, do you?” You see with mod- 
ern women it is all impossible, any- 
way. What with a new hat, a short 
dress, bobbed hair and brown powder, 
how in the name of Tophet am I going 
to recognize in 1928 my charming 
friend of 1923? One of these floated 
on me at yesternight’s gathering. | 
stood like a dumb fool. There was 
something familiar, of course, but who 
the Heck!—Los Angeles, London, 
Charleston, Memphis?—who, what, 
when? She went crimson with in- 
dignation and flew. So did I. | fell 
on the Village Gossip. “Who?” | 
gasped. “Smith!” he yelled. “Gerech- 
tige Gott!” I murmured. 

Now I ask why could she not have 
come up and frankly said: “I am Fran- 
ces Smith of Nashville!’ Why assume 
that anyone is happy to forget you; 
or if you do assume it, why speak at 
all? No, the fact is we colored folk 
are used to being snubbed and forgot- 
ten. We have the complex. We ex- 
pect it. We expect that if anyone 
climbs a social ladder or gets notorious 
for any reason he will celebrate with 
the cheap snobbery of pretending to 
forget his former friends. We expect 
this so faithfully that we recognize it 
when it is not there and never was. 

But what a compliment to pay 4 
poor beggar who wants to be decent 
to have such an accusation slapped full 
into his astonished face!

held. Another claimant of national 
championship honors is Wiley, Texas 
Conference champion, which, like Blue- 
field, won all games but one and staged 
a tie in that one. Wiley had a fast 
charging and hard hitting line and a 
backfield of excellent ball carriers, toss- 
ers and punters. Wiley’s entire team 
was good, a smooth-working machine 
that crushed everything in its path. 


KLAHOMA had a clean record. 

It won four games and tied two. 
Its schedule was harder than in 1927. 
Fighting every minutes of the game, 
it gave its opponents much to worry 
about and gained the good will of fans 
everywhere. Every player was a star, 
with Miller, end, Doster, center, An- 
derson, full, and Crisp, quarter, the 
outstanding lights. 

Hampton performed well, winning 
the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic As- 
sociation championship. It lost but one 
game, a non-conference affair. Atlanta 
had one of the strongest combinations 
in the country. It lost to Tuskegee 
and beat Clark, and with them, is tied 
for the championship crown of the 
Southeastern Athletic Association. 
West Virginia played superior foot ball 
all season, winning five games, ty- 
ing one and losing one. Fisk had a 
good team, a scrapping, fighting and 
courageous group of players who were 


masters of every angle of foot ball.

In Mississippi, Alcorn developed a 
team which won all games but one, a 
tie with Southern. Howard, under the 
excellent coaching of West, former 
Washington and Jefferson star back, 
played consistent football, losing but 
one game, West Virginia trouncing it 
27—7. Tuskegee’s dream of another 
year of victories did not materialize. 
Tuskegee looked weak and worn in its 
games with Knoxville and North Caro- 
lina A. and T., and when Clark de- 
feated it, fans were not surprised.

beaten Tuskegee by three touchdowns, 
but A. and T. failed to play winning

One of the big surprises of the sea- 
son was Morgan. Its defeat of Lin- 
coln and its tie with Howard marked 
it stronger than it was rated to be. It 
lost only to Bluefield and Virginia 
State. Injuries to several players in 
the first game of the season brought 
Kentucky State losses which it felt dur- 
ing the entire season. Richardson, a 
tall, strong and game youngster, Ken- 
tucky State’s center, was everywhere 
in every game and was one of the most 
accurate passer-backs of the season. 
The Wilberforce team lacked punch 
and power in the early days of 1928. 
As the season grew older, Wilberforce 
played better, and in its last game on 
Thanksgiving Day at Cleveland, Ohio, 
it outfought and outplayed West Vir- 
ginia.

make it their task to say whether this 
work shall continue to struggle along 
on insignificant and inadequate bud- 
gets or whether it shall be properly 
financed. They can determine whether 
the time of the officers of the N. A. 
A. C. P. must continue to be given to 
the wasteful task of money-raising or 
whether they shall be relieved of this 
burden in order to devote themselves 
altogether to the work which the As- 
sociation faces. For many cases, urgent 
cases, come to the Association which it 
has not the means to defend. 

The Association has proposed for 
this year of the twentieth anniversary 
of its foundation, the raising of a fund 
of $200,000. This means less than 
two cents per person for each one of the 
twelve million Negroes in America. It 
means also that this fund will be a 
contribution of $10,000 for each year 
the Association has been in existence. 


S the work of the Association worth 
two cents apiece to the Negroes of 
the United States? Has what it has 
accomplished been worth the sum of 
ten thousand dollars a year, this money 
to be used in furthering, extending and 
strengthening its efforts? 

The answer to these questions in this 
year of 1929, is in the hands of the 
colored and white friends of the N. A. 
A. C. P. They know its record. If 
they do not, the record in detail, can 
be had for the asking. Whether they 
live in the North or in the South, they 
are vitally concerned. William Pick- 
ens has rightly said that if any New 
York or Chicago or Boston or other 
northern colored man or woman thinks 
himself or herself a free United States 
citizen with the privileges of the citi- 
zen, let him go to Mississippi and see 
whether that is true. And the fact 
remains that while color discrimina- 
tion remains, it remains an ill that 
threatens to spread. 

So here is the instrument of those 
who want to make Mississippi as decent 
a place to live in as New York, to make 
Florida as safe as for any Negro as 
Boston. The Association has gone sev- 
eral long steps on this way. But im- 
measurably much remains to be done. 
Will the Negroes and white friends 
of the Association give it ten thousand 
dollars a year on its twenty-year record 
of achievement? Will the colored 
people of America give it two cents 
apiece? What will you give?

IN THE MAGAZINES 


66 — Morality of African 
Races”, an article by E. Tor- 


day in the International Journal of 
Ethics for January, should propagate 
among our Caucasian brethren an in- 
feriority complex. In discussing the 
ethics of the East African, Mr. Tor- 
day says: when it happens that one 
tribe captured all of the cattle of an- 
other, some of the loot was sent back 
to the defeated enemy so that he might 
live to fight another day; and when 
women were captured, the victors 
married them and adopted their chil- 
dren. Trial by jury consisted not the 
judgment of twelve men “tried and 
true”, but of the judgment of the chief 
assisted by the whole population. 
While the East African’s sanitary ar- 
rangements are not as modern as those 
of some of the northern countries, they 
compare quite favorably with those of 
southern Europe: natives never use wa- 
ter for domestic purposes unless it has 
been previously filtered; they isolate 
people suffering from contageous dis- 
eases; and they have an_ excellent 
knowledge of medicinal plants. 

George S. Schuyler writes on “Ra- 
cial Intermarriage in the United 
States” for the December issue of The 
American Parade. Mr. Schuyler says 
that the myth that a natural aversion 
exists between the white and_ black 
races is shattered by the passing of anti- 
intermarriage laws; and the fact that 
miscegenation dates from the first ap- 
pearance of Negroes in this country. 
Despite the common belief that mixed 
couples are the “dregs of civilization”, 
Mr. Schuyler found through ques- 
tionnaires which he sent over the coun- 
try, that usually these couples are quiet, 
inconspicuous and of good character. 
In twenty-nine of the states, mixed 
couples can be jailed and heavily fined 
for living in concubinage, and in many 
cases, have served penitentiary sei- 
tences even after the marriage cere- 
mony. 

The Debunker for January “de- 
bunks” the colored ecclesiastic. In dis- 
cussing the “Menace of the Negro 
Preacher”, the article declares that 
Negroes as a group are church crazy 
and that the church has as retarding 
an effect on the progress of black peo

ple in this country as four wheel 
brakes have on the progress of a Ford. 
White people have consciously and 
: «ee és 
conscientiously inflicted the “church 
and heaven-bound” complex on their 
dusky brothers. The Negro church in 
all its flamboyant glory is best seen 
in the Baptist, African Methodist 
Episcopal and African Methodist Epis- 
copal Zion denominations ; however, 
the star performers are the Baptists. 
Negro ministers draw salaries all out 
of proportion to the social and spiritual 
benefit they are to their communities. 
In closing, the article advises the Ne- 
gro to become economically stable and 
to intensify his acquisitive instinct. We 
need more dollars and intelligence, and 
less preaching. 

In the Survey for January 15th, 
Alain Locke offers a resumé of “The 
Washington Conference on the Amer- 
ican Negro”. Mr. Locke says: “The 
conference did not settle the race ques- 
tion, but it did settle many influential 
representative minds, and it reinforced 
much isolated and lonely liberalism 
with the realization that a rapidly ac- 
cumulating body of sound facts and 
human precedent are on the side of 
progress.” 

Otto Huiswood in the Communist 
for December in discussing ‘““The Ne- 
gro and the Trade Unions”, gives a 
summary of the Negro platform of the 
Communist Party. The Party is 
fighting for the admittance and the in- 
clusion of Negro workers in existing 
trade unions on equal basis; and if 
Negroes are not admitted into existing 
unions, the Communists will endeavor 
to organize them into independent 
unions and continue the fight against 
segregation from the regular unions. 
In new unions the Negro must be 
taken in on the basis of complete equal- 
ity. 

“The Negro student isn’t what he 
used to be,” cries the reactionary col- 
ored parent and the white philanthrop- 
ist who is accustomed to dictating the 
policy of the Negro institution of 
which he is the benefactor. The strin- 
gent rules governing the student bodies 
of most of the colored institutions, says 
John Davis in discussing “The Unrest 
in Negro Colleges” in The New Stu- 
dent for January, are based on two 
fallacies: Negro students are not pre- 
pared for the exercise of free will; and 
the current belief is that the white 
trustee and executive knows the best 
method of Negro education. The re- 
currence of disorders ranging from the 
expulsion of individual students to 
wholesale strikes, says Mr. Davis, 
shows that there is something radically 
Wrong. Consider a typical routine of 
the Negro college: “Rise at 6:00 o’- 
clock ; dressing and arranging rooms, 
6:00 to 6:45; inspection, 6:45; break- 


March . 1020 


fast, 7:00; morning session, 8:00 to 
12:00; chapel 12:00 to 12:15; dinner, 
12:30 to 1:00; afternoon session, 1:15 
to 4:10; study, 7:00 to 10:00; in- 
spection, 9:45; retiring signal lights 
out, 10:15.” The Negro student is 
a toy wound up; what time has he for 
human contact? Who wouldn't 
strike? 

Editorially the Nation for January 
16th cries “Shame to Mississippi” and 
suggests that Governor Bilbo need not 
investigate the two thousand people 
who witnessed the mob murder ; he need 
only take steps to depose the sheriff 
of the county in which Sheppard 
a colored man, was lynched, the Ad- 
jutant General of the Militia who said 
after he heard that the mob had the 
Negro, “he ordered his troops home 
as he was thirty miles from the scene 
and couldn’t do anything anyway”, and 
the prison superintendent who called 
for troops to find the Negro, but not to 
protect him when he was found. 


“I Nevah Done It,” is the cry- 
lament of black Satchel Charley, who 
has been accused of the murder of a 
southern farmer, a ‘damned Republi- 
can at that”, who had fired him be- 
cause he was a lazy, worthless hand. 
Satchel Charley is clubbed to uncon- 
sciousness and when light drifts back 
to him, his bleeding lips form the 
words, “No suh, I nevuh done it.” 
In the course of time, he is convicted 
of the murder and afterwards confesses 
to a reporter that he had been sleeping 
with Jim Black’s gal that night— 
that Jim would surely kill him if he 
found out. Where could he turn? 
The white daily refused to militate 
against Charley’s electrocution, be- 
cause the case was cut and dried— 


Satchel Charley murdered that white 


man—that he was sleeping with an- 
other black man’s “nigger wench” 
wouldn’t make so sensational a story. 
And so Charley goes to the chair with 
the words “I nevuh done it” on his 
lips. The story is by Dave A. Chea- 
vens and can be found in Plain Talk 
for February.

January, 1929, has the following ar-

THE FAR 


SIXTH NATIONAL CO- 
OPERATIVE CONGRESS 
The 
United States of America is a federation 


of about 329 of the most progressive 
consumers’ stores, bakeries, restaurants, 


Co-operative League of the 


apartment houses, credit societies, cream- 
eries, and various other types of business 


undertakings. The membership of these 


associations is made up of farmers, big 
and little, factory workers, miners, rail- 


road men, office employees, professional 
people, in fact, people of every class who 
know that they are exploited as con- 
sumers and are trying to find a remedy 
in co-operative organization. 

The success of the consumers’ co- 
operative movement in America was evi- 
denced at the Sixth National Congress 
of the Co-operative League of the United 
States of America, which was held in 
Waukegan, Illinois, October 29, 30, and 
31, 1928. This congress outranked all 
previous Congresses of the League as re- 
gards both delegates present and interest 
displayed in vital questions. The Co- 
operative Union of Canada and the Rus- 
sian Co-operative Movement were rep- 
resented by delegates. Fraternal greet- 
ings to the congress were sent from the 
Soviet Union, England, Sweden, Norway, 
Finland, Holland, Tchekkoslovakia, 
Hungary, Belgium, Latvia, Ukraine, 
Switzerland, Denmark, France, Scot- 
land, and Spain. 


The secretary reported a membership 
in the League of 155 societies with indi- 
vidual members totaling 77,826 and an- 
nual sales totaling $14,000,000 (not in- 
cluding the figures for credit and insur- 
ance societies). 

Waukegan, Illinois, is a city of less 
than 40,000 inhabitants and one-third of 
the population is benefitting from the co- 
operative movement. This city has five 
co-operative societies; one among the 
Lithuanians, one among the Slovenians, 
two Finnish boarding house societies, 
and the Co-operative Trading Company 
including all nationalities. 

The Co-operative Trading Company 
started as a dairy in 1911 with a capital 
stock of only $630. Since that time the 
Co-operative has branched out into many 
lines of business. The sales for the first 
six months of this year amounted to 
$325,989.47 paying surplus savings to 
members amounting to $14,376.00. In 
1925 the Co-operative Trading Company 
spent 7 per cent of their total earnings 
($1,500.00 for educational work. 

The Co-operative Trading Company 
acted as host to the Sixth National Co- 
operative Congress. Co-operators saw 
there the second largest consumers’ dairy 
in the country as well as the second 
largest co-operative society. In addition 


% 
HORIZON? 


to the dairy department there was the co- 
operative bakery, two meat stores, and 
three stores for the sale of general gro. 
ceries and fresh produce. 


The achievements of co-operation are 
worthy of the study of those who are 
considering an economic program for the 
Negro. 


BOY SCOUTS 


The Scout Executives of the United 
States representing every State in the 
Union, in convention at Ithaca, New 
York, unanimously adopted the follow- 
ing resolution: 

“The committee looks with favor and 
appreciation upon the progress that has 
been made since the Hot Springs Confer- 
ence in making Scouting available to ra- 
cial groups and recommends that every 
Council give careful consideration to the 
subject of making available, at least on 
an experimental basis, Troop service to 
boys of other races. 


“Rather remarkable progress has been 
made in developing the Boy Scout Move- 
ment among Negro boys. At the Hot 
Springs Conference in 1926 only 248 
Troops were in operation among Negro 
boys. Practically all of these were in 
Northern States. At the Ithaca Con- 
ference 581 Troops were reported, al- 
most a third of which are in the South, 
and Troops were reported from every 
State in the South. The resolution from 
the committee was proposed by one 
Southern man and endorsed by another 
and the report of the committee was 
unanimously adopted, indicating that the 
Scout Movement can be counted upon’to 
give wholehearted cooperation in devel- 
oping Troops among Negro boys. 

“While many problems have arisen in 
connection with the development of the 
program of work among Negro boys, 
the Boy Scout Movement has tried very 
hard to keep to the minimum racial an- 
tagonism. A recent report of the Na- 
tional Director says: ‘While the Negro 
hoy, the son of Spanish, Japanese, Aus- 
trian, Italian, Russian and other for- 
eigners in this country, must be given 
special attention, it would be criminal 
for us in the development of this work 
to raise the race question in any com- 
munity where there is not already a race 
consciousness. Our responsibility is to 
develop conditions so that the largest 
possible number of boys will become 
Scouts and to forget the race question 
wherever it is possible to do this work 
without the question entering in. It is 
our obligation, however, to teach the Boy 
Scout Program to these boys and it is 
our opportunity to take local conditions 
as we find them and to make the pro- 
gram effective with leadership available 
and in spite of the obstacles that may be 
in the way.’ ”

THE LAND OF FLOWERS 


E recall this case from 1928: In 

Orlando, Florida, Haywood Rix- 
by, a Negro, forty years of age, was 
shot and killed by Chief of Police, H. 
F. Baker. Rixby is a well-to-do Negro 
and recently bought a store on West- 
moreland and Bently Streets from a 
white woman. After he had bought 
the store, he continued to employ the 
woman. A policeman passed the place 
and saw’ the woman working and 
warned her and her people that she 
must not work for a Negro. Finally, 
they got out a warrant against Rixby 
charging him with ‘‘an attempt to as- 
sault the girl”. The Chief and four 
of his officers went down to the store, 
but Rixby was not there. Just as they 
started away, he drove up in his auto- 
mobile and got out with his back to- 
ward the policemen. As he turned 
they shot and killed him. They al- 
leged that he was about to draw his 
pistol; that he was a “bad” Negro and 
had been arrested several times ‘on 
minor offenses”. ‘‘Rixby was consid- 
ered wealthy, owned considerable 
property in West Orlando”. The cor- 
oner’s jury exonerated the Chief of 
Police. 

April 9, 1928. Chief of Police, 
Baker and four detectives, were in- 
dicted by the Orange County Grand 
Jury and charged with second degree 
murder. They were released on bonds 
of $5,000 each. Meantime, a person 
on the spot writes us: ‘‘Please investi- 
gate. The police have been keeping 
Rixby’s daughter and wife for a long 
time. The dead man was a large prop- 
erty owner and had no gun.” 

The joys of wintering in this land 
of sun and flowers are quite beyond 
description. 


“JIM CROW” SCHOOLS IN 
PHILADELPHIA 


"THE Philadelphia Tribune, a col- 
ored paper, has the following 
comment : 


Two hundred and sixty-four Negroes 
are employed in the Philadelphia 
Public School System. ‘They are dis- 
tributed as follows: 250 grammar school 
teachers, 12. principals of grammar 
schools, 1 supervisor of art, 1 medical 
examiner. They are restricted to segre- 
gated schools. None teach in the junior 
or high schools. There are 363 public 
schools in Philadelphia. The total num- 
er of teachers in the entire system are 
7888. The precentage of colored 
teachers to the total is slightly over 3 
percent. There are 233 white principals 
as to 12 Negroes. This condition ob- 
tains in spite of the fact that “jim crow” 
schools were accepted in order to secure 
employment. It clearly illustrates that 
equitable distribution can never be ob- 


March, 19209 





tained where there is distinction based 
on race or color. The weaker group 
always receives a great deal less than 
the stronger. Jim Crow schools give 
employment to a mere handful as com- 
pared with the total Negro population. 
As a purely job securing proposition 
segregated schools fail in their objective. 


NEAR NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE 
ENGLAND 


EAR Crisis: 

As it seems possible you may 
not see our excellent old Sunday pa- 
per, The Observer, I take great pleas- 
ure in sending you this interesting let- 
ter from today’s issue. As child of a 
noble couple who, eighty years ago, 
risked all and lost nearly all worldly 
things in the cause of human freedom, 
my faith is being greatly strengthened 
by the increasing evidence that our 
whole race—all mankind—is being 
brought to the one and only true 
standard of life and conduct, Jesus 
Christ. On this side the world Shep- 
pard’s “Impatience of a Parson’, fol- 
lowing close after Jones’ “The Christ 
of the Indian Road” is recognized as 
the great event of 1927, and the 
Orient’s challenge of our “falsely so- 
called” Christianity is disintegrating 
the strongholds of ecclesiastical legal- 
ism. 





A few evenings ago I stepped in at 
a Liberal Club political “talkfest” and 
heard with surprise and comfort the 
chief speaker, candidate for Parlia- 
ment, protest determinedly against the 
practice, universal in England, of using 
the opprobrious epithet, “Nigger”. He 
had lived in Africa and Negroes are 
men with many fine qualities, some 
suited to shame us who think ourselves 
1,000 years in advance of them! This, 
in contrast with a beastly young Brit- 
ish bully on the Gold Coast. 

THE Crisis interests me more and 
more. I mourn the loss of that splen- 
did spirit and artist, Florence Mills. 
Sometimes I’m tempted to turn over 
to the N. A. A. C. P. my old birth- 
place of thirteen acres in Illinois, a 
“Station of the Underground Rail- 
road”. y 

Keep Sweet, and Heaven give you 
more grace and power.

My country, Martinique, belongs al- 
most throughout its whole extent to a 
group of whites who exploit us severe- 
ly and to a large degree we have been 
the builders of their power. Naively 
we used to believe especially after the 
war that we merited a better fate. We 
thought we would find some compen- 
sation by living in France. I am thir- 
ty years old and I have lived here a 
dozen years and I am heart-broken at 
having to say that our situation here 
is becoming difficult and delicate be- 
cause people wish to see in us merely 
undesirable rivals whenever we seek 
to raise ourselves above the level where 
people secretly but more or less adroit- 
ly try to keep us. We must reckon 
seriously therefore with this sentiment 
of which you spoke for it might stifle 
every sentiment of justice and human- 
ity in this country, France, which is 
already becoming strongly susceptible 
to the Anglo-Saxon point of view, as- 
similating however its bad side more 
rapidly than its good. 

I do not feel that I am formulating 
this opinion lightly; it is the fruit of 
a dozen years of observation and of 
reflections based on the most intimate 
contact with the French in ihe army 
and in civil life. 


I am thus constrained to betieve that 
our future is to be assured only through 
the closest union of the colored races 
who are peopling America and espe- 
cially the Antilles—C. S$. FANCHINE

INFORMATION 


HE M. R. S. CLUB of our city, a 

member of the Michigan Associa- 
tion of Colored Women’s Clubs, staged 
an original pageant, ‘‘Past, Present and 
Future of the Negro Race”, with ma- 
terial gleaned from THe Crisis, the 
Negro -Year Book and Government 
statistics. It was an educational rally 
and the interest among both races was 
very marked. As the facts and fig- 
ures were all true and could be veri- 
fied, the educational value could not 
be denied. 

Clubs in small towns and cities 
might well stage pageants of this na- 
ture to raise funds as well as broad- 
cast information. Material can be 
easily assembled by studying THe 
Crists monthly.

ly. “You can’t wonder that a poor 
old black man, a drudge all his life, 
should have some little superstitions 
clinging like spider web to his old 
jacket. Good day, Wise Willow 
Oak.” And with a clanging cry the 
jay sped off. 


Killdeer or Killdee 


6617 ILLDEER, killdeer, killdeer!” 

At the first notes of this pierc- 
ing cry in March we children would 
look up for a glimpse of speeding 
plovers, eerie fugitive birds, it seemed 
tous. Fitfully till well on in the fall 
we were to hear these fleeting calls. 
In the marshlands of New Jersey in 
his boyhood father had known the 
plovers even better than we. In some 
parts of the country, I am told, the 
poor little things are served as food. 
This is why their song seems sad to 
me. 

The wan blue skies of March, the 
deep skies of summer and of autumn 
are swept by semicircular bands of 
plovers. Yet I do not see nor hear 
them now as in childhood. 


Dear Brown Killdee 


OU’RE always so rushed, dear 
brown killdee. 
I wish you could stop and play with me. 
You'd tell me about the great free air, 
And how the roofs look from way up 
there. 
And I'd tell you of the reeds and sand, 
Marsh lilies and things I can under- 
stand. 
Perhaps you would sing in your voice so 


airy 
Of those fledgling days on the Arctic 
prairie. 
You're always so rushed, dear brown 


killdee. 


I wish you could stop and play with me. 


The Lady of Violet Time 


T seemed a long adventurous trip 

from my childhood home in Phila- 
delphia to our future Ohio home. We 
arrived in the “Buckeye State” many 
years ago. My grandmother in New 
Jersey thought that we were moving 
far too many miles from her. And it 
did seem rather sad to us children, our 
leaving the wonderful parks and toy 
shops of Philadelphia and the nearby 
scenes of Jersey with orchards, pools 
with pond lilies and bogs that in season 
harbored cranberries.

We were leaving all this for a 
strange place. And yet the Ohio trip 
was pleasant. We landed in a village 
of splendid hills and winding streams 
and long quiet lanes. It was the seat 
of a colored university founded many 
years ago. The campus had inter- 
esting scenes. One day we, a company 
of merry children, climbed up from 
the ravine behind one of the dormi- 
tories to the main campus and from 
there on to the “new building”. 

Here we saw on the porch a stately 
woman, rather tall, olive-colored and 
with coils of silvery hair. She looked 
like a queen as she stood in the door- 
way. . 

“Madam Keckley,” whispered one 
of the children. 

I .remember so well that clear- 
featured beautiful face with the 
thoughtful eyes that looked pleasant- 
ly upon us. “The sewing teacher,” 
was further whispered in explanation. 


ND I thought strongly of hand- 

ing her my precious bunch of vio- 
lets. Would she accept them? Of 
course she would! 


I learned her story later. Born in 
the year 1840, she must have experi- 
enced some of the bitterness of slavery. 
But Madam Elizabeth Keckley could 
not endure this humiliation, and bor- 
rowed the money with which to pur- 
chase her freedom. She was soon 
working industriously as a seamstress 
to repay the loan. She was really 
more than a seamstress. She was a 
modiste. 

After buying her freedom she went 
to Washington to live. Her home had 
been in St. Louis. Always her am- 
bitions were lofty. While her skillful 
needle worked busily on dresses for the 
wives of congressmen she dreamed of 
becoming a modiste to the wife of the 
president of the United States, Mrs. 
Lincoln. 

In this capacity Madam Keckley 
worked for years. And one can ima- 
gine what art must have been required 
in fashioning some of the very striking 
costumes that Mrs. Lincoln is. said to 
have worn. Years before I had seen 
Madam, the modiste, standing on the 
porch in violet time, she had donated 
to the university for the museum some 
of those gifts that Mrs. Lincoln, whose 
friendship she ever remembered and 
cherished, had presented her back in 
= days of hoop skirts and stove pipe
