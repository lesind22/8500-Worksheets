AY we humbly point out at this 

belated hour that the marriage 
of the blond and nordic Belgian Prin- 
cess with a black-avised Italian is a 
dangerous bit of miscegenation and 
ought to have long since evoked a loud 
yawp from Madison Grant and Loth- 
rop Stoddard.—It would seem that the 
Pope and the Paris dressmakers are 
agreed on the total abolition of wom- 
en’s legs—We agree with Senator 
Dill that “the elevation of human 
rights above property rights’ should 
be the ideal of even the Supreme 
Court—The real difficulty with im- 
perialistic intervention is that, like 
vaccination for smallpox, it apparently 
must be periodically renewed. This is 
the only explanation we can conceive 
for the revolution in San Domingo 
and the unrest in Cuba—That naval 
parley intrigues us. The news about 
the stenographers is much more defi- 
mite and reassuring than that about 
battleships. The fact is, that so long 
as England fears the United States, 
France fears America, Germany fears 
France, and America fears Russia, the 
disarmament of the world will not

even be a dream. It will be a night- 
mare.—And speaking of Russia, we 
note her courtesy to the dead Eilieson, 
to the harassed Italian Fascists under 
Nobile and to the dead American sol- 
diers who died fighting freedom in 
Russia. But we see no corresponding 
attempt among the militant Christians 
of the world to understand just what 
religion meant in Russia under the 
Czars. There is nothing in the way 
of superstitious degradation in the 
modern civilized world that quite 
equaled Lenin’s opium.—We are so 
gratified to learn that the Bankers’ 
consortium, which rushed in to rescue 
the Stock Market last fall, has not 
only emerged alive and well but with 
a profit. We had suspected as much. 
—The unemployment in the United 
States, which was not going to happen, 
and which has not happened, and 
which has already passed its climax 
and receded, is still feeding the bread

story by Charles W. Chesnutt; 
something new about Y. W. C.

splendid article on Pushkin, the

course, talk about Haiti and 
Africa, and the work and wage

lines and the poor houses. And the 
first man to be kicked out of a job 
and the last one to be hired, is, as 
usual, the American Negro. — This 
matter of national hymns is really get- 
ting serious. Not only does the same 
tune inspire the patriot of England, 
Germany and the United States, but 
now comes Civil War in Austria over 
words for Haydn’s good old Austrian 
hymn. Anne Spencer suggests that we 
all compromise with the Johnson 
brothers’ Negro national hymn, which 
has better words and music than that 
of any modern nation.—This revolu- 
tion business is getting serious. The 
World Unity Magazine points out 
seven of them: there is the political 
revolution the world over, the indus- 
trial revolution, the financial revolu- 
tion, which has put American on top, 
the scientific revolution of electricity, 
the social revolution of classes and 
races, the religious revolution, which 
terrifies the Pope, and the psychologi- 
cal revolution, which nobody under- 
stands.—And now let the world sit 
and watch the most astonishing of the 
battles of peace which it has ever seen: 
The civil disobedience campaign in In- 


dia, led by Gandhi and Nehru.

They Who Wear the Mask 


T was the end of a strenuous day. 

From early morning until evening 
I had been endeavoring to disentangle 
4 snarl in which two school districts 
had become involved to such an extent 
that the State had been called in to 
arbitrate. Like Louis XIV, I could 
sav—for a day or two—‘L’etat c’est 
moi!” The little county seat was off 
the main-line, and train service was 
limited. Once in the morning and 
once at night, a “‘shoo-fly” connected 
with main-line trains, at a junction 
miles distant. The heat during the 
day had been very oppressive, and as I 
sat on somebody's trunk on the plat- 
form, jacketless and in shirt sleeves, 
the hot air rose in waves from the par- 
allel of hot iron that stretched into 
seemingly interminable miles through 
red clay cuttings and past dark pine 
torests. The shoo-fly was due, but no- 
body possessed of local knowledge, ex- 
pected the three-car train to rock into 
the “depot” for at least thirty minutes. 
Two or three farmers and a few Ne- 
groes were the only other expectant 
passengers. Presently a Negro who 
had been standing at the other end of 
the platform, alone, walked slowly to 
where I was sitting. He was a young 
man, neatly dressed and in possession 
of that intangible something that one 
instinctively recognizes as culture, even 
before a word has been spoken. When 
he addressed me, it was with a soft 
musical voice and with perfect diction. 

“You were at the Court House this 
afternoon talking with the Superin- 
tedent of Schools, weren’t you? I was 
in the outer office and could not help 
catching something of what you said in 
regard to Negro education in this state. 
I am principal of the Negro school at 
and was very much interested 
when you made the remark, that the 
greatest sin of the South is inconsist- 
ency in its education policy towards 
the Negro.” : 

There was something about the man 
that won my immediate interest. My 
work necessitated frequent visits to 
State and private educational institu- 
tions, including some of the leading 
Negro schools and colleges. Not being 
a native of the South, I was able to 
view the “Negro problem” from the 
Point of view of an outsider, yet with 
a sympathetic knowledge of conditions 
colored by two years’ residence in a 
Southern state. I was well aware that 
the attitude of representative public 
opinion in regard to Negro education, 
had changed considerably from that 
national consciousness which created

By ARTHUR J. PEEL 


A white official and a Negro 


teacher meet by chance and discuss 
the Negro problem frankly. 





and launched such activities as Hamp- 
ton Institute and Tuskegee. I had ob- 
served in my professional duties, that 
the tendency more and more, on the 
part of State educational authorities, 
was to provide the Negro children and 
young people with the same kind of 
education furnished in the white 
schools. I had talked frequently with 
Negro leaders in the State regarding 
this matter, and was aware that the 
deeper thinkers among them were not 
blind to the incipient dangers of the 
system. 

To me, the policy of the State 
Board—and this policy is practically 
the same in most of the Southern 
states now—was a tacit admission by 
educational authorities, that the poten- 
tialities of the colored children were 
about the same as those of white chil- 
dren, in the rural districts at least. 
When I began to see this, it came as 
a distinct shock, not because of my per- 
sonal unbelief, but because it was so 
contrary to what I had been led to ex- 
pect from Southerners. Later, when 
I became somewhat intimate with the 
educational work carried on in the pub- 
lic schools, both white and colored, I 
began to see absurdities and paradoxes 
in the whole situation, which may be 
epitomized in the following remark 
made by a Negro girl to her friend, 


while on their way to school, “Is ya did 
va Greek?” 


But to return to my colored friend, 
the school principal. ‘Tell me,” I 
asked, as we talked and waited for the 
shoo-fly, “‘what is your honest opinion 
regarding Negro education as exempli- 


fied in the South?” 


He was silent for several seconds, 
then said, “I think you will understand 
when I tell you that as a boy I had 
one ambition; it was to go to college. 
I went to Howard University and 
graduated with honors. I have been a 
school teacher in this state for four 
vears. Now I am giving up my school 
work and shall probably work a farm.” 
There was a wistfulness and sadness in 
his brief recital that somehow caught 
me like a stab of pain; I felt that be- 
hind all this was a spiritual tragedy. 
There was a long pause, and then I 
said, “Which means, that you see no 
future for your own people along the 


lines of present educational methods 
and policies?” 

“No no, I wouldn’t say that.” 
The response was slow, and his eyes 
seemed to search the darkness which 
was rapidly descending on the pine 
wood on the opposite side of the track. 
“No, hardly that. I see an ultimate 
future for the colored boy and girl 
with academic and business training; 
but the immediate future for our youth 
—educated according to American 
ideals—is so unutterably hopeless, that 
I can no longer continue to be a re- 
sponsible agent for imparting knowl- 
edge which I know will one day break 
their hearts.” 

“But what about your own race—it 
must have its leaders; it must provide 
the fullest scope within itself, for edu- 
cated and mentally trained men and 
women.” As I gave expression to the 
old stock argument, I had a faint hope 
that perhaps he would fail to detect 
the fallacy that lurked in the sugges- 
tion. But this young man had thought 
too deeply, and knew too much, to let 
this escape him. He turned to me sud- 
denly and something like a glint of 
anger flashed in his eyes, as he an- 
swered: 

“Ah! that’s just it: State govern- 
ments and private and Federal agencies 
are pouring millions into Negro 
schools; they are educating our chil- 
dren to the point of self-revelation, un- 
til dreams become practical ambitions 
to achieve. But let the Negro student 
attain educational success, and realize 
his opportunities, then he is told, “Thus 
far shalt thou come, but no farther.’ 
He sees the American Indian student 
enter into privileges denied to the 
American Negro. The educated and 
cultured Indian is accepted and re- 
ceived in white society ; when he quali- 
fies as a doctor, he may have white 
patients; if a lawyer, he may number 
white people among his clients. Even 
Chinese and Japanese students enjoy 
privileges that are denied to American- 
born educated Negroes. You spend 
millions to awaken in the mind and 
consciousness of our colored youth, his 
latent power and mental ability; then 
you deny him the fruit which his 
growth entitles him to pluck, un- 
aided.” 

“IT beg your pardon; I didn’t mean 
to let myself go” he said, with an en- 
gaging smile. Then with that insight 
that probed my shallow armor, added, 
“But you know that what I said, is 
true; and that is why you said this 
afternoon, that the South was incon- 


117

sistent in its educational policy as it 
affects my race. If we are to be only 
hewers of wood and drawers of water, 
then why attempt to give our children 
an educational background which is 
preparatory to vocations and profes- 
sions to which the Negro is to be 
denied access? Would it not be more 
reasonable to revert to the original 
policy which was so much in evidence 
following the Civil War, and provide 
the best facilities for thorough manual 
training ?” 

“No” I answered quickly, “that is 
not the solution. While there are those 
who assert, and honestly believe, that 
your race is mentally inferior to the 
Nordic races; that your cultural life 
is lower—and it is, but cultural poten- 
tiality is as great with your children, 
as it is with white children—the plain 
fact is, that your young men and wo- 
men are to be found in the front rank 
of student attainment in Northern and 
European colleges. It is being increas- 
ingly admitted by those who are in- 
timately associated with Negroes, that, 
by and large, the American Negro is 
not mentally inferior to the Nordic 
races when given the same opportuni- 
ties fer developing his mental life. To 
attempt, now, to arrest this mental de- 
velopment on the part of colored peo- 
ple, would be as fruitless as an attempt 
to stay the tides. Whatever happens, 
and at any cost, you must go on; you 
cannot turn back, nor can you remain 
where you are.” 

“But can we make real progress so 
long as the ‘missionary’ spirit is allowed 
to permeate our colleges and schools?” 

“You are thinking, I suppose, of 
white control and white instructors in 
institutions like Hampton; and of pub- 
lic school systems that are adminis- 
tered entirely by Boards on which Ne- 
groes have no representation?” I asked. 

“Yes, that’s what I mean. It mat- 
ters not how good the white teacher, 
when he or she comes into contact with 
colored pupils or students, there is an 
invisible barrier beyond which neither 
teacher nor student may pass. Whether 
the teacher is conscious of it or not, 
the student is made to feel that there 
is a point beyond which he cannot go 
just as surely as if the instructor said, 
in words, ‘Where I go, you cannot 
follow.’ It is this attitude of white 
leadership in Negro colleges and 
schools, that strikes at a fundamental 
doctrine of education: The teacher 
must lead his students just as far as 
they will follow; and he must be will- 
ing also to stand aside and see them 
advance beyond his leadership, if need 
be. But the Nordic belief of superior- 
ity injects a thought of limitation on 
the Negro, just at that period when 
fuller development is possible.” 

“You must not forget,” I replied, 


118 


“that it was the ‘missionary’ spirit that 
gave Negro education its initial im- 
petus; it was men like Armstrong who 
pointed the way and blazed a trail for 
you to follow ? 

“T know, I know,” he interrupted, 
“and we owe them a debt of eternal 
gratitude. But that spirit is dead 
now; those who stand in their shoes 
do not accept us as equals, even after 
we have proved that we can rise to 
their level intellectually and culturally. 
Consider the attitude of many people 
in this state, for instance; the greater 
our educational progress, the more 
would they aggravate the distinction 
between the races, on the plea that this 
is necessary to counter-balance the in- 
creasing self-respect and self-confidence 
that are the inevitable fruits of edu- 
cating the Negro. It is the same cry 
that is raised against the ‘Missionary 
school’ student, all over the world— 
‘Educate the lower races, and they be- 
gin to forget their place’. Is it worth 
while training our boys and girls in 
public schools along lines that are only 
going to increase their burden and 
more cruelly hurt their racial pride? 
We are twelve million people. Every 
year our school boys and girls are less 
and less inclined to go on farms or in 
trades, because they are being educated 
for vocations that are less strenuous 
and more ‘respectable’;” then with a 
deprecatory gesture, as if further com- 
ment was unnecessary, he said “But 
there, you know what is going to hap- 
pen.” 

Yes, I knew. And I knew too that 
the argument was heading for the in- 
evitable dead-lock from which we seek 
to escape by saying, “Yes, it is a great 
and pressing problem, but the Negro 
must work out his own salvation. Both 
white and Negro are caught in a con- 
dition over which neither has any con- 
trol.” Or, by way of a change, we 
may say, “Let him trust to the inex- 
orable laws of evolution, which, 
sooner or later, bring individuals and 
races into their birth-right.” 

My train of thought was interrupted 
by a faint whistle, still a long way off. 
Darkness had fallen, unpreceded by 
twilight, and long deep shadows were 
imprinted on the track. We walked 
slowly up and down the platform. 

“There are certain influences and 
forces at work which hold the germ 
of solution, I firmly believe,” I began, 
in anticipation of leading my friend 
to consider a more constructive phase 
of the problem. 

“You mean religion?” He gave me 
a quick look, and one which warned 
me that I must be careful of my an- 
swer. 

“Too broad a term,” I replied, af- 
ter a moment’s thought. 

“Ah!” Both satisfaction and relief 





were expressed in the word, 

“No, religion is not the word to ug 
under the circumstances; it means too 
little in these days. But a literal jp. 
terpretation of Christ’s teaching would 
solve the problem. 

“Which means that the Negro mus 
not look to any ‘church’ for social and 
material salvation,” he added quickly, 

“The sooner he throws over that 
hope, the better,” I answered, then 
continued, “for the enlightened spirit. 
ual consciousness which will bring 
about complete emancipation for al] 
colored peoples, will split the organized 
church bodies more completely than 
any Fundamentalist or Modernist 
movement has ever done.”’ 

A beam of white light swept by and 
the train came thundering into the 
depot. Lights swung from the rear 
car as baggage and freight were loaded 
and unloaded. We walked leisurely 
towards the cars as there was enough 
baggage to load, to keep us waiting 
for five or ten minutes at least. 

“Your last remark interests me very 
much,” I said “and I would like to 
pursue this line of thought. Remember 
this, that as long as men can get to- 
gether and discuss frankly and sym- 
pathetically these matters, with a sin- 
cere desire to do the right thing, we 
are getting nearer and nearer to the 
ideal. Thank God there is no law 
that can keep us apart ™ 

“All aboard!” shouted the con- 
ductor. 

We boarded the train and [ led the 
way to the car, but turned suddenly as 
my friend said, “Good-bye; this has 
indeed been a great pleasure, and 


” 





“But we haven't finished! we've 
got another hour together ——” | 
stopped; the Negro teacher was smil- 
ing, as he said, quietly, “You've for- 
gotten; there is a law that keeps us 
apart.” 

Yes, I had forgotten; during the 
time we had been talking, I had lost 
the Negro, in the Man. I held out 
my hand, and as we looked into each 
other’s faces, I think we both had one 
of those rare and fleeting glimpses of 
Truth, and knew of a certainty, that 
God had made of all men, one flesh. 
Then with another bright smile, he 
left me and walked through to the 
“Jim Crow” car. 

I walked into my car and looked 
around for a quiet seat. Some farm- 
ers were loudly discussing a murder 
case, their remarks being punctuated 
by spitting tobacco juice over the floor; 
four youths were playing cards; a com- 
mercial traveler was snoring in a Cor- 
ner, while three other men in the same 
section were arguing against Prohibi- 
tion. A sad-eyed woman looked stead-

WENTY-FOUR YEARS ago a 
few friends and relatives gath- 
ered at the home of Mr. and Mrs. 
Walter Grimes for the purpose of 
finding a way to band themselves 
closer together and improve the com- 
ing generation by giving them the 
opportunities they were deprived of. 
Out of this meeting resulted the club 
that now meets every three weeks. It 
has to be something real big to cause 
a meeting to be postponed. 

These people gathered on the night 
of September the twenty-ninth, right 
in the heart of the beautiful Wiscon- 
sin fall season. Mrs. Oliver Davis of 
Madison suggested the name, “Autumn 
Leaf”, and that name has been carried 
ever since. The regular procedure of 
starting a club was followed, a con- 
stitution drawn and officers elected. A 
committee was appointed to appeal to 
the state for a charter which was 
granted in October of 1906. 

The club meets every three weeks in 
rotation at the various member’s 
homes. After the meeting a short pe- 
riod is usually devoted to the great all- 
American pastime, “gossip”. Also 
during this period the hostess is busy 
preparing a lunch which has played an 
important part in the existence of the 
club. The first meeting in the month 
is purely a business meeting in which 
problems of interest to improving of 
general conditions of the club and its 
members are discussed. If there is any 
sickness or sorrow in the community, 
provision is always made to see about 
it. When more than one meeting 
occurs in a month this is a pleasure 
one. The program committee always 
has a varied program to offer and top- 
ics of the present day are talked over. 

Lancaster is located eighty-five miles 
southwest of Madison, Wisconsin, and 
thirty miles from Dubuque, Towa. 
There were at one time around two 
hundred colored people living in this 
immediate part of the State. Today 
there are only twenty-four residents in 
Lancaster and vicinity. The youngest 
is six, and the oldest is at the grand 
old age of ninety. Adventure, oppor- 
tunity, matrimony, and death have 
told very hard on our group. 

_ This club has formed itself so firmly 
in our hearts that we use it as our offi- 
cial organ here. The citizens of Lan- 
caster respect its members and the 
club is also quite widely known 
throughout the southwestern part of 
the state. The big reason for this is 
that every year they stage a big “Bar- 
beque and Bowery”, on the Thomas 


April, 1930 


The Autumn Leaf Club 


By EVERETT W. GRIMES 


Much has been written of the 
Negro in the South and of the 
city Negro in the North; but this 


is a simple account of colored folk 
in a country district of the North, 
and what they do and think. 





Greene farm, six miles southwest of 
the town, in what used to be the cen- 
ter of the colored population here. 
There are no colored people living 
closer than the above mentioned two 
cities and they rally to help us put 
over what we call the biggest day in 
the year. This is usually held on or 
near August the fourth, and always 
draws a big crowd. Sometimes there 
are over three thousand people. 

A family dinner is held at noon, a 
program of the best talent is put on in 
the afternoon, and at night is the big 
bowery dance. A _ lively orchestra 
furnishes the music and everybody for- 
gets the cares of life for a period of 
four hours. This past year the Club 
scored another triumph. Mr. George 
Abernathy and his “Royal Knights” of 
Milwaukee, furnished the music, and 
thus for the first time a colored or- 
chestra played in Lancaster. Through- 
out the afternoon and evening the 
crowd may have their choice of bar- 
bequed pork, beef, or chicken, cooked 
by Joseph Grimes. He and another 
also put on several barbeques through- 
out the country at various times dur- 
ing the summer season. A refresh- 
ment stand is erected, and Dick Lewis 
and his helpers are kept real busy dis- 
pensing candy, cigars, soft drinks and 
ice-cream. In the years that this pic- 
nic has been held there has never been 
any disorder, which we feel is quite a 
record. 

The present residents of Lancaster 
are living a typical home life as one 
would expect in a country town. There 
are no factories or industries to offer 
employment. Farm labor, odd jobs 
about town are all a man can get. 
Some men however, have good records 
of service. C. E. Shepard has been 
with a hardware firm for over twenty- 
five years. Joseph M. Grimes has 
been with a family doing housework 
for over eighteen years, and S. C. Craig 
has a good record for janitor service 
in the various churches and schools. 
Some of the women are employed in 
private homes, some do catering for 
parties among the best people here, and 
their ability is greatly respected in that 
line. 


‘There at one time was a colored 
church here but it was a log structure 
and was taken down in 1923, after 
most of the people had joined churches 
in town. A very nice building was 
erected on the church site and is used 
only to house tools or in case of bad 
weather during a funeral. This build- 
ing and cemetery are kept up from the 
fund collected at the picnics and club 
treasury. 

In most clubs finance plays an im- 
portant part, but in ours the dues are 
small and yet they cover all of our de- 
sires. If there is any need for funds, 
a supper, basket social or bazaar is 
held and we try to give our kind help- 
ers full value for their money. 

The Autumn Leaf Club boasts of 
the following records: 

Ten graduates of the Lancaster 
High School, and twenty-four grad- 
uates of grade schools. In high school, 
the boys all made good records in ath- 
letics. 

Four active service men in the 
World War. 

Six active service men in previous 
wars, one of whom is still living, Mr. 
Thomas Greene, who is now ninety 
years of age. 

In the business world we can count 
dentists, garage owners, restaurant 
proprietors and owners, four school 
teachers, tailors, club stewards, and 
two of our group have enviable records 
and positions on the Rock Island and 
Northwestern Railroads. 

Sunday is quite a big day here, as it 
is usually a get-together day. There 
are sometimes out-of-town friends call- 
ing on some one, and everybody has to 
see them before they make their de- 
parture. Every home has a telephone 
or automobile so it is no trouble to get 
all at one home in a very short time. 

The present charter members have 
so instilled the spirit in the younger 
members that all are anxious to stick 
until the twenty-five years are over. 
Whether it will continue is up to the 
group entirely, but at present we do 
not see how we can drop such an im- 
portant thing. A big celebration is 
being planned and we want to make 
it the biggest reunion ever held here in 
Lancaster. 

We are always willing to do what 
we can for the benefit of our race and 
take an active interest in the happen- 
ings of the outside world, and if called 
upon we will not fail in our part. 
There is no through transportation 
here, but some family is always willing 
to accommodate any strangers.

The 369th Infantry, New York National 


Guard 


By WILMER F. LUCAS, Captain-Adjutant 


HE FIFTEENTH REGI- 

MENT, New York Guard, 
came into existence in 1915 by legis- 
lative act. This was the first Negro 
unit of the National Guard of the 
State. Prior to the passing of a law 
prohibiting the bearing of arms by in- 
dependent military bodies there ex- 
isted several semi-military companies 
such as the Skidmore and Lincoln 
Guards. Colonel William Hayward 
organized the regiment in 1916 and 
led it to France in 1917.* Between the 
time of its official recognition as a Na- 
tional Guard regiment on April 17, 
1917, and its arrival in France in De- 
cember 1917, it performed duty guard- 


ing cantonments under construction 
and public utilities in the Eastern De- 
partment. It trained at Camp Wads- 
worth, Camp Dix, Camp Mills, Camp 
Whitman and in the streets of New 
York. The war record of the regi- 
ment is unique and can never be for- 
gotten. 

It enjoys the distinction of being the 
only American unit to have served 


completely under French command 
throughout the entire war. It was the 
only New York organization that 


went to France under its own State 
designation, and that carried State 
Colors throughout its entire service. 
As a combat regiment it was attached 
to the 16th Division, 8th Corps of the 


* There was delay in organizing the regiment 
because Governor Smith refused to appoint a 
Negro Colonel [Editor].

16lst Division. It was redesignated 
the 369th Infantry toward the close 
of the war, which was the normal des- 
ignation of a regiment in the 185th 
Brigade, 93rd Division, A. E. F., but 
continued its service with the French. 
Its colors were decorated with the 
Croix de Guerre for gallant conduct 
in action during the Meuse-Argonne 
offensive in September 1918. Its per- 


Officers of the Regiment. 


sonnel received 191 decorations, 
United States and French, and through 
the courtesy of the French was the 
first unit of the Allied Armies to reach 
the Rhine. Unofficial records quote 
its casualties as 279 killed in action 
and 737 wounded with a record of 
191 days of continuous fighting. 
With such a war record the present 
369th Infantry, New York National 
Guard, has a raison d’etre equal to any 
regiment of the National Guard that 
carried on during the war. The back- 
ground of the present regiment was 
established and kept alive by Colonel 
William J. Schieffelin while the main 
body was in France. Colonel Arthur 
W. Little succeeded Colonel Schief- 
felin in command. An able soldier 
who had served with the regiment dur- 
ing the war as Captain and Regimental 


Adjutant under Colonel Hayward, and 
later as Major in command of a bat- 
talion, Colonel Little gave his undj- 
vided energy to the successful procure- 
ment of the present modern drill hall 
which now houses the regiment. With 
the aid of a favorable City administra- 
tion, Colonel Little saw the undertak- 
ing through to its completion, and to- 
day the present 369th Infantry car- 
ries on its armory training in a drill 
hall of approximately 199,626 square 
feet—half a City block—which cost 
about $400,000. 

In May 1925, Colonel William A. 
Taylor was placed in command of the 
369th Infantry, N. Y. N. G. His 





advent was the beginning of what he 
has since remarked to be the most val- 
uable and enjoyable experience of his 
military career. He entered upon his 
duties as a temporary assignee—chosen 
from the State Staff on which he was 
Inspector General. He came well 
equipped to put the regiment over, for 
his experience covered 27 years as @ 
soldier in the New York National 
Guard and 16 years as an officer. He 
was graduated from the Field Off- 
cers’ School at Fort Leavenworth, 
Kansas; commanded the Third Off- 
cers’ Training School of the 27th Di- 
vision at Camp Wadsworth, Spartan- 
burg, S. C., and was one of the few 
officers of the National Guard offered 
the privilege of taking the course 0 
training at the Army War College. 
During the war he commanded the

Colonel W. A. Taylor 


106th Infantry, N. Y. N. G., part of 
the 27th Division. Aside from his 
wide experience, Colonel Taylor has 
an outstanding reputation in the mili- 
tary establishment of the National 
Guard as a student of soldiers, firm 
but fair, well informed in knowledge 
and requirements of the military, but 
withal a good judge of those human 
attributes which make for confidence, 
high esprit de corps, and loyalty, on 
the part of his subordinates toward 
him. 


At the time Colonel Taylor assumed 
his duties of command the state of 
morale of the regiment was of neces- 
sity low, chiefly because of its expe- 
rience of having had inadequate train- 
ing facilities. Its organization was 
far short of conformity with the pre- 
scribed organization of an infantry 
regiment, because of a shortage of 
capable Line, Field and Staff man- 
power. To-day the regiment is well 
on the way toward making a peace- 
time history, as precious as its war rec- 
ord. It partakes of the same training 
prescribed for all Infantry regiments 
of the National Guard of the State 
and special privileges are not sought. 

The average strength of the regi- 
ment has reached a point where for the 
past two years it has maintained itself 
within 614 per cent of the total num- 
ber of men allowed. In many of the 
companies of the regiment waiting 
lists have been established, and sys- 
tems of critical selection of recruits 
have been necessary, because the appli- 
cations have exceeded the recruiting 
strength of the company as set forth 
in orders. The average attendance of 
the regiment has increased from 40.3 
per cent in 1925 to 80.2 per cent for 
the drill year ending September 30, 
1929. This increase in attendance ac- 
cording to standards set up by Na- 


April, 1930 


tional Guard Headquarters has taken 
the regiment out of the unsatisfactory 
class in this respect and placed it per- 
manently in the very satisfactory class. 

The regiment achieved in Septem- 
ber 1928 the honor position in the at- 
tendance ratings of all the units of the 
National Guard by having the highest 
percentage of attendance for the 
month. During the last period of 
field training (September, 1929) the 
average attendance of the regiment 
was over 90 per cent, which placed it 
in the excellent class in this respect. 
The turn-over of the regiment since 
1925 has decreased from 17.8 per cent 
to 4.2 per cent. This decrease has re- 
flected itself in the training improve- 
ments of the entire command and the 
general efficiency of its non-commis- 
sioned personnel. 

Briefly taking a word of. comment 
from the official reports of the Federal 
Inspectors during field duty each vear 
since 1925 we note: 1925. ‘The regi- 
ment concentrated its efforts during 
the entire tour to develop combat com- 
munications, with most satisfactory re- 
sults.” 


“Camp sanitation was excellent. 
The work of the medical detachment 
was highly satisfactory.” 

1926. ‘The 369th Infantry, N. Y. 
N. G., is to be commended during this 
tour of camp duty for the honest, will- 
ing and untiring effort made by practi- 
cally all its officers and men, to im- 
prove their own efficiency and that of 
the regiment. “The improvement it 
made while in camp should be a 
source of satisfaction and pride to all 
its members. Its discipline and order- 
liness in camp was very satisfactory. 
The regiment should be especially 
commended for qualifying more ex- 
pert bayonet men than any other regi- 
ment in the New York National 
Guard.” 


1927. “Very Satisfactory Ratings.” 





1929. “Colonel William ‘Taylor 
is commended for the excellent disci- 
pline, military courtesy, generally fine 
appearance of the regiment. His in- 
terest and wholehearted co-operation 
in connection with all training and ad- 
ministration matters is worthy of spe- 
cial commendation.” 

The armory drill training of the 
regiment which runs from October to 
September is always intensive. Aside 
from the definitely set forth periods 
of training as called for by the Regi- 
mental Training Schedules, the Arm- 
ory drill period points toward the cred- 
itable fulfilment of two inspection ob- 
jectives. These objectives are the An- 
nual Armory Inspection, which takes 
place some time between January and 
April of each year, and the Annual 
‘Your of Field Duty during the month 
of September. 


As a feature of the armory drill pe- 
riods, regimental reviews are held at 
intervals. These reviews offer oppor- 
tunity for demonstration to the citi- 
zens of the community the efficiency 
and training of the regiment in cere- 
monies. Company and battalion effi- 
ciencies have also been demonstrated by 
machine gun exercises and intra-regi- 
mental athletic competitions. The so- 
cial aspect of the review has also furn- 
ished welcomed diversions for both of- 
ficers and men and their friends. 

The Governor of the State of New 
York reviewed the regiment during its 
last camp tour, and his commendations 
of the showing of the regiment were 
received in the following letter to 
Colonel Taylor: 

“It has not been my practice to send 
commendatory letters to the com- 
manding officers of the military and 
naval units of the State, that I have re- 
viewed during the summer. 

“T am making an exception in the 
case of the 369th Regiment, however, 
on account of the exceptional efficiency

nse 












































displayed throughout the ceremonies at 
Peekskill, last Sunday. Both officers 
and soldiers indicated a very high state 
of morale, excellent precision, and an 
interest in their personal appearance, 
which was most gratifying to me.”’ 
Perhaps the most serious considera- 
tion in the constructive upbuilding of 
the regiment is the selection of the 
proper officer personnel. ‘This phase of 
the organization and growth of the 
military establishment requires careful 
consideration because of the _per- 
manency which should attach itself to 
the appointment of an officer and the 
limitations which obtain in respect to 
his further re-assignment to other 
commands. The nominating officer 
must keep ever in mind the likelihood 
and necessity for his officers develop- 
ing with the progress of his command. 
Since 1925 the opportunity has been 
given 80 non-commissioned officers and 
enlisted men of the regiment to become 
officer candidates. Approximately 55 
of these men have earned commissions 
as Second Lieutenants. Several have 
since earned promotion to First Lieu- 
tenants, and in three instances they 
have attained the rank of Captain, now 
commanding companies. - The follow- 
ing table is interesting to note in re- 
spect to the development of the pres- 


ent officer personnel of the regiment 
since 1925: 


The L 


HE Industrial and Commercial 

Union of South Africa was the 
first native trade union of any im- 
portance in that country. It had once 
about 60,000 members and was organ- 
ized during a dock strike in Capetown 
in 1920 by a band of natives with one 
or two European Socialists assisting 
them. The Union has shown sur- 
prising vitality and its initial success 
was due to the energy and ability of 
Clements Kadalie, a Nyasaland na- 
tive. 

In 1927, Kadalie came to England 
to study trade union technique; to se- 
cure afhliation for the I. C. U. with 
the Amsterdam International Federa- 
tion of Trade Unions; and finally, to 
get from British Trade Unionists such 
assistance as he had been unable to ob- 
tain from Europeans and South Afri- 
cans. His three objects were achieved. 
The I. C. U. became affiliated with 
the Amsterdam International Federa- 
tion of Trade Unions. Kadalie studied

Most of the increase in officer per- 
sonnel among the line officers has been 
by promotion from the ranks of the 
officer candidates and from the already 
existing officer personnel within the 
regiment. This policy has proven a 
healthy one and energetic and promis- 
ing officer material has been developed 
and is making good. While this policy 
of promotion within the ranks has 
been effective, a large portion of con- 
sideration has also been given to for- 
mer officérs of the war who have ap- 
plied for assignments to the regiment, 
whenever their qualifications were ac- 
ceptable and they were able to meet the 
requirements of a fair examination. 

Recently the plans for the comple- 
tion of the housing of the regiment 
have become a reality. Through the 
ceaseless effort of Colonel Taylor and 
the support of officials of the City Ad- 
ministration, an appropriation of 
$1,053,000 has been made, and a new

Austria, Germany, Holland and Eng-

extraordinary quickness and_ ability. 
He had intended to visit America, but 
there was probably some difficulty 
about his passport visé and he was sud- 
denly recalled to South Africa by dis- 
quieting news concerning his organiza- 
tion. 

During his absence, Champion, a 
Zulu, who had been left in charge, mis- 
appropriated funds and tried to start 
an independent movement in Natal. 
Kadalie made arrangements for hav- 
ing an English trade union leader sent 
out to South Africa to help him in re- 
organization, and hurried home. He 
arrived in South Africa to find the 
disintegration even worse than he had 
feared. The Central Office was in 
chaos. Many branches were disband- 
ing, while the Herzog Government 
was prepared to launch its four Na- 
tive Bills upon the country and was 





soon be under the course ot construc- 
tion. It will probably be completed 
within the early part of the year 193). 
The building is to be the most mod. 
ern administrative building housing 
any regiment in the State of Ney 
York. It will front on Fifth Avenue. 
running back 220 feet on 142nd Street. 
and 143rd Street and adjoin the present 
Armory drill hall. The approach to 
the entrance of the new building on 
Fifth Avenue will have a magnificent 
layout. Each company will have its 
own quarters; a gymnasium has been 
provided for; a bowling alley, squad 
rooms, well-equipped medical rooms 
and facilities, an officers’ and enlisted 
men’s mess, reception rooms, a trophy 
room, adequate shower bath facilities 
for the entire regiment and a moderp- 
ized storage space for the proper keep- 
ing of regimental property and equip- 
ment. 

Before another year has elapsed the 
regiment will probably be equipped 
with its official insignia which was 
adopted and approved by the War De- 
partment on April 5th, 1923. 

The future of the regiment has been 
well assured by the development of a 
constructive program. No longer is 
there any question as to the rightful 
place of the regiment among the first 
ranks of the National Guard of the 
State of New York.

tightening the Pass laws. 
tion was critical. 

The Trade Union Congress ot 
South Africa gave Kadalie no help but 
offers of support came from the Com- 
munists. Kadalie had no theoretic 
aversion to Communism, but he knew 
that race prejudice in South Africa 
was so bitter, and the very existence 
of a native trade union so precarious 
and the Government so hostile, that 
an alliance of Negroes and Commun- 
ists would be dangerous. All of his 
letters and cables to Europe were 
opened and read by the Government, 
but, nevertheless, his English friends 
secured the services of W. G. Ball- 
inger, a fine and intelligent young 
white Scotchman with wide trade 
union experience and educated at the 
International Labor College at Oslo. 

After weeks of delay for his pass 
port, he sailed for South Africa in the 
summer of 1928. He was promptly 
arrested on his arrival, but eventually

was allowed to land. The I. os 
was in pitiful confusion. ‘The de- 
falcations of its officials had led to 
lawsuits which European lawyers were 
exploiting for their own success. The 
bills amounted to many thousand 
pounds. Champion had broken away 
completely and formed an independent 
organization. The Central Office was 
bankrupt and only a loan from a 
European woman prevented the law- 
vers from seizing the equipment. 

’ Ballinger went to work. He found 
the remaining officials superbly loyal. 
They worked for weeks without salary 
under threat of arrest, without rest 
and without complaint. They re-or- 
ganized the branches; systematized 
the records; amended the Constitution. 
For a long time, Kadalie worked loy- 
ally with them, but he was a brilliant 
and nervous man. He had been ac- 
customed for a long time to having 
his own way. He found advice gall- 
ing. He was extravagant and with 
big ideas, and Ballinger’s Scotch econ- 
omy exasperated him. He began to 
drink heavily. Once, he was arrested 
for a wild speech at a meeting while 
drunk. Ballinger bailed him out. Then 
he had trouble with his wife, and 
finally, was given a year’s leave of ab- 
sence on half pay so as to pull himself 
together. This did no good. He was 
a man of energy and idleness exasper- 


ated him. His vanity was hurt. He 
finally resigned from the I. C. U. and 
started a rival organization. 

Meantime, the original I. C. U. 
goes on. It is the only constitutional 
South Africa native union. It draws 
up reports; presents cases before Wage 
Boards ; conducts legal defense; and is 
slowly re-establishing itself as the bal- 
ance between the industrialized native 
and exploitation. There is desperate 
need for such a union but there are 
also desperate difficulties. Debts are 
being slowly paid but it will be months 
before the Central Office is really sol- 
vent. England has sent about $3,000 
to tide over immediate expenses; Am- 
sterdam has sent $500. But Balling- 
er’s own salary has been spent largely 
in helping support officials who have 
worked under starvation conditions un- 
til debts are paid. 

Meantime, the government which is 
seeking support for its policy of dis- 
franchising the Capetown natives, has 
lifted the cry of Communism in Natal. 
It took advantage of a disturbance in 
Durban to charge the I. C. U. with 
all native unrest and it is using this 
strike to beat the natives and the I. C. 
U. in particular. If the Government 
can succeed in declaring the natives to 
be potential Communists under the 
influence of irresponsible agitators, 
they can get from the legislative as- 


sembly unrestricted legislation of. the 
severest sort. 

In this crisis, one thing is clear: the 
I. C. U. must be kept going or there 
will be nothing to stand between the 
natives and unlicensed exploitation. 
To keep the Union going means finan- 
cial help. The Amsterdam Interna- 
tional is unable to do more. The Brit- 
ish Trade Unions in these hard times 
can do little, and the rest are afraid 
of the disreputable connections of the 
I.C. U. The I. C. U. is, therefore, 
appealing to the United States to help 
them raise $10,000 or less for this 
great work. The Negro leaders of 
South Africa are not angels. If they 
were, they would not need help. The 
plight of the I. C. U. is partly their 
own fault, but their faults were in- 
evitable on account of their lack of 
opportunity; their position of sub- 
servience; their isolation and their en- 
forced ignorance. Out of confusions 


of this sort great movements are born. 
Who will help? 





The above narrative is taken almost 
word for word from the Report of an 
English woman who has been in South 
Africa and who is connected with the 
trade unions. Her letter was sent to 
Oswald Garrison Villard and through 
him has come to us. We are publish- 
ing it for the benefit of those who 
ought to know. 


“Jim-Crowin g Nurses 


WRITE you this letter after days 

and weeks of urging by my friends, 
who number many among the leaders 
and persons of note in this community, 
to explain to you the exact sitvation of 
the entering of Negro women as stu- 
dent nurses in the Highland Hospital 
for nurse training of this (Alameda) 
county of California. 

In June, 1923, there came to me by 
special delivery this letter to a colored 
applicant for nurse training: 

“In answer to yours of June 11th 
asking for admission to our school for 
Nurses, please note that it is impos- 
sible for me to consider your applica- 
tion, This matter was taken up some 
time ago and definitely settled. 

“Trusting that you may realize that 
you cannot enter our school and with 
best wishes I am 

Yours very truly, 
J. E. Cameron, R. N., 


Superintendent of Nurses.” 


On this letter I based the right to 
fight to have Negro students enter the 
county hospital, a tax paid institution, 


April, 1930 


to training such as other races were 
allowed, since the laws of the State of 
California require no racial qualifica- 
tions. 

Being a trained social worker and 
one who has traveled extensively, and 
having received the major part of my 
education and experience in the South- 
ern part of the United States, I col- 
lected all data available, held many 
conferences with judges and district at- 
torneys of this county, as well as with 
many laymen, especially with the 
wealthy whites. 

After having everything documented, 
I presented the facts in case form to the 
Alameda County League of Colored 
Women Voters. It took several 
months to do this. This organization 
had formed a committee known as the 
Hospital Committee, and I was elected 
chairman. Then the fight was on. I 
was soon introduced to a medical di- 
rector of institutions, who hated the 
sight of Negroes other than in the 
capacity of menial labor. This direc- 
tor was coarse and insulting and had 
no regard for Negro womanhood ; then 


came the Institutions Commission— 
some 14 persons, many individually 
nice to Negroes, but collectively they 
were all influenced by the medical di- 
rector, and here I sensed the tinge of 
segregation in the form of ‘“‘buck pass- 
ing’. This, I was prepared for. I 
had in advance written to the super- 
intendent of nurses of the Los Angeles 
County Training School for Nurses 
who had admitted a Negro. student in 
1919. The answer from Los Angeles 
County was favorable to the colored 
student. 

I worked on quietly, through politi- 
cal campaigns with promises of each 
County Supervisor elected to use his 
influence to have the Negro student 
enter. 

In 1926 came the opening of the 
New Highland Hospital (one million 
eight hundred thousand dollars), the 
medical director still holding out that 
the Negro student should not enter, 
using any silly thing for an excuse. In 
1927 both the medical director and the 
superintendent of nurses resigned from

SPRINGFIELD, MASS., JUNE, 
I930 
HEN the National Association 


for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People assembles on June 25th in 
Springfield, Massachusetts, in its 
twenty-first Annual Spring ‘Confer- 
ence, the event will be more than a 
coming together of white and colored 
people with common interests from 
all parts of the country. The Confer- 
ence will represent a focus of months 
of effort. It will be the culmination 
of the Moorfield Storey-Louis Mar- 
shall Campaign, to do honor to the 
work of the dead leaders and insure 
its being carried on in a manner worthy 
of the efforts they gave. 


Before the culminating meeting in 
Springfield on the night of July 1, 
many other meetings of various kinds 
will have been held in cities through- 
out the country. Branches are putting 
forth unusual efforts this year to make 
known the pioneer work the Associa- 
tion has done and still is doing. They 
are calling to membership on their 
campaign committees prominent citi- 
zens of both races. The aid of editors 
is being enlisted, both white and col- 
ored. And new activities are being 
inaugurated to bring home to all 
groups what the Association and _ its 
leaders have stood for. 


Besides the usual popularity con- 
tests, of babies, and adults, and the 
dances, teas, sales, tournaments, musi- 
cal evenings and other forms of en- 
tertainment that have been a part of 
campaigns in past years, the branches 
in many cities are instituting a new 
form of contest. It is one that is de- 
signed to interest young people in the 
N. A. A. C. P. work and program. 
Essay contests are to be held among 
junior members of the N. A. A. C. P. 
on the work of Moorfield Storey, the 
Association’s first and only President, 
and its frequent champion before the 
U.S. Supreme Court, the winner to re- 
ceive a photograph of this leader. All 
this celebration is to signalize the N. 
A. A. C. P. coming-of-age, the com- 
pletion of its twenty-first year. 

It is appropriate that the Associa- 
tion’s coming-of-age should be cele- 
brated in the heart of a state which 
furnished much of the moral backbone 
of the movement that freed the nation 
of slavery. For Massachusetts gave 
to the nation not only abolitionists who 
sharpened the issue contested in the

THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 





Civil War; but troops and _ leaders, 
one of whom laid down his life lead- 
ing colored Americans fighting for 
their freedom in battle. After the 
war, it sent to the South brave men 
and women who dared ostracism, 
threats, and humiliation, in order to 
bring to the freedom and their chil- 
dren the weapon of education. 


In coming to Massachusetts and to 
Springfield, therefore, the Association 
is in a sense coming home. And that 
feeling is intensified by the warmth 
of welcome being prepared by the peo- 
ple of Springfield and their confidence 
that this Conference of the N. A. A. 
C. P. from June 25 to July 2, will 
be an event of national importance. 


For this confidence, there are the 
best of grounds. There is the record 
of past N. A. A. C. P. Conferences 
to fortify it. Gradually, from year 
to year, the Annual Spring Confer- 
ence has been increasing in interest 
and significance for all citizens of 
whatever color. These week-long 
gatherings are something more than a 
convention. They are far more than 
a mere pleasure jaunt, although those 
who have attended some of the Con- 
ferences have vowed they would not 
willingly miss one in the future. 


What the Annual Spring Confer- 
ence of the N. A. A. C. P. has slowly 
come to mean to the nation, is a gath- 
ering where a year’s experience in 
dealing with inter-racial problems is 
pooled and made public; where spe- 
cialists in the various fields of science 
bring their knowledge and experience 
to bear upon those problems; and 
where people from all parts of the 
United States, white and _ colored, 
gather to meet personally, and to learn 
from one another of the expedients in- 
vented and adopted to make the coun- 
try more livable for persons of all races 
and colors. 


In reality the Annual Spring Con- 
ference of the N. A. A. C. P. has 
now become an_ unrivalled public 
forum, whose findings are transmitted 
by telegraph and radio and daily news- 
papers to all parts of the civilized 
world: calling attention to grave 
abuses where they still exist, propos- 
ing remedies and calling attention to 
new experiments tried in various lo- 
calities; and above all, by the presen- 
tation of the Spingarn Medal blazon- 
ing creative achievement during the 
preceding year-—and sometimes during 


mh —__ Be 


a preceding lifetime—by an American 
of African descent. 

In the N. A. A. C. iP. and in its 
Annual Spring Conference, the crea. 
tive vision is focussed on those Amer- 
icans, white and colored, working to- 
gether for the purpose of making race 
relations harmonious and easy rather 
than anarchic and brutal and violent: 
striving to release the creative im- 
pulses of colored Americans and to 
spread popular knowledge of their 
achievements. It is their faith that 
prejudice, as the word implies, is a 
product of prejudgment, of ignorance: 
and that upon increased knowledge 
and understanding must follow in 
creased sympathy and human treat- 
ment, equality of opportunity for peo- 
ple of all groups. 

In the twenty years of its existence, 
accordingly, the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored Peo- 
ple has stressed the accumulation of 
fact and the distribution of such in- 
formation when acquired. In its at- 
tack upon lynching, which reduced the 
number of such crimes from upwards 
of 100 a year to 12 in 1929, the Asso- 
ciation began with investigation, with 
publication of the investigators’ find- 
ings. So it scotched the myth that 
lynchings avenged one crime only, 
crime against women, and showed that 
men and even women were brutally 
done to death for transgressions real or 
fancied against the code that holds 
one group superior because of its skin 
pigmentation and another group in- 
ferior for the same reason. 


Confident in the law of the land, 
and in recourse to the courts which 
interpret that law, the Association has 
enlisted in its aid a number of the 
most distinguished legal minds of the 
country, including the late Moorfield 
Storey, its first and only President; the 
late Louis Marshall, and, in the field 
of criminal law, Clarence Darrow. 
These champions won no less than five 
victories in the United States Supreme 
Court, affirming the fundamental 
rights of all minority groups, as well 
as those of the Negro; and have pat- 
ticipated in innumerable decisive vit 
tories in the lower courts, state and 
federal. 

In the process of building, which is 
its main work, the Association has kept 
constantly in touch with public sentr 
ment. It has written to editors and 
the editors have responded by publish-

ing its letters. It has made public 
stories of progress or of hardship and 
those stories have travelled through 
the world, even to India, Japan, Cey- 
jon and South Africa. Its staff have 
written upwards of twenty books and 
have been contributors to the best 
monthly and weekly magazines not 
alone in America but in England and 
in Europe as well. Yearly the number 
of persons seeking information from 
the N. A. A. C. P. increases. People 
come from Europe, Africa and Asia, 
letters come from students and teach- 
ers, clergymen and writers, scientists 
and artists in all parts of the world. 
And to these the Association makes 
available*the best information it has 
accumulated on the subject of relations 
between the races and the progress be- 
ing made in orderly arrangement of 
those relations. 

The work of the National Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People has become international in its 
scope and, as Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois 
said at its January meeting in New 
York, that work is part of a world- 
wide movement involving all peoples 
of color and all the so-called white 
races. The N. A. A, C. P. in its 
twenty years experience, has come to 
realize that the relations of white and 
colored citizens of the United States 
form only a small segment of a world 
problem. The Association feels that 
in the spirit of its approach to the race 
problems of the United States, the 
world problems of color and race must 
be dealt with, if there is to be eventual 
peace. 

In 1930, the Association will bring 
to Springfield certain specific problems 
for discussion. The era is past in which 
it could be claimed that the Negro had 





















A pril, 1930 


not a soul, was not a man. The era 
is swiftly passing in which it can be 
claimed that he is incapable of any 
known level of culture achieved by 
members of any other race group. But 
the N. A. A. C. P. is still concerned 
with the treatment of the Negro as 
citizens, with the problem of obtain- 
ing for him equality under the law and 
in the national life. 

The Association is fighting in the 
highest courts of the land, efforts to 
bar the Negro from primary elections 
in Southern states. At the moment of 
writing, four such contests are being 
waged, originating in Texas, Virginia, 
Florida and Arkansas. The Associa- 
tion is facing the problems offered by 
the Jim Crow system with its denial of 
opportunity and its abuses. It is con- 
sidering, as it has long considered, the 
question of equality of educational op- 
portunity, of equal and just treatment 
in the courts, of protecting the hum- 
blest colored man from exploitation 
and mistreatment. It is everlastingly 
concerned with creating a public sen- 
timent which shall insure for the Ne- 
gro what President Roosevelt named 
the square deal. 

Inevitably in its contact with a cross 
section of all the problems of the mod- 
ern world as they affect colored Amer- 
icans, the Association has been con- 
fronted with the question of labor. It 
has found Negroes discriminated 
against on the job and, too often, ex- 
cluded from labor unions affiliated 
with the American Federation of La- 
bor. That question assumes particu- 
lar significance this year in view of the 
Federation’s announced intention to 
conduct an_ intensive unionization 
campaign in the Southern states where 
Negroes are most numerous. 


That question of the Negro and 
union labor is one of the most pressing 
and important which the N. A. A. C. 
P. will discuss at its twenty-first an- 
nual Spring Conference in Springfield, 
Massachusetts. For of what use is it 
to the Negro to be emancipated and a 
citizen, if he is barred from the work 
he can do competently and must either 
starve or turn to the most menial 
forms of day labor, being discrimi- 
nated against even here. 

The Negro and his relations with 
union labor, forms perhaps the most 
immediate salient of the problem of 
the entire economic life of the Negro. 
It is one which the Association has 
been studying for some years. It is 
one which the Association has called to 
the attention of the American Federa- 
tion of Labor and invited the Federa- 
tion to investigate jointly with the 
N. A. A. C. P. To date results have 
been scanty. At its annual meetings 
the A. F. of L. has passed a formal 
resolution urging equality of treatment 
for Negro workers. But constituent 
international unions of the Federation 
still exclude the Negro formally, or in- 
formally. So do locals of interna- 
tional unions which profess to accord 
the Negro equality of treatment. 
That is one of the questions vital to 
unionization and to the economic or- 
der which the Association intends to 
discuss fully and frankly in Spring- 
field, Massachusetts. And in proceed- 
ings in that city, from June 25 to 
July 2, may be expected to be of vital 
interest to all those concerned for the 
welfare of their country and its treat- 
ment of all groups of citizens within 
its borders.

Johnson C. Smith University

66] T is conceivable that there remain 

among us many who are out of 
sympathy with the cause of higher edu- 
cation for Negroes; who take the easy 
and old-fashioned attitude that the 
Negro was ordained specifically for the 
more menial tasks and that to educate 
him is to go against the providential 
grain. Those hereabouts, however, who 
have any knowledge of the excellent 
work and history of the Johnson C. 
Smith University, formerly Biddle, 
who are acquainted with the type of 
college students there, the excellent 
record they have been making in the 
way of self-culture and who are, also, 
so well aware of the pleasant, cordial 
and constructive relations that have ex- 
isted between the citizenship of Char- 
lotte and the executives of that insti- 
tution, and the dignity and decorum 
of the students of that college, long ago 
put to rest any fears as to the effect 
higher education has upon Negroes: 
that ‘is, if the situation in general is as 
it is here in specific.” 

So read the last paragraphs of an 
editorial on “Negro Education” in the 
October 12, 1929, issue of The Char- 
lotte News. The News was founded 
in 1865 by W. C. Dowd, the father of 
the present general manager and is a 
leading Southern white daily. 


The excellent work and history of 
Johnson C. Smith show a merging of 
the aid of Southern white men and 
Northern white women to build a 
school in the South for the higher edu- 
tion of Negroes. William R. Meyers 
of Charlotte, a Southern white man 
gave the first eight acres of land for 


President H. L. McCrorey 


The Library 


the school site. Mrs. M. D. Biddle 
of Philadelphia, widow of Major Bid- 
dle of Civil War fame gave liberally 
for the early support of the school. 
The school was originally named Bid- 
dle University in honor of her husband. 
It was chartered by the legislature and 
is now under the Presbyterian Church 
in the United States of America. 

In recent years when higher State 
standards forced schools and so-called 
colleges to qualify or to die, this school 
had a new birth in resources. The late 
James Buchanan Duke of Charlotte, a 
Southern white man, gave the Univer- 
sity over a million dollars in one gift; 
and Mrs. Johnson C. Smith, widow of 
the late Johnson C. Smith of Pitts 
burgh, a Northern white woman, gave 
buildings, endowment, and personal in- 
spiration to the institution. The Uni 
versity is today, per capita of its student 
body, the most richly endowed institu- 
tion for Negroes in the world. C. 0. 
Keuster, Manager of the Charlotte 
Chamber of Commerce announces 
through the newspapers of that city 
that a monument ought to be erected by 
the city of Charlotte on the campus of 
Johnson C. Smith University to Mrs. 
Johnson C. Smith. 

Of the seventy-seven Institutions do- 
ing college work wholly or in part 
among Negroes in the United States, 
Johnson C. Smith University is one. 
Three hundred men of the thirteen 
thousand eight hundred and sixty stu- 
dents in these schools are enrolled at 
Smith in its college of Liberal Arts. It 
has no high school. There are eighteen 
men in the school of Theology. On

Crisis 


Re-Visiting the South 


South by any one who has known 
the South well for many years, is al- 
ways interesting. In respect to the 
Negro there are some signs of prog- 
ress, but the great outstanding phe- 
nomenon is the “stand-pat” condition 
of the South on race relations. Wher- 
ever there is change, there is some eco- 
nomic background for it. For exam- 
ple: when a black man wanted a 
Pullman berth to sleep in from Knox- 
ville to Memphis, it took two days of 
negotiation on the part of the Presi- 
dent of Knoxville College, a white 
man, to get it; and he finally got it for 
these reasons: bus traffic and private 
autos are cutting down railroad pas- 
senger fares so much that there is a 
disposition on the part of the railroad 
companies to find their commercial in- 
terest in stimulating travel on the part 
of colored people. Therefore, when 
application was made to a railroad 
that runs entirely in Tennessee from 
Knoxville to Memphis, they expressed 
regret that they could not sell the col- 
ored man a ticket, relating how some 
white passenger had recently made a 
fuss because they had sold accommo- 
dation to a colored woman. But, they 
said, go over to the Southern Railroad ; 
they can sell to you, because they do 
not journey all the way from Knox- 
ville to Memphis in the state of Ten- 
nessee, but dip down into the corners 
of Alabama and Mississippi en route. 
In other words, because the Southern 
Railroad crosses a state line on this 
journey, it is an interstate fare, even 
though it is sold from one point of the 
state to another. The railways are 
availing themselves of this technicality 
because of their economic need to do 
so. They have pretended never to 
know that point of constitutional law 
before—not even when the journey 
was from one state to a point in an- 
other state. In this case, mark you, 
the Southern only passes through the 
corner of another state, on its way 
Irom one point in a state to another 
point in the same state. If they have 
the right to do this, then it is equally 
right for them to carry Negroes with- 
out Jim Crow from one state to an- 
other. And the only reason they have 
not discovered this railroad right 
earlier, is because it seemed more prof- 
itable heretofore to please the white 
population; it seemed more profitable 
to cater to the prejudice of the whites 
than to stand by the Negro and the 

onstitution. But changed conditions 


April, 1930 


AN occasional trip through the 


By WILLIAM PICKENS 


bring change of morals. The rail- 
roads themselves would have settled 
this point of law in the very begin- 
nings of Jim Crow, if they had seen 
profit in so doing. It would have been 
settled rightly also if when the very 
first interstate Jim Crow was at- 
tempted, there had been in existence 
some powerful defense organization to 
take up the matter for the Negro, as 
there was when residential Jim Crow 
was first attempted. 

If anything dethrones Jim Crow, it 
will be economic causation combined 
with the enforcement of constitutional 
law. A few years ago, the busses run- 
ning out of San Antonio, were oper- 
ated for whites only. Then some 
northern bus company conceived the 
idea of profits in setting up lines “for 
Negroes”. But the lines already in 
operation knew that any bus set in 
motion to carry Negroes could law- 
fully carry such whites as were willing 
to ride with Negroes,—and that any 
new bus line would defend its constitu- 
tional rights to do so. Therefore a 
new bus line for Negroes would be a 
dangerous rival for a line “for white 
people only;” therefore the old lines 
fought and defeated a charter for the 
new proposal and agreed to carry 
Negroes themselves. They carry 
Negroes now, albeit grudgingly and 
in the most uncomfortable seats. They 
are gruff and show Negroes every indi- 
cation that “we don’t want to carry 
you”, by gruffness and discourtesy. 
But that, too, will be changed if ever 
it is seen to be profitable to do so. As 
it is now, Negroes use the busses only 
under the whip of necessity. Polite- 
ness and comfort would greatly in- 
crease their patronage. 

It is becoming increasingly plain 
that one of the greatest economic bur- 
dens to the South is segregation by 
race: in many cases a black man finds 
himself in a half, or two-thirds of a 
railway coach alone for 25 or fifty 
miles or more,—when his individual 
fare can hardly pay for the grease that 
is used on the car trucks for the jour- 
ney. Jim Crow can never become any- 
thing better than an economic handi- 
cap to the whole south, white and 
black. The white population does not 
respect Jim Crow where it seems an 
individual burden to them or where 
it thwarts some present wish of theirs: 
as individuals they invade “the Negro 
side” continually. 

The South is yet a strange mixture 
of confidence and fear on the part of 


the colored population. Courage and 
determination were heartening in such 
places as Hot Springs, Little Rock and 
Pine Bluff in Arkansas; and in Texas 
there was aggressive courage in such 
places as Texarkana, Dallas, San An- 
tonio, Corpus Christi, Houston, Gal- 
veston, in many smaller ‘places. But in 
several large cities even, there was the 
same ancient fear of 20 years ago. In 
some places the leading colored men 
were actually afraid to meet and con- 
fer with a visitor representing the Na- 
tional Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People. In other 
places, they introduced him to the 
audience only as an individual, not 
mentioning his organization, telling 
the audience: ““We do not know what 
his subject is or what he is going to 
talk about,” etc. From some of the 
places they disposed of the matter by 
simply refusing to answer letters,— 
from one or two places, they wrote 
frankly “it can’t be done here”,—and 
in a few places, after having previously 
accepted dates, they got scared by some- 
thing as their preparations progressed, 


and wired a cancellation at the last 


minute. But in many places they 
stood up bravely, and the established 
branches held drives and membership 
renewal campaigns, and completed 
branches, or new primary branch or- 
ganizations were effected in twelve or 
thirteen towns and cities. Texarkana, 
for example, is in one of the meanest 
parts of all the earth, so far as a 
Negro is concerned. But in Texar- 
kana all the worth while colored peo- 
ple,—professional and business men, 
preachers and citizens,—took an active 
part in preparing for a meeting and 
canvassing for memberships, so that it 
was impossible for hostile sentiment to 
prevent them. It is not a feasible task 
to attack and oppress a whole united 
people. In Texarkana, after Mr. 
Shillady was assaulted in Austin, the 
Ku Klux had taken advantage of the 
psychology of the moment and de- 
manded that the Texarkana Branch of 
the Association should disband. The 
branch had refused to do so. That was 
the first victory. Then lately when 
the same class of whites heard that a 
meeting was being prepared for a na- 
tional officer of the organization, they 
inquired “diligently”, as did the agents 
of Herod, just where and when and 
how such a meeting was to be held. If 
they had found only one or two promi- 
nent colored men in it, perhaps they 
would have tried pressure; but finding 


127 








the whole Negro population apparently 
interested, they let it alone,—and Tex- 
arkana staged a great drive and meet- 
ing, enrolling hundreds of members 
and raising much money. 

And in Houston, Tex., where they 
have been fighting cases ever since the 
last stand of the 24th Infantry there, 
they have learned that there is no pro- 
tection in fear, and so they staged the 
greatest meeting that we have seen 
of the kind in the south, many colored 
men pledging $25 a year to legal de- 
fense organization, some paying in cash 
at the meeting. 

The Negroes of the South, of the 
type of the leaders in these cities, are 
gradually impressing upon the whites 
a respect for colored humans. It is 
slow movement, but it is not going 
backwards. 

After passing through many experi- 
ences in Arkansas and Texas, some of 
them considered by the local colored 
people to be really dangerous, it was 
pleasant to the N. A. A. C. P. visitor 
to run across a rare experience in the 
first engagement in Oklahoma. When 
the visitor arrived this little city of 
twenty-odd thousand people, who but 
His Honor the Mayor should come 
forward with the local colored doctor 
to greet him. The mayor is a young 
man, of courage and promise in the 
land, a college graduate, who realizes 
that white people in the south are not 
born “knowing the Negro.” There- 
fore he is trying to learn about them 
and their situation, and he is doing it. 
In Dallas where he practiced law for 
a little while after his graduation from 
law school, he took interest in the 
“Little Theatre” movement among 
Negroes. He is not afraid. He came 
back to his home in Chickasha, Okla- 
homa, and decided to run for mayor. 
His opponent was a wealthy man. The 
young college man promised a square 
deal to everybody, even to Negroes. 





That was supposed to be his finish, but 
he was so convincing that he won. He 
is trying to live up to his promises. He 
is even fighting a great corporation, the 
Rock Island Railroad, for the right to 
cut a drainage channel through the 
part of the town owned by that cor- 
poration, and to improve the sanitation 
of the section where most colored peo- 
ple live. On that very day he telephoned 
to the general counsel of the Rock 
Island in Chicago, that if they did not 
allow the drainage to go through, he 
would do his best to get every Negro 
resident in the district to file damage 
suits against the railroad. 

This young man came out to the 
mass meeting at night and took part 
in an N. A. A. C. P. program, and it 
is worth relating, from the South, that 
he began his address: ‘‘Ladies and gen- 
tlemen,”’ without any undue flourishes 
and accents of patronization. His 
white friends and relatives, a few of 
them, were seated in the auditorium 
listening to him, too. He proclaimed 
himself as belonging to a new order. 
He said that he did not expect his 
uncles and older relatives to see as he 
saw, for they belonged to a different 
society and an earlier environment. He 
regarded colored folk as a part of the 
people of the community, with common 
interests with all the others. He told 
how an excited old white lady had 
stormed into his office when he was 
first installed as mayor, exclaiming in 
terror: “What are you going to do 
about it? what are you going to do 
about it,—the niggers! the niggers are 
taking our section of the town!” And 
he had quietly remarked: “Madam, I 
am not going to do anything about it: 
there is law in the land, and they are 
not violating it. They have a right to 
do what they are doing.” The old 
lady had left his office less excited, but 
a little wiser,—and a heap angrier. 


And the Mayor joined the N. A. A. 


In Fayette County, 


EAR Sirs: 

I am writing in regard to the flag- 
rant discrimination against colored peo- 
ple in the division of public school 
funds of common school district num- 
ber 57 in Fayette County, Texas. To 
show how the school money is divided, 
I shall give you a few facts. The per 
capita apportionment from the state for 
the school year 1927-28 was $15. 
Fayette County also pays a per capita. 
Besides these two apportionments, com- 
mon school district number 57 has a 
local school tax of fifty cents on the 
$100. The state has impartially ap- 
propriated money for both white and 
colored children; but the county super-

intendent, the county board of trustees 
and local board of trustees, in collusion, 
deprive the colored people of their just 
share. The number of white children 
of school age in district number 57, was 
seventy for the school year 1927-28; 
colored, fifty-four. The white school 
with three teachers was taught eight 
months; the colored school with one 
teacher was taught five months. Six 
of the seven trustees of this district are 
in favor of making the same division 
of school funds as for the school year 
1927-28 for the year 1928-29. I am 
the only trustee on the board who is 
in favor of an equitable division of 
funds between whites and blacks. No 


C. P. and subscribed for the Crisis, 
He is 27 years old. He is educated, 
He is brave. It is always our belief 
that the only real progress is in the 
accession of the young,—of the next 
generation: in short, that the greatest 
social reformer is DEATH. When 
people die, we should not feel sad, but 
philosophical. The procession to the 
yrave yard is a triumphal procession — 
for the next generation. This mayor 
is a Democrat,—but what does that 
mean? 

On the whole, the great southwest 
is more illiberal and less progressive 
on the race question than is the south- 
east. Colored people are unlawfully 
barred from Pullmans in Arkansas, 
Texas and Oklahoma. Out of Dallas 
a colored preacher from Chicago had 
to buy two tickets and the drawing 
room to get space in the sleeping car. 

The economic advance of colored 
people in the south is noticeable every- 
where, and would be astounding to 
most people who are not acquainted 
with the situation. In spite of con- 
tinual robbery of their property, they 
are gaining. Even the lodges are be- 
ginning to build institutions and office 
buildings,—hospitals and auditoriums. 
They used to do nothing but take up 
“pass words,” “throw signs’, mostly 
of distress;—and then dole out some- 
thing to a fellow when he was sick 
and have a holiday burying him when 
he was dead. Now they are building 
sanitariums and baths and _ hotels in 
places like Hot Springs, Ark.—and 
great office buildings in centers like 
Houston and Dallas. They are operat- 
ing hospitals and “homes” and are as- 
sisting in the education of the young. 
In other words they are beginning to 
forward the economic and other real 
social interests of the Negro group. 
And solid economic progress is the only 
thing that can ever remove oppression 
and cure prejudice. 





Texas 


colored person is a trustee in this dis- 
trict. I do not know of one in this 
covnty. 

If there is one right above all others 
of the colored people that should be 

ligently upheld, it is their right to a 
just division of the public school 
funds. Since your association has been 
expressly organized for the defense of 
rights of colored people, would it not 
be the proper course for your society 
to investigate the acts of the petty 
school officials of Fayette County who 
violate the Fourteenth Amendment? 
The public school records at LaGrange, 
Fayette County, Texas, need a search- 
ing inquiry.

“Slavery”, by Kathleen Simon, 


slavery in the world. 


es 
THE BROWSING READER | 








Lon- 
don, 1929. ; . 
Mrs. Simon’s study of slavery is 

unfortunate. She is without doubt a 

sincere and well-meaning woman 

She is overcome by the persistence of 

She says: 
“There are certainly in the world 

today at least +,000,000 slaves. There 

are probably many more; their num- 
her may even exceed 6,000,000. But 
in any case, the minimum number of 

4,000,000 persons, held in bondage as 

a saleable property, is established by 

trustworthy evidence. The cry of 

these slaves—the more pathetic because 
it is so largely inarticulate—comes 
ringing across the sandy deserts and 
over the ocean waves to civilization. 

It is a cry for just one thing—Lib- 

erty!” 

Nevertheless, her book amounts to 
an attack on all the slave-holders in 
the world except the British and a 
clean bill of health for them. Her 
contradictions in this respect are extra- 
ordinary. She says: “Slavery takes 
place under British administration no 
longer.” And yet, in the same breath, 
she tells of 200,000 slaves manumitted 
in British Sierra Leone only in 1928; 
of slavery in the Egyptian Sudan 
which Great Britain rules; of slavery 
in Hong-Kong which Great Brit- 
ain owns; of slavery in certain 
parts of India, which Great Britain 
dominates. Her main stress is on the 
slavery in Abyssinia, and there she 
paints a picture that is black indeed if 
true. But it rests unfortunately on 
the testimony of Englishmen, French- 
men and Italians, who are ready to 
pounce upon Abyssinia and cut it in 
sunder whenever they can get the 
chance. Such attacks on dark people 
is always prepared for by high moral 
indignation at some alleged crime. 
Whatever an Englishman says, Lady 
Simon receives at absolute face value, 
but when the King of Abyssinia un- 
dertakes to “secure the complete aboli- 
tion of slavery in all its forms and of 
the slave trade by land and sea,” Lady 
Simon is doubtful. 

Reading her picture of Abyssinia one 
almost fears that this book is a trap 
to lay the groundwork for English 
aggression upon this black country. 
The treatment of the cocoa contro- 
versy between the English and the 
Portuguese i is also not satisfactory. “It 
may be difficult for Portugal to be- 
ieve that criticism is due to pure hu- 


April, 1930 


manitarianism,” says the author. This 
is not only difficult for Portugal, it is 
dificult for most thinking people in 

the world. 

It is not solely by the countries that 
Mrs. Simon criticizes that her book is 
to be judged, it is by her strange re- 
ticences. She, for instance, has noth- 
ing to say about forced labor in the 
French Congo or in the Belgian Congo 
or about peonage in the southern 
United States. Is this because France 
and Belgium and America are very 
dear to the British soul just now? 

God knows it is a blot upon modern 
civilization that four or five million 
persons are held as actual slaves today 
in the world; but the imperial aggres- 
sion of white folk led by Great Britain, 
is not only indirect cause of this con- 
tinued slavery, but the cause of the 
virtual enslavement of many millions 
more, who, while they are not saleable 
property, are nevertheless real prop- 
erty of the great white profit-making 
corporations. 


“Born To Be.’ By Taylor Gordon. 

New York, 19290. 

Taylor Gordon’s autobiography is 
another product of the Van Vechten 
school of Negro literature. It was 
written by a white woman, Muriel 
Draper, who translates as near as 
may be Mr. Taylor’s actual words. 
The result is, as Mr. Van Vechten as- 
sures us, “something new,” and “a hu- 
man document of the first order.” The 
book is frank, rambling, full of anec- 
dotes, loosely constructed, and often 
entertaining. But it does not strike 
us as literature. It, of course, deals 
largely with the dregs. This boy be- 
gins his career as page in a house of 
prostitutior: graduates to gambling 
and opium-smoking, and then, after a 
time, emerges and submerges into more 
legitimate industry and less. He 
came into prominence when Rosamond 
Johnson taught him to sing, and no 
one who has heard Johnson and Gor- 
don sing “Stand Still Jordan!” can 
ever forget its spell. 

Yet, from that singing, comes quite 
a different soul than is revealed in 
“Born To Be”, and on the whole, a 
soul that I like much better. 

I may be wrong, but in this book I 
get the impression that Taylor is ‘“cut- 
ting up” for the white folk. I can see 
Carl and Muriel splitting their sides 
with laughter, while he jiggs and “yah- 
vahs!” But of life, of real life, in that 


De 


drab western town, there must have 
been poignant tragedy as well as 
screaming farce. I would like to hear 
a little more of the inner life of that 
dark mother and of the other wander- 
ing children. But here there is scarce 
a serious word. The book is entertain- 
ing, but by its incompleteness, it is not 
life. It is not literature. 

I am distinctly pained when Taylor 
Gordon tries musical criticism and 
slurs the magnificent work of Na- 
thaniel Dett’s epoch-making choir. I 
suppose this was a sop to his literary 
gods. 

Covarrubias has illustrated the 
book; and not being an art critic, my 
judgment on the success of his work is 
worth little. I am frank to say, how- 
ever, that I think I could exist quite 
happily if Covarrubias had never been 
born. 


“The History of the Alpha Phi 
Alpha’. By Charles H. Wesley. 
Washington, 1929. 

Mr. Wesley in this book has added 
an interesting sidelight to the develop- 
ment of Negro college life. The Alpha 
Phi Alpha was the second Negro 
Greek Letter Fraternity to be estab- 
lished in the United States, and the 
first one among undergraduates. It 
is today the largest and most influen- 
tial. The book is naturally a little 
too statistical and filled with names 
and facts to be easy reading, but it is 
most valuable as a book of reference. 


“Long Long Ago’. By R.C. A. Sam- 
uelson. Durban, 1929. 
This book is too largely missionary 
twaddle, but it has some very interest- 
ing facts and information concerning 


the Zulus of South Africa. 


“A Health Inventory of New York 
City”. By Marshall M. Davis and 
Mary C. Jarrett. New York, 1929. 
This report is published by the Wel- 

fare Council of New York City, and 

illustrates better than any sermons the 
attitude of professional social reformers 
toward American Negroes. In the 

first place, ‘“Negro”’ is spelled with a 

small letter. In the second place, 

while by testimony of this report Ne- 
gro health is one of the larger prob- 
lems of the city, not a single Negro 
appears on the research committees of 
this organization. Finally, we are 

told, ““Negroes, therefore, represent 4 

per cent of the city’s population and

Morning 
By ANTONIO JARVIS 


HE chill fog lifts and in the sky 

A thousand hues of rose and pearl 
Float brightly westward as the wind 
Awaking from its quiet sleep 
Sends cloud and fog sun-tipped with flame 
Behind the distant hills— 
A frenzied bird on beauty fed 
Flings to the day, from startling heights, 
An ode wrung from his prisoned soul, 
Till pleased, the warm, resplendent sun 
Smiles on the drowsy world! 


Slum-Row 
By MARY GIBBONS 


IKE a file of drunken men, with hats 
awry, 

Your drab houses string along the street: 

Caved-in roofs teeter on the brim of 
sagging timbers. 

Like a. drunkard’s limp, loose lips; 

Your porches slump and drool; 

Like thick, filmed eyes 

Your bleary windows gape, 

And water trickles from your broken 
eaves. 

Staggering, you lean toward spattered 
sidewalks, 

Staring at the mouldy gutter-wash. 


Slits of green gas flame peer out un 
certainly, 

And sloven laughter splashes oily gusts 
of noise 

Against the silence that each twilight 
makes. 

Puffs of wan smoke thread through the 
heavy air, 

And curl skyward. 

A gaunt weed, nourished in the shadow, 
droops 

To lean her pale face in the gutter. 

The black fingers of a dead tree sil- 
houettes 

Against a sickly moon.

Tho’ fairer than a lovely maid thou art; 
My bosom swells, and as I stand to face

Insatiable yearnings fill my heart.

How like a youth’s ambition thou art 
smiling, 

High, high beyond the reach of mortal 
arm; 

Yet through abysmal ether, art beguiling 

The soul forever upward with thy charm. 


Impetuously, I stretch my arms to reach 
thee, 
My heart within, impatient for the touch.

Oh—burst poor heart, and weep aloud 
for sorrow; 

The touch of heav’n, to angels only giv’n, 

*Tis counted meet to hope for on the 
morrow 

When toil and tears bring broken hearts 
to heaven. 

And youthful Hope, with gentle wings 
all gory, 

Held fast to earth by Poverty’s strong 
chain, 

Is like a poet’s yearning for the glory 

Of heaven’s embrace—foolish, idle, vain. 


Although strong walls have often broken 
fetters 

Of Penury, and soared on the sky, 

Amid bright stars, to pen their names in 
letters, 

Which like their noble spirits, shall not 
die; 


Still, countless are the souls, which like 
a poet, 

Who fancies he

Have dreamed of glory, yet shall never 
know it, 

And so by dreaming only can be blest.

I Hear a Brown Girl Singing 
By HELEN LENHART YOKE 
B ROWN girl, 
With your slender throat 
That sings to me 


Of all the sorrows of your race, 
Hear my song. 


I have seen your sorrow, 

I have known your heartache 
I have felt your desolation, 
I, too, have been an alien 
In my native land. 


And I say to you: 

Sing! 

Even as your song touched me 
And made me kindred to you, 

So shall it touch mankind 

And fear, and hate, and prejudice, 
Shall vanish with your song. 


Brown girl, 
With your slender throat, 
Sing on, and on, and on. 


American Ideals 
By 
MALCOLM CHRISTIAN CONLEY 


HE red man looking upon the hills, 
Plains and skies, 
Rivers and seas, 
Said “Lord, let me hunt.” 


The white man looking thereupon 
Said, “Lord, let me possess.” 


The black man thereupon gazing 

Grew strangely fond 

Of something vaguely beyond. 

He, with an open chest, 

Gave his heart a throbbing fling 

Unto the glimmering mountain crest. 

The stars his supplication hastened to 
ring 

When he shouted aloud, “Lord, let me 


sing.” 


Passage 
By EFFIE LEE NEWSOME 
MY grandmother has a strange little 
door 

That opens upon the lawn 

With panels across— 

I’ve counted them, four— 

And it’s just as gray as the dawn. 

When Patience and I are there in the 
spring 

We pass through this way to go violet- 
ting. 5 

When Patience and I are out there in 
fall 

We rush through this door 

To hear the crows call. 

In bright summer time beneath the blue 
skies 

We often steal through to find butter- 
flies. 

It has an old knocker we just love to try- 

We hammer it hard each time we go by.

EUROPE 


@ Ina debate on the Colonies in the 
British Parliament an under secretary 
said that the House of Commons was 
responsible for 36 British Colonies and 
Protectorates with 60,000 civil serv- 
ants and 70,000,000 natives. Out of 
15,000,000 children of school age only 
2,500,000 were enrolled in schools. 


@ The Hampton Institute choir un- 
der the direction of R. Nathaniel Dett 
will tour Europe during the month of 
May. 

@ Pietro Mascagni, the great Italian 
composer, is collecting American Ne- 
gro music, in order, as he says, to re- 
educate Europeans. ‘““The Negro songs 
which I heard twenty-seven years ago 
in the United States are real music, 
and we Europeans have almost lost the 
sense of true music.” 


@ Paul Robeson has been singing to 
a great audience in Albert Hall, Lon- 
don. He was accompanied by Law- 
rence Brown and is starting a concert 
tour in Great Britain. After that he 
will begin rehearsals for Othello. 


@ Mrs. Emilie Hapgood is dead in 
Italy, She will be remembered as the 
hrst promoter of Negro plays on 
Broadway. It was her interest and 
money that launched the Colored Play- 
ers in 1917-18. Three plays written 
by Ridgeley Torrence were staged, 
The Rider of Dreams”, “Granny 
Maumee”, and “Simon the Cyrenian.” 
Among the players were Opal Cooper, 
Inez Clough, and many others who 
have since made their mark. The 
striking costumes were designed by 
Robert Edmond Jones. 


April, 1930 


AMERICA 

@ The Sixteenth Annual Observance 
of Negro Health Week took place 
March 30th to April 6th under the 
auspices of the Tuskegee Conference, 
the National Business League, and the 
U. S. Public Health Service. The 
Health Service furnished free of 
charge programs and posters. 
@ Michael Gold says in the Febru- 
ary New Masses that “the Communist 
Party has done more work among Ne- 
groes than the Socialist Party has ever 
done in twenty-five years of activity.” 

Even today the Socialist Party has a 
segregationist attitude toward the Negro. 
It will deny this, but we need only study 
its recent organization work in the 
South. 

The Socialists carefully and opportu- 


nistioally avoided all mention of the Ne- 
gro problem in their textile unionizing. 
But the Communists faced the problem 
squarely and boldly—almost  suicidally, 
some fainthearts believed. The Commu- 
nists insisted that the Negroes be or- 
ganized equally with the white workers. 
Events justified them. The white 
Southern textile workers, in a few 
months, learned the lesson of solidarity. 
They responded nobly when they under- 
stood. They came to realize for them- 
selves that the. segregation of Negro 
and white workers is one of the methods 
by which the textile tyranny oppresses 
the South.

several other important committees, 
His constituency, the Third Ward, has 
more white than colored voters. 

@ Alcide Delmont was Under-Secre- 
tary for the Colonies in the administra- 
tion of André Tardieu in France. M. 
Delmont was born in Martinique, 
French West Indies, in 1874. He was 
educated at the local lyceum and given 
a scholarship to study law in Paris. 
He was admitted to the bar in 1895 
and received his doctorate three years 
later. He began to practice law and 
also took active part in matters of so- 
cial reform, especially during the labor 
strike of 1898. He then returned to 
Martinique where he stayed five years 
defending the fishing industry in the 
courts. He also helped in the secu- 
larization of the schools and the hos- 
pitals. Delmont returned to Paris 
in 1904. He won the Paillet prize for 
an essay on the Reform of the Colonial 
Constitutions. This is a prize offered 
by the Conference of Paris Lawyers 
and has been won by many distin- 
guished advocates. He delivered many 
lectures under the patronage of the 
Ligue des Droits de l’Hommes and 
was elected one of the forty members

support during the last election. 


@ Edward Matthews, a colored bari- 
tone singer of Boston, is forging to 
the front. He is a product of Fisk 
University and has had the friend- 
ship and help of Roland Hayes. In 
February he gave a recital in Jordan 
Hall, Boston. 

@ Otto Bohanan has been appointed 
teacher of music in the Dewit Clin- 
ton High School of New York. He 
won in a competition over forty other 
candidates. 

@ Negro Clergymen of New York 
withdrew their support from the Fed- 
eration of Churches in February be- 
cause of a report of the research di- 
rector who blamed Negroes for mov- 
ing into white neighborhoods and put- 
ting the white churches “out of busi- 
ness.” This seemed like a plea for 
segregation; the Federation declared 
“We never have stood and do not now 
stand for the segregation of the col- 
ored people in this city.” The colored 
ministers have rejoined the Federa- 
tion. 

@ J. K. Humphrey, a colored minis- 
ter, reports that he has been unfrocked 
by the Seventh Day Adventist Con- 
ference of Greater New York because 
he tried to purchase property for his 
colored church in Atlantic Highlands. 
He charges that the Conference has 
forty-three sanitariums and_ hospitals 
costing nearly six million dollars to 
which Negroes, usually, are not ad- 
mitted. 

@ Miss Marion Anderson, the well- 
known contralto singer, has appeared 
in concert at Carnegie Hall, New 
York City. 

@ Radio Station WEDH in Erie, 
Pennsylvania, is a station of the Erie 
Dispatch-Herald. The programs of 
this station are broadcast from Can- 
ada to the Gulf of Mexico and reach 
thirty-nine states of the Union. The 
chief engineer of the station is a col- 
ored man, Wendell King. He is a 
member of the Institute of Radio 
Engineers and the American Institute 
of Electrical Engineers. Mr. King is 
a graduate of Union College of Sche- 
nectady where he majored in elec- 
trical engineering, studying under the 
well-known Steinmetz. For a time he 
worked in the research laboratory of 
the General Electric Company and 
then became a sergeant in the army 
during the war. After the war he 
was employed by an electrical manu- 
facturing company in Cleveland and 
then took charge of a radio station at 
Ashtabula. Under his personal super- 
vision this station was moved to Erie 
in December, 1927. Mr. King is 
twenty-nine years of age, and unmar- 
ried. His station is atop of the Com- 
merce office building, a eleven-story 
skyscraper.

@ The Builders Conference held its 
eighth annual meeting at Hampton in 
February. It is a meeting of colored 
contractors and builders. 


@ A Wisconsin boy wrote these 
words in his diary during the Civil 
War in 1864 from Chattanooga, 
Tenn.: ‘We have a Negro regiment 
here called the Fourteenth U. S. In- 
fantry under Colonel Morgan. I 
went to see them on dress parade and 
never saw a regiment go through the 
various maneuvers of said parade bet- 
ter, in fact but few equalled them. 
They were organized November 29, 
1863. ... The Government pays 
them $7.50 a month. General Stead- 
man, Commander of this post, said to 
Colonel Morgan, ‘If I were a Colonel, 
I’d rather have command of this regi- 
ment than any regiment of whites I’ve 
ever seen.’ ” 


@ Dr. George P. Phenix has been 
elected fourth principal of Hampton 
Institute, succeeding General Arm- 
strong, Dr. Frissell and Dr. Gregg, 
who resigned last Fall. Dr. Phenix 
was born in Maine in 1864. He is a 
graduate of Colby and for a long time 
was principal of the State Normal 
School at Willimantic, Conn. He 
came to Hampton in 1904 and took 
charge of the academic work. Later 
he was made vice-principal, and after 
the death of Dr. Frissell was made 
acting Principal. When Dr. Gregg 
resigned last July, Dr. Phenix was 
again made acting principal and in 
January was elected principal and 
member of the Board of Trustees.

@ Mrs.. Georgia Ellis, a colored law- 
ver, has been nominated for the Leg- 
islature of Illinois by the Republicans 
of the Hyde Park District of Chicago. 
@ At an exhibition at the Palette 
Club, Richmond, Indiana, a white 
girl, Maude Kaufman Eggemeyer ex- 
hibited a painting of “A Brown Girl 
with Beads.” Mary Ellen Spears was 
the model who posed for the picture. 
@ At Benzonia, Michigan, there is 
said to be a chance for colored peo- 
ple to buy good farm and fruit land. 


A forty acre farm with a house, tim- 
ber, and orchard can be had for $800. 


@ Henry M. Porter, a colored man, 
has been made one of the supervisors 
of Census work in the colored district 
of Chicago. Porter was born in-Texas

and is a graduate of the University 
of Michigan. 

@ The New Provident Hospital in 
Chicago has succeeded in raising three 
million two hundred twelve thousand 
dollars for its new plant. Julius 
Rosenwald cabled $220,000 from 
Europe, and Mrs. Helen Swift Neil- 
son cabled $50,000. | 

@ Mrs. Annie M. Malone of St. 
Louis has given $15,000 to the New 
Provident Hospital, Chicago. 

@ Dr. Allen J. Westley, a graduate 
of Fisk University and treasurer of 
the Sigma Pi Phi fraternity, died in 
Chicago in December. He was prom- 
inent as a physician and in fraternity 
circles. 

@ Frank Young, colored doorman at 
the Miller Theatre, captured single- 
handed two hold-up men at Wichita, 
Kansas. A fund to reward him has 
been raised by the city. Crowds have 
been flocking to see him and messages 
of congratulation have poured in, 

@ The Gilpin Players have given 
“Roseanne,” a play in three acts, in 
Cleveland. The Plaindealer, a prom- 
inent Cleveland daily, under whose 
auspices the play was given, says that 
the play thrilled the crowd at Public 
Hall. 

A number of ministers, however, 
protested at the way in which the 
church was treated by the play. The 
difficulty of free expression in Negro 
art is thus indicated. 


MIDDLE SOUTH 


@ New Orleans has a population of 
120,000 colored people and only one 
playground for colored children. 
Three or four playgrounds in the midst 
of the colored district are posted with 
the sign “No Colored Wanted.” 


@ The Montgomery Advertiser, a 
leading white daily of Alabama, had 
recently two editorials on Dr. George 
W. Carver of Tuskegee that said 
among other things: 

“It seemed to the Advertiser that at 
this time when the Alabama farmer is 
none too cheerful and none too certain 
what to do, the great story of Carver 
of Tuskegee should be told in more de- 
tail than it has been told before.” It 
added, “Alabama can boast that it has 
a man who has probably done more in 
this field of research and probably knows 
more about the chemical possibilities of 
plants than any other scientist in the 
world. That man is George W. Car- 
ver, the great Negro scientist of Tus- 
kegee Institute.” 

@ In the face of this comes the fol- 
lowing report from Oklahoma _pub- 
lished in the Black Despatch: 

“Dr. George W. Carver, noted scien- 
tist of Tuskeegee met the mailed fist 
of prejudice when his recretary applied 
for drawing-room accommodations to 


Dallas, Texas, over the Santa Fee and 
was refused by Glenn Eddie, division 
passenger agent. As a result of the re. 
fusal, Dr. Carver and his secretary were 
forced to ride to Dallas in a separate 
coach over the Santa Fee to keep his 
lecture engagements.” 


@ The Union Electrical Magazine, 
published in St. Louis, carries a pic. 
ture of Oscar Fichlin. Mr. Fichlin 
has worked with the Union Electric 
Light and Power Company for 
twenty-four years. He began as por- 
ter, then became clerk, then labora- 
tory assistant, and is now chemist at 
the Ashley Street laboratory.

@ At McAlester, Oklahoma, sixty- 
one miners lost their lives in an ex- 
plosion, sixteen of them being colored. 
A relief fund of $80,000 was raised 
in the state and the Red Cross as- 
sisted by an appropriation of $5,000 
and by taking charge of the relief 
work. 

@ Robert D. Harrison has been a 
railway mail clerk for thirty-eight 
years and ten months in the Post Of- 
fice of Fort Smith, Arkansas. He 
was retired last June after a total of 
forty-four years of service, and on his 
sixty-second birthday. He received a 
letter of congratulation signed by the 
Postmaster General and other tokens 
of appreciation. With his salary he 
has educated as physicians a brother 
and a son, and he owns considerable 
real estate. 


@ There are 106 trainmen working 
on 1100 miles of the lines of the Mis- 
souri-Pacific. They have a union and 
a charter from the American Federa- 
tion of Labor. Nevertheless they are 
not recognized by the white union nor 
are they admitted to the white union. 
By arrangement between the white 
union and the railroad, no further 
Negro trainmen are to be hired so that 
when one of the present number dies 
or is discharged, no other colored man 
takes his place.

A STUDENT'S CREED 
By Gladys M. Whitfield 


BELIEVE in myself. There is 

something peculiar to me that is 
valuable, to me, and to mankind. To 
be a worthwhile student, | must dis- 
<over and use my intrinsic inclinations 
and abilities. 

In order to develop my good traits 
I must work. I must work hard and 
do far more than is required of me. 

I believe in my fellowman. Every- 
one has something to contribute to 
common good, just as I have something 
to contribute. I believe in all peoples, 
everywhere, regardless of race or 
creed. They too have peculiar values 
that will aid human progress. 

Because I believe in my fellowman, 
I appreciate his offering to humanity, 
his condition, elevating or degrading; 
his ideals, high or low. He was cre- 
ated for some purpose. Perhaps he 
failed to find it. 

I believe in noble character. I can 
not be great by having greatness as an 
ideal, nor can I achieve fame by crush- 
ing others and using them as a means 
to my desired goal. True worth 
comes as the result of losing one’s self 
in a great humanistic movement. 

I believe in religion—any kind of re- 
ligion, Christian, Jewish, Mohammed- 
an, or any of the others that help man 
to live nobly, reverence a supreme 
power, and give himself most com- 
pletely to ethical human growth and 
happiness. 


VERYONE knows that February 

ushered in the birthdays of two 
of our most noted men in history, 
namely, Abraham Lincoln and Fred- 
erick Douglass. These men should 
mean more to us as a race than to any 
other people, because they were both 
instrumental in securing for us this lib- 
erty which we now enjoy. Each man 
put forth his greatest effort to snuff out 
the life of that hideous monster 
“slavery”. 


136 


Douglas, born a slave came face to 
face with it and spent his life trying 
to bring about its extinction. He 
traveled extensively, gave many spirit- 
ed orations, led an “Anti-Slavery” 
campaign, published books and edited 
newspapers. These were all in the de- 
fence of his people. ‘Today he stands 
as the first man of our Negro race. 
Why shouldn’t we honor him? 

Every branch of the N. A. A. C. P. 
in this country should have held some 
sort of public celebration in honor of 
these two men. February fifth, Long 
Branch group gave its celebration. The 
program, presented by the Juniors con- 
sisted of: a biography of Frederick 
Douglass, Lincoln’s famous Gettysburg 
Address and orations by both celebri- 
ties dealing with the fallacies of 
slavery. Many people went away 
with a clearer conception of what these 
two men contributed toward our large 
step to freedom.

SCHOOL RECORDS 


T Lincoln, Nebraska, in January, 

Theodore Howard, a_ colored 
student at Union College was de- 
clared winner in the college oratorical 
contest. He had six white competi- 
tors. He will represent Nebraska in 
an inter-state contest to be held in De- 
troit. His subject was “The Prohibi- 
tion Amendment as it Effects the 
Negro Race.” 

During forty years of sports competi- 
tion, eight Negro students of the Uni- 
versity of Iowa have been letter men. 
There were five in football: Holbrook, 
Alexander, Slater, Galloway and Ben- 
jamin; there was a broad-jumper, Gor- 





don; a sprinter, Roberts; and a base- 
ball player, Crawford. 


Here is a story of the reputation 
which one colored boy made at school. 
We take it from a daily paper: 

If anyone, teachers or students, needs 
help of any sort at the Johns Hill junior 
high school, there is one lad who js 
always ready to give it to them. What- 
ever the difficulty whether it be an ac- 
cident on the playgrounds, a load of 
books too heavy for some one to carry, 
or monitor work to be done Searcy 
Garrison, colored, son of Mr. and Mrs. 
John Garrison, is on the spot to con- 
tribute whatever he can in the way of 
assistance. 

Searcy, aged fifteen, thinks now that 
he will be an undertaker when he grows 
up and his associates say that he has 
the soothing manner and_ unassuming 
nature that are excellent qualifications 
for the profession. 

Wishing to let his parents know how 
much the school is impressed with the 
lad’s fine attitude, his teacher, Miss 
Sadie Fitzpatrick, wrote the following 
letter to his parents: 

Dear Mrs. Garrison: Before Searcy 
leaves my room I wish to tell you how 
thoroughly I have enjoyed having him 
in my room. Everyone of his teachers 
has remarked to me about him especially 
concerning his wonderful attitude. The 
coach says he is just the same on the 
field, so dependable. Searcy is so kind 
and considerate of others, always polite 
and willing to help in anything that is to 
be done. We also admire his quiet, 
gentle way of going about his work and 
doing his best to get it done. 

You surely have a son to be proud of. 
May he have success and be a source of 
pride and joy to you always. 


The Storm 


HE air grows very sultry, 
Without its usual breeze— 
The long-expected downpour comes, 
The wind tears through the trees, 
A clap of thunder shakes the earth 
With a rumbling, muttering sound, 
A streak of lightning flits above, 
Revealing the homeward bound. 
With a rending crash a limb falls down, 
Its leaves are blown about the ground, 
The hissing rain in torrents beats 
Upon the homes of many streets 
While inmates are indeed alarmed 
Until the mighty storm is calmed; 
And then, at last, to end their strife 
A sunbeam sheds reviving life.

PROGRAMS OF EMANCIP4A- 


TION 


T js natural that with so old an or- 

ganization as the National _Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People there should arise ever 
and again criticisms of its program 
and accomplishments by  radically- 
minded folk. The interesting result, 
however, of most of these criticisms 
is that when it comes to practical pro- 
grams they are all in essential agree- 
ment with ours. 

Take, for instance, the recently an- 
nounced program of the American 
Negro Labor Congress, a Communis- 
tic organization. We put their pro- 
gram and ours in parallel columns:

or the organization

white farmers and 
agricultural workers. 


There is naturally difference of em- 
hasis, The Labor Congress lays its 
chief emphasis on the organization of 
Labor and criticizes the N. A. A. 

- P. as the potential leader of a class 


April, 1930 


of small capitalists in opposition to the 
interests of the laborers. 

The N. A. A. C. P., on the other 
hand, points to its tremendous record 
of accomplishment. ‘There are very 
few organizations in the United States 
that have been able in less than a gen- 
eration to show so many concrete evi- 
dences of successful work of agitation. 
On the other hand, the criticism of 
the Labor Congress is not a criticism 
of what has happened, but of what 
might be expected to happen according 
to the formula of Marxian socialism. 

The N. A. A. C. P. is by no means 
unaware of this. Many of us for a 
series of years have warned against 
an attempt to solve the American 
Negro problem simply by the capitalis- 
tic program of accumulating wealth. 
So far, there is not the slightest ground 
for accusing the N. A. A. C. P. of 
taking the part of the landlord and 
the employer against the laborer. The 
facts are absolutely to the contrary. 

At the same time, the position of 
this organization in its attitude toward 
wealth and capital is and must be dif- 
ficult. We live in the greatest cap- 
italistic country of the age and prob- 
ably of all ages. We must look that 
fact square in the face and endeavor, 
in the first place, to align ourselves 
with those who seek to correct the evils 
of capitalistic organization, and, at 
the same time, preserve its tremendous 
possibilities for good. This is a hard 
road. In countries, like Russia, it has 
led to war and revolution; and our 
chief difference with the American 
Negro Labor Congress is that we do 
not believe that similar reform in the 
United States need entail violence. It 
will call for sacrifice, patience, clear 
thinking, determined agitation, and 
intelligent voting. But if civilization 
is not a failure, it will call for noth- 
ing more than this. And on this plat- 
form the N. A. A. C. P. puts its feet. 


HAITI 


HE action of President Hoover 

in regard to Haiti has been dis- 
appointing. The personnel of his 
Commission is not re-assuring. Forbes 
believes in imperial aggression although 
he would insist that it be efficient. 
Fletcher came near plunging the 


United States and Mexico into war. 
The Catholic Church secured repre- 
sentatives but the Negro race did not. 
Liberalism across the color line has 
but one lone advocate, Will Allen 
White. From such a Commission we 
must await a coat of fairly thick white- 
wash for Russell and his marines; a 
disparaging criticism of the Haitians 
and advice to withdraw some time, 
perhaps in 1936, under cover of a 
Platt proviso and the financial tyranny 
of the National City Bank. 
Meanwhile, we deeply regret Dr. 
Moton’s consent to make a separate 
survey in Education. He should have 
been made a full member of the Com- 
mission, both because of the importance 
of education in Haiti, and the miser- 
able failure of America to encourage 
it, and also because of his Negro de- 
scent. A firm refusal of Dr. Moton 
to accept a subordinative appointment, 
and a calm insistence that Mr. Hoover 
attend his own racial chestnuts would 
have immensely pleased THe Crisis. 


THE FORWARD-LOOKING 
SOUTH 
HE Commission on Inter-racial 
Co-operation, Atlanta, Georgia, 
has published a leaflet on our ‘“Chris- 
tian obligation to the Negro” by the 
Reverend A. M. Pierce, Editor of the 
Wesleyan Christian Advocate. It is 
safe to say that a leaflet like this pub- 
lished in Atlanta fifteen years ago 
would have compelled Mr. Pierce to 
leave the city. The pamphlet demands 
for the education of the Negro: 

“An equal share with ourselves. 
His buildings must be as good as ours, 
his teachers as well qualified, his op- 
portunities as extended, running even 
to the university. . . .” 

On railroads, 

“So long as the Negro pays as much 
for service as the white man there 
must be no differences in the accom- 
modations that he receives. . . .” 

“The full rights of citizenship are 
his. He must be allowed to exercise 
the franchise on the identical terms 
that determine the vote of the white 
MAH sac 

“Courtesy is demanded. ... He 
must be addressed in terms of respect.” 

“Tf the attention of the white race 
is centered upon an absolutely fair deal

toward the colored race in business, 
professional life, industry, domestic 
relations, education, courtesy, religion, 
civic affairs; if the two races meet each 
other on terms of mutual self-respect 
in all other relations, the question of 
social relations will take care of it-

This is what we call Christianity 
and a New South. 


THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 


E have received from a Catho- 

lic priest in Missouri a_per- 
sonal request for further information, 
or substantiation of an article in THE 
Crisis: “The Color Line and the 
Church,” November, 1929, in so far 
as it concerns the Roman Catholic 
Church. We are glad to answer: 

1. So far as the official attitude of 
the Catholic Church is concerned, 
there has never been a drawing of ra- 
cial and color lines. There have been 
black Catholics and black priests, black 
bishops and black saints. 

2. In the Catholic Church of Amer- 
ica there has been in practice an enor- 
mous. amount of discrimination and 
segregation against Negroes. In the 
first place, it is manifest that there has 
been no whole-hearted attempt to pro- 
vide a Negro clergy for Negro Catho- 
lics in America. This discrimination 
has been brought about: 

A. By the assumption of many 
Catholics that Negroes were not fit 
for the priesthood. 

B. By the refusal to admit Negroes 
to most of the Catholic colleges and 
seminaries. 

C. By the frequent assertion that 
Negroes did not want Negro priests. 

3. There has been discrimination in 
individual Catholic churches and in 
nearly all parochial schools. In many 
Catholic churches Negroes have been 
given distinctly to understand that 
they were not wanted, and that they 
should go, even at considerable physi- 
cal inconvenience, to special colored 
Catholic congregations. In the ma- 
jority of parochial schools, even in the 
North, colored children are not ad- 
mitted, except to separate colored 
schools. 

4. Even with this wide-spread prac- 
tice of race segregation in church ac- 
tivities, there has been very little at- 
tempt, on the part of the American 
Catholic Church, to establish efficient 
and complete separate institutions. 
There is not a first-class Negro Catho- 
lic college, seminary nor high school 
in the United States. In the history 
of the Catholic Church in the United 
States covering as it does over three 
centuries, there have been just seven 
priests of acknowledged Negro blood 
ordained. No other American church 


138 


has so plain a record of systematic 
neglect. 

For these reasons, THE Crisis has 
long insisted and continues to insist 
that the hierarchy of the American 
Catholic Church does not desire black 


communicants. 


FARMING 


HE Arkansas Democrat, a white 

daily paper of the South, endorses 
a back-to-the-farm movement for Ne- 
groes, and has secured the co-operation 
of a number of Negro teachers and 
preachers, including Bishop Green of 
the A. M. E. Church, and Bishop 
Demby of the Episcopal Church. This 
movement emphasizes the fact that 
farm life is more normal for Negroes; 
that city life leads to crime; and that 
there is a chance for economic salva- 
tion on the farms of the South. 

There is every once-in-a-while a re- 
crudescence of this old idea. It was 
back of the agricultural education 
given in Negro industrial schools for 
years and still continuing in many. 
The result, however, of all this advice 
and propaganda has been to decrease 
the Negro farm population and, we 
may safely say, that not one in ten of 
the Negro school trained farmers have 
gone into farming or stayed there. 

Why is this? It is not because the 
work of the farmer is not, as these 
promoters say, a healthful and impor- 
tant employment. The reason, how- 
ever, that the Negro farmer is not suc- 
ceeding and is not increasing is per- 
fectly clear. 

1. The lawlessness of the country 
districts of the South. Is it possible 
that the promoters of this movement 
have forgotten what happened to 79 
Negro peons who tried to get decent 
returns for their toil in Arkansas a 
few years ago? 

2. The lack of education and cul- 
tural surroundings in country districts, 
and the systematic cheating and ex- 
ploitation of the Negroes. 

3. The fact that under the present 
industrial organization, with the gov- 
ernment aid that is given to manu- 
facturers, and with the higher intelli- 
gence of the industrial group, the farm 
group in the United States, both white 
and black, is so deprived of a decent 
return for their work, that they simply 
can not make ends meet. The whole 
farm situation in the United States 
is an illustration of this failure of a 
great industry. 

Everybody knows these facts. Why, 
then, should people of ordinary intel- 
ligence, standing up and facing this 
situation, ask the Negro to return to 
the farm? Nobody but a blithering 
idiot would follow their advice. If 
the South wants to re-establish the 


Negro upon the land, it is very easy to 
do it. The South should assure the 
black farmer law and order and a de. 
cent education in country districts, ]; 
should give the black farmer the right 
to vote, so that he can have control of 
local officials and local taxation, |t 
should ask the nation to reduce the 
tariff on manufactured articles, so as 
to take from the manufacturer the 
bonus which enables him to oppress 
and rob the farmer. It should encour- 
age black farmers, as it has begun to 
encourage white farmers, to adopt co- 
operative marketing and the selling of 
farm produce direct to the consumers 
at paying prices. If the South does 
this, they will not need to help the 
Negro to go to the farm. He will go 
without urging and so will the white 
man. But until the South does this, 
everybody knows that movements like 
that backed by the Arkansas Democrat, 
are insincere and silly.

which we can not vouch. We print no

ily into a window, in which were vis- 
ible nothing but dark reflections. A 
sense of loneliness came over me, and a 
feeling of resentment, as I thought of 
the young colored school teacher back 
in the “Jim-Crow” car, surrounded, 
no doubt, by people no more interest- 
ing to him than were these people to 
me. 

And yet he had left me with a smile! 
Then it was that I recalled some lines 
written by Paul Laurence Dunbar— 
and I understood why he smiled: 

“Why should the world be over- 

wise 

In counting all our tears and sighs? 

Nay, let them only see us while 

We wear the mask.” 

But I had seen him without the 

mask—and knew him for my brother.

the County Hospital, and at the same 
time came another supervisoral elec- 
tion of the same men who had prom- 
ised four years before that there should 
be Negro representation in the train- 
ing school. 

It was in May, 1928, that I dis- 


covered to my horror that the Board 


139 





of Supervisors of Alameda County 
were figuring to allow in the fall budg- 
et $200,000 to build a dormitory to 
this already expensive plant, to house 
Negro students. Can you imagine 
where my heart went when I learned 
that Negro citizens were willingly 
sanctioning this policy! More than 
ever, I discouraged the idea of the stu- 
dents registering for training to be 
segregated. 

Some few of the women of the 
League of Women Voters, including 
the president, felt it was expedient to 
have students register and enter, re- 
gardless of being segregated. I con- 
tended, “‘no segregation” in Alameda 
County; for so doing, my life in the 
League of Women Voters was made 
quite miserable for me and finally I 
wa asked to resign. 

It was this year, 1928, that the Hos- 
pital Committee of the Alameda Coun- 
ty League of Colored Women Voters 
scraped up two beautiful young Negro 
women and entered them in the train- 
ing school of Alameda County know- 
ingly (according to the report of the 
secretary of the Hospital Committee) 
to be segregated in the basement of the 
Annex Building on a concrete floor 
with furniture consisting of two steam- 
er deck chairs without cushions, two 
hard straight back chairs and a table 
resembling one that might have come 
from a rummage heap. This room is 
between the Hospital laundry and the 
boiler room, with steam and sewer 
pipes overhead and no heat. The Ne- 
gro students must, under such condi- 
tions as these, spend their rest periods. 
They are allowed forty-five dollars a 
month to room and board at home. 

Kind sir, may the world know that 
what I failed to do was to sanction 
segregation in an institution in a coun- 
ty where the laws of the state give 
equal rights to every tax payer, just 
for the sake of saying, “We got colored 
nurses in training.”

SOUTH AFRICA 


@ The Beaumont Commission of 
South Africa gave 75 per cent of the 
land in the Union to barely a million 
Europeans, and the remaining 25 per 
cent to over five million natives. The 
result is that the native reservations 
are so congested that the natives are 
forced to go to town seeking work. 
Despite this, a recent congress of the 
Chambers of Commerce held at Cape- 
town voted that natives should be seg- 
regated in the cities and gradually re- 
turned to the country. 

@ Clements Kadalie has been ar- 
rested in East London, South Africa, 
for his attempt to lead a strike of the 
native railway workers. The magis- 
trate warned the natives that picketing 
was unlawful. He was constantly in- 
terrupted. Kadalie was arrested with 
eight members of the committee and 
bail was refused.

recently visited New York and had 
dinner and conference with frank dis- 
cussion with a number of the Negro 
leaders. 

@ A Capetown conference was called 
by Professor D. D. T. Jabavu and Dr. 


A. Abdurahman. There were present 
natives, colored people, and Indians, 
and there was bitter protest against 
the methods of European rule. There 
was especial debate on the Dutch Re- 
formed Church and a resolution to 
boycott it. The conference continued 
three days. Professor Abdurahman 
showed that out of an expenditure of 
$36,250,000 for education, only $4,- 
250,000 was spent for non-Europeans. 
The following resolution against the 
Dutch Reformed Church was passed: 


“Seeing that the Dutch Reformed 
Church in South Africa is instigating 
and abetting and conniving at the per- 
secution of the non-European, this con- 
ference now calls for an emphatic ‘dec- 
laration of war’ against this church—it 
declares every predikant and missionary 
to be the mortal enemy of our people; 
calls upon every non-European to leave 
this unchristian church within a period 
of three months; instructs every non- 
European to boycott and ostracise any 
of their people who still remain in this 
Church after the aforesaid period; and

Round Table Talks—Twentieth Year Program 


In November, 1910, the CRISIS began. 


With these issues 


we start the 20th year which we hope to finish with a 
larger circulation and a bigger and better magazine. This 
will be possible only through the co-operation of writers, 
advertisers, agents, subscribers and buyers of single copies. 


LLOW me to thank you for print- 

ing the facts about Rabindranath 
Tagore’s treatment on the Pacific 
Coast. I had an intimation of this 
from something I saw, but it was very 
unsatisfactory and incomplete. The 
facts, I think, ought to be more general- 
ly known. If they had treated a coal 
heaver this way no harm would have 
been done, for a coal heaver is accus- 
tomed to that kind of treatment; but 
to treat as wonderful a soul as Tagore 
was treated in San Francisco shows a 
lack of manners, for which our entire 
government should be ashamed . 

Dr. Tagore’s message is a wonderful 
one and I hope that you will find oc- 
casion to insert it, as well as that of 
Mahatma Gandhi, in frequent num- 
bers of THE Crisis. 

Bolton Smith, Memphis, Tenn. 


I have not the time to write you as 
I would write on several matters which 
my now belated reading of the July 
Crisis impress upon me; but I now 
express to you my thought that your 
“Government by Graft” is one of the 
most effective brief statements of the 
case which I have read. 

I always find your opening summary 
unique in its power as well as grasp of 
situations. It makes me mourn again 
and again, as I said to you in my house 
here ten years ago, that you did not 
use qualities so notable for constructive 
pulling together rather than for the dis- 
integrating criticisms you write over 
and again of Hampton and Tuskegee. 


The recent incident of Mr. Abbott’s 
London hotel experiences makes it clear 
that the richness of the artistic endow- 
ments of the African can not be driven 
into the minds or hearts of the absurd- 
ly egotistic Nordics, but must be car- 
ried into the consciousness of minds 
opened by the practice of the extraordi- 
nary qualities of Patience and Gentle- 
ness which the greatest of the Prophets 
has shown to be more powerful than 
any Marxian types of antagonists. 

The Verse page is fine, I think. And 
in fact, the whole July number has 
too much richness of material to allow 
one to be merely passive in regretful 
thought that so many minds are kept 
from even reading one of the most bril- 
liant of current periodicals. 


George Foster Peabody, Saratoga. 


Permit me to congratulate you upon 
the distinctive improvement in THE 
Crisis. It is the one magazine for 
which I “‘crave” each month, and im- 
mediately upon its receipt, I read it in 
its entirety. 


G. D. Brantley, Missouri. 


I want to compliment the mechanics, 
art work, etc., in reproducing Mrs. De 
Priest’s picture in a recent issue of THE 
Crisis. It was particularly fine—that 
was the general comment. 


Morris Lewis, Secretary 
to Congressman DePriest.

Each month I look forward to and 
read THe Crisis with a great deal of 
pleasure. But being a mere woman 
there is an article in the November is- 
sue that appeals to me particularly. 

I refer to “I am not Invited”. I 
think every woman should read and 
profit by it and so I am going to repro- 
duce it—of course, giving credit to 
Tue Crists—on the Woman’s Page 
of the —————————. It is a whole 
sermon to women in a brief article. 


Allow me to thank you for “The 
Stroud Family” in July, and for “Clif- 
ford Blount” in August. This is the 
kind of stuff that I have longed to see 
in THE Crisis. Cannot tell you how 
these articles pepped me up, and there 
are many others who were helped 
thereby, I am sure. 

Sam B. Wallace, South Carolina. 


Just a line to express my apprecia- 
tion, as a reader of your valuable maga- 
zines, of the very great service THE 
Crisis is doing for our people along 
all lines. Just now I am attracted by 
your comprehensive reply to the young 
man who has chosen Journalism as a 
profession. 

Sam Williams, Massachusetts.

above and send the magazine to me at

joys reading your magazine.
