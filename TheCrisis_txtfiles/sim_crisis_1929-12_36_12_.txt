HE tears shed in the Fall trial “ We 
have plunged us all into gloom. As the Crow Flies 
It is certainly a shame the way they ie we 


pick on these rich thieves.—Persons 
who want proof of Southern chivalry 
toward women, should note that the 
murderers of Ella May Wiggins at 
Gastonia, North Carolina, are still 
free. But she was only a mill worker 
and mother of five children.—Also, 
the world is safe for democracy and 
seven communists will spend their 
lives in North Carolina prisons 
whether they are guilty or not—Mrs. 
Grundy’s husband collected $600,000 
to elect Coolidge and a million dollars 
to elect Hoover. He now proposes 
that the Congress of the United States 
shall come across with the tariff graft 
that he demands.—We’re paying the 
piper ; we've gamboled and gambled all 
winter and all summer, and now comes 
the time to pay up. Wall Street is 
“optimistic”. Sure. Why not? Wall 
Street hasn’t lost anything.—Every- 
body knows that amateur sport inside 
and outside of colleges is so subsidized 
as to make it one of the most profitable 
of careers. Ask Helen Wills. But it 
is no less than scandalous to have the 
Carnegie Foundation say so in plain

English, with figures.—Senator Bing- 
ham is rightly puzzled. If you want 
to hear your master’s voice, the best 
way is to listen to it directly, even if 
you have to hire it as Private Secre- 
tary. Why, then, all this hullabaloo 
over Eyanson ?—After the tumult and 
the shouting about peace and fewer 
warships, somebody might spend a 
profitable afternoon in finding out who 
it is that pays for the war propaganda 
seen in every single movie house in the 
United States every day: guns, 
marines, West Point cadets, defense, 
patriotism, spies, and preparedness !— 
Nadir Kahn, the new King of Afghan- 
istan, will now start toward Zenith, 
to the discomfiture of white Europe 
which has been full of expectations and 
oil—The American Federation of La- 
bor has been meeting in Toronto and 
whistling to keep its courage up. The 
problem is how labor can be swallowed 
by capital and yet escape Nirvana.— 
Another lone flier has found in mid- 
Atlantic that secret path to the Un- 
discovered Country—The President

January and the Year 1930! W 
have large plans for January: a 
beautiful story, “White Lilacs’, il- 
lustrated by Laura Wheeler; the 
conclusion of Matney’s “Exploita- 
tion or Cooperation” and an inter- 
esting editorial on Miscegenation; 
O yes! and pictures of the black 
rulers of white America—mem- 
bers of Congress, legislatures and 
boards of aldermen. And the rest 
of 1930? Wait! 


commana 


of the United States, having kicked 
out and anathematized all the black 
grafters in the Southern Republican 
Party, is now finding to his apparent 
surprise, that all he has left is white 
grafters. What do you suppose he ex- 
pected ?—At last it has come to a 
showdown: all this talk about wo- 
men’s rights, sex equality and brains, 
etc., is put to vital test this winter in 
skirt-lengths; we watch with interest 
to see the number of women strong 
enough still to have legs—lIn the 
minds of thoughtful men, there may 
be some doubt as to which has con- 
tributed most to civilization, Thomas 
Edison the electrician, or John Dewey 
the philosopher; but there is not the 
slightest shadow of a doubt in the 
minds of the mass of 100% Americans. 
—Peccavi! We didn’t think there was 
brains and gumption enough in a 
Washington jury to do it; but Fall 
fell, Doheny swore and_ Sinclair 
grinned in his pharmacy.—Fools tried 
to give Briand a long-earned rest and 
are now wondering why.—Food com- 
bines increase and so do the hungry. 
—The world war is now being con- 
tinued in the World Bank.—A bank 
chauffeur took $63,000 and so did the 
Superintendent of Banks; watch the 
difference.—Can‘t you see savants of 
3029 A.D. pondering the puzzle? 
They stuffed 5 million people into 
New York and then hired experts to 
transport them out again at a cost of a 
thousand million dollars; no wonder 
insanity increased in those ancient 
days!

Moorfield Story—one of God’s gentlemen; born in 1845 and dead in 1929; an aristocrat of the sort that makes 
Aristocracy the perfect flower of universal Democracy; with a physical manhood, fine in face and feature, tall, 
lean and groomed: modest with every dignity; soft-voiced and full of kingly courtesy; one without fear—neither of 
gods, devils nor men; and certainly with no craven fright lest his own integrity and self-esteem could ever be threat- 
ened or overthrown by granting to all men of every color and breed, equality of pride and privilege and every width 
of opportunity that their souls demand. 

Heir to the spirit of the Great Emancipator; secretary to Charles Sumner; leader of the Bar; fighter for Civil 
Service Reform and foe of Imperial aggression on the poor and weak; first President of the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People, and the only man of his station with the guts to head so hated a horde ;—here 
was a 20th Century Knight of Heaven’s own Round Table: not satisfied with parade and fanfare and false front for 
causes already won; but a Knight who took his lonely stand out on the edge of Darkness and championed lazy 
Indians and impudent Philippinos and rape-full “ Niggers’—fought for them with brain and wealth and ecstacy of strained 
strength, when fighting cost blood and the high-nosed contempt of that sort of cattle who murder Saccos and Vanzettis. 

Beautiful, is it not, for such a leader of Lost Causes to rest his long lance and sheath his mighty sword at Christ- 
mastide, when the snow is singing to Death and the grey sky weeping above forests draped black; when the Crimson 


Christ, forever and forever crucified, is born again to blood and tears, bringing to this Hell of America, not Peace, but 
a Sword?

HE economic order is today so stu- 

pendous in its proportions that 
individual thinkers too often look upon 
the economic future of the Negro with 
a fatalistic attitude, and resign them- 
selves to a distant economic failure of 
the Negro, or with an optimistic illus- 
ion comfort themselves in feeling that 
in the economic evolution all will turn 
out well with the Negro some day 
anyway. 

To “the man in the streets”, this 
whole economic situation concerning 
the Negro is bewildering; and nearly 
every man today is a “man in the 
street”, as far as economics is con- 
cerned. Even the ablest of our leaders 
in finance and in business and the most 
competent of our economists and so- 
ciologists offer only partial and tenta- 
tive analyses of the acute economic sit- 
uations and their consequent economic 
and social pressure in Negro life. In 
most cases the best of the analyses of 
the major economic difficulties of the 
Negro life are unsatisfactory even to 
their authors. 


In the course of evolution man has 
built up a net work of institutions that 
tend to regularize and control the eco- 
nomic activities of his daily life. The 
present social-economic order is char- 
acterized by division of labor, exchange, 
legal contracts and agreements, eco- 
nomic classes, private property, vested 
interests, inheritance, competition, co- 
operation, monopoly, large scale indus- 
try, self interest, the wage system, 
freedom of contract, state regulation, 
and numerous other institutions and 
practices that influence economic and 
industrial relations. 


Restricted Occupational Life 


N general, economic and industrial 

problems arise out of the inherent 
difficulties connected with economic 
activities in the production, exchange 
and distribution of wealth. Affecting 
the Negro, there are, however, addi- 
tional peculiar problems and difficulties 
not inherent in the economic and in-

December, 


W.C. Matney is at the head of 
the Business Department of Blue- 
field Colored Institute, West Vir- 
ginia. His article on the success of 
his Students’ Co-operative Store, 
published in the Crisis, was wide- 
ly read. The essay published this 
month won the first Prize in our 
Economics Prize Contest. 

Mr. Matney is the only expert

Crisis knows about. 


dustrial order. ‘These difficulties may 
be listed under two major headings: 
problems and difficulties of the Negro’s 
own making; economic problems and 
difficulties thrust upon the Negro. To 
state the latter differently, it may be 
said that the Negro is denied the Free- 
dom of Contract and Free Enterprise 
in the economic order that has as its 
basis, Freedom of Contract and Free- 
dom of Enterprise. Denial of Free- 
dom of Contract in the major fields of 
industry, namely: production in the 
basic industries, manufacturing, trans- 
portation, storage, wholesaling, retail- 
ing, risk bearing, banking and finan- 
cing, simply means limitation in the 
production of wealth. Limitation in 
the production of wealth results in 
limitation in the control of wealth. 

Neither the Negro laborer nor the 
Negro capitalist escape the denial of 
Freedom of Contract or the Freedom 
of Enterprise; black capital must suffer 
as does black labor in the economic or- 
der. Let us consider the following 
table of earnings per hour per em- 
ployee in industries in the United 
States, and see if he is in these indus- 
tries where compensation is high.

An examination of the above table 
shows that the Negro is most fre- 
quently found in large numbers in 
those industries where the pay is low, 
and there he is found doing common 
labor or receiving the pay of the com- 
mon laborer, In the building, construc- 
tion, and hand trades he is hampered by 
trade unions. In transportation he is 
entirely excluded by the railroad 
unions, has a poor chance as laborer, 
and is at the mercy of the public as 
personal service renderer. In factories 
where the pay is good, the Negro is 
also confronted with the union. Only 
in the open shop does the Negro have 
a chance, and this chance must not con- 
flict with the chance of his white com- 
petitor. 

Intense conflict or competition with 
the white competitor frequently results 
in race riots, the ‘“‘cause’”’ of which is 
‘rape’. In the non-union mine fields 
the Negro has a fair chance, in that the 
personal contact is of a lesser degree 
than in factories and other industries. 
In the general field of personal service 
outside of the Negro group, the Negro 
has a chance as servant or porter, re- 
ceiving the relatively small compensa- 
tion for his services. In agriculture the 
wages to Negro labor are pitifully low. 
“In 1919, an unusually prosperous year 
in the South, farmers’ incomes in the 
South were about one-third of those in 
Illinois, lowa and Nebraska. The low 
incomes of croppers, Negroes and poor 
labor on southern farms pulls down 
the average which the corn belt farms 
tend to attain’”.® 

The position of the Negro in the 
economic order is well summarized by 
Dr. Charles H. Wesley: “Capitalism 
through human bondage, a debasing 
wage slavery, and a restricted occupa- 
tional life has made possible the con- 
tinual exploitation of its black workers, 
who struggle not only against the usual 
obstacles of the average American 
workingman but also against the spec- 
ial handicaps of race and color”.*

ficulty in making the dollar in the re-

stricted industrial field, let us now 
follow the dollar when it is spent. Let 
us consider the dollar as it is spent for a 
few of the necessities for which we have 
statistics. This is not only the Ne- 
groes’ dollar but anybody’s dollar. But 
the peculiar significance of the Ne- 
groes’ dollar is that in its redundant 
course it returns to the restricted 
dustrial field leaving him an exploited 
cog in the industrial wheel.

The foregoing tables present typical 
samples of the Negroes’ dollar traveling 
back to the sources where he has great 
difficulty of having a meager chance 
to receive a pittance of it for his labor 
in producing the commodities. In 
other words, he is spending in an “open 
market” and being forced to produce 
his wealth in a highly restricted and 
“protected market”. The “open mar- 
ket” for spending is only open in cer- 
tain instances. It is restricted in the 
field of certain personal service and 
where social intercourse is part of the 
business transaction, or where the Ne- 
gro residence or business building 
chances to be in “‘a white section”. The 
technique of restriction takes many 
forms:* (1) Segregation laws or or- 
dinances, (2) deed restrictions, (3) 
social pressure, (4) violence. Under 
the present economic system the white 
consumer’s freedom of choice is limited 
only by his income; the Negro’s free- 
dom of choice is limited by his income 
and in addition by the color of his skin. 
The Negro’s greatest freedom of choice 
$s in not choosing at all. 


The Negro in Business 


N the field of business, prejudice 

against patronizing Negroes forces 
the Negro to confine his business ac- 
tivities within his own group. The 
early Negro businesses catering to 
white trade have almost entirely dis- 
appeared. White people entered the 


5 Joint Commission of Agricultural Inquiry, 1921, 
Volume III, Marketing of Agricultural Products.

same lines of business, and drove out 
most of their small Negro competitors 
by the application of superior business 
ability and the possession of more capi- 
tal. Prejudice against patronizing Ne- 
groes played an important part. Many 
of the Negro business men remained in 
business catering to Negro trade. The 
exclusion of Negroes from white in- 
surance companies brought into exist- 
ence secret orders emphasizing the sick 
benefit and industrial insurance fea- 
tures. 


These lodges were the training 
ground for Negro insurance com- 
panies and later separate insurance 
companies developed. It is in the in- 
surance field that the Negro has made 
the “grade” in business. So we find 
that the Negro built considerable busi- 
ness in various fields on “race pride” 
appeal wherever he was threatened 
with white competition. It may be 
also noted that Negro business pros- 
pered most in those sections of the 
country where race prejudice was 
greatest, and where Negro population 
was most dense. 

The census of 1920 indicates the 
following distribution of principal Ne- 
gro businesses:

In the past few years certain eco- 
nomic developments have occurred that 
have affected the retail business of the 
Negro, and hold promise of putting 
his retail business in a more precarious 
position in the future. A few of the 
developments are the urbanization of 
the Negro, chain store competition, and 
the invasion of chain stores into the 
South, the extension of retail stores by 
large mail order houses, and self ser- 
vice stores. The economic pressure on 
the Negro consumer, and the savings 
that the foregoing stores make possible, 
means that race appeal will not carry 
the Negro merchant through and en- 
able him to receive the slightly higher 
price which he is forced to charge by 
virtue of the inherent weakness of his 
small scale business. Competition in 
business is keener for the Negro than 
in any profession or vocation. It re- 
quires more than just the ability to sell 
to conduct business successfully. One 
must be able to buy well, which means 
having many contacts and the access to 
necessary credit. One must be able to 
appraise the value of advertising and 
have sufficient capital to make it pro- 
ductive. One must accept a large 


number of small profits instead of a 
small number of large profits. 

In 1925 it was estimated that there 
were 4,000 chain store systems in the 
United States with a total of over 65, 
000 stores.’ Since that date there has 
been a continued increase in the rela- 
tive importance of the chain store. In 
1925 the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea 
Company operated 12,000 grocery 
stores. The First National Stores op- 
erated 1,636 groceries, 12 meat mar- 
kets and 9 restaurants, and the Na- 
tional Stores had 784 stores.’ It is 
estimated that 50 per cent of the total 
chain retail units are operated by gro- 
cery chains.° The chain groceries buy 
five-sixths of their stocks from manu- 
facturers, eliminating the wholesalers, 
while the unit stores buy from 70 per 
cent to 80 per cent of their stocks from 
wholesalers.?° 


Big Business and Big Profits 


SURVEY appearing recently in 

the New York Times showed the 
results of a study made of chain store 
development in the United States. 
Sixty-four thousand stores are now op- 
erated by 860 such companies for gro- 
ceries alone, with annual sales of $2,- 
356,000,000. This means that more 
than one-third of the entire grocery 
trade of the country is done by the gro- 
cery chains. Of every dollar spent in 
all kinds of retail stores today, 17 cents 
goes to some kind of chain store. 

The first table which follows shows 
the distribution of such companies ac- 
cording to business handled, and the 
second, the strength of certain of the 
strongest of all chains.

Elizabeth Prophet, Sculptor 


LIZABETH PROPHET is a 

brown woman born in Providence, 
Rhode Island. From early years her 
fingers longed to express her thought 
and fantasy in plastic form. Her fam- 
ily was indifferent and their white 
friends quite indignant. Here was a 
girl who would have made an excellent 
and intelligent servant; or she might 
have been a fairly well-paid teacher, 
teaching, of course, not in Rhode 
Island, but among “her people”. 

But Elizabeth Prophet would have 
none of these things. She was a stern, 
self-willed girl. She wanted to be a 
sculptor. She is a sculptor. She stud- 
ied at the Rhode Island School of De- 
sign and then, almost without money, 
without friends, and frail of physique, 
she went to Europe. In Paris, she en- 


tered the celebrated Ecole des Beaux- 
Arts, and she is today called in lead- 
ing reviews “one of the most expressive 
sculptors of this generation, from be- 
yond the sea.” 

She made her first appearance in the 
Paris Salon d’Automn in 1924. Since 
then, she has exhibited in the Salon 
d’Automn and the Salon des Artists 
Francais. She sent some work last 
February to the Annual Exhibition of 
the Boston Society of Independent 
Artists. The Boston Evening Tran- 
script said: “In sculpture there were 
but two things of importance: One was 
the head of a Cossack; the other, the 
head of a Negro cut in wood. The 
letter was a powerful thing—one of the 
few outstanding things in the show. 
It was done by Elizabeth Prophet.”

Sculpture in wood. By Elisabeth Prophet 


The Paris critics have been out- 
spoken concerning Elizabeth Prophet. 
Raymond Selig and Jules de Saint- 
Hilaire say in the Revue du Vrai et du 
Beau: 

“The bust of a man in marble which 
the perfect sculptor, Elizabeth Prophet, 
is exhibiting in the Salon des Artists 
Francais, is most impressive. I have 
not yet seen during my visit a single 
work so characteristic. I have been 
infinitely happy to ‘discover’ this bust, 
so arousingly beautiful, vigorous and 
energetic; a bust which is, in my opin- 
ion, one of the most attractive examples 
of the artistic productions brought to- 
gether in the Salon. The figure is con- 
ceived in a nervous style, supple and 
sure; the composition is most adroit, as 
is the modeling of the whole in its pure 
lines. There are no mannerisms in 
Elizabeth Prophet’s art, and yet the 
work is gracefully voluptuous. It de- 
notes a sure knowledge and full mas- 
tery of method. The artist by this 
work, which I so sincerely admire, has 
almost become a master of sculptural 
expression.” 

Speaking of the difficulty of sculp- 
ture with various materials, the Paris 
Revue Moderne lauds Elizabeth 
Prophet for the way in which she has 
handled wood. “Her works lacks 
neither ebullient youth nor well-di- 
rected force. The head in ebony is a 
charming head of a young girl with the 
pure lines and the grace of adolescence. 
All of Elizabeth Prophet’s work is full 
of allure and character.”

N 1901, John Mitchell, Jr., Editor of 

the Richmond Planet, incorporated 
the Mechanics’ Savings Bank of Rich- 
mond, which was capitalized for $25,- 
000 and began business in a basement 
with three rooms at 511 North 3rd 
Street, January 1, 1902. The annual 
deposits increased from $122,915 in 
1902, to $480,062 in 1909. The bank 
then determined to erect a modern 
building and this building was finished 
in 1910. 

It was four stories high with a roof 
garden and built of white compressed 
brick with granite trimmings and col- 
umns and pilasters in front of pink 
marble. It was a beautiful building, 
at the corner of 3rd and Clay Street, 
with fine bank fixtures, elevators, and 
four office suites and twenty-four single 
offices. 

The bank prospered for twenty 
years, and then in 1922, it got into 
trouble with the State Banking Depart- 
ment. The banking laws of Virginia 
are loosely drawn and still more loosely 
admigistered. The President of the 
Mechanics’ Savings Bank had bought 
a former white theater down in the 
business district and the Banking De- 
partment objected to the method by 
which this property was carried on the 
books of the bank. Controversy en- 
sued, and suddenly the Banking De- 
partment closed the bank, July 15, 
1922, and made an investigation, find- 
ing certain alleged violations of the 
banking laws. 

The result was that the Mechanics’ 
Savings Bank permanently went out of 
business. The building and other real 
estate holdings were sold and a divi- 
dend of 40 per cent on deposits was 
paid. There was great suffering among 
the colored people on account of this 
unfortunate disaster, and since then 
this large and beautiful building has 
stood as a sort of mournful monument. 


The Mechanics Bank Building of Richmond 





Lhe new Home Office building of the Southern Aid Society of Virginia, formerly the 
Mechanics Bank Building, Richmond 


On September 23, 1929, there came 
a sudden and pleasing change. ‘The 
Southern Aid Society of Virginia was 
chartered, February 10, 1893, with a 
capital stock of $5,000. This capital 
has now been increased to $150,000, 
fully paid-in, and the Society has to- 
tal assets of $990,333, liabilities of 
$655,834, and a surplus of $334,499. 
Its capital and surplus together amount 
to $484,499, and it has paid in claims, 
up to December 31, 1928, $5,182,240. 

This organization has as its officers, 
James T. Carter, President, Edward 
Steward, B. A. Cephas and A. Wash- 
ington, Vice Presidents, and B. L. Jor- 
dan and W. A. Jordan as Secretary and 


Executive officials of the Southern Aid Society of Virginia 


Assistant Secretary. Recently, the 
stockholders have approved the entry 
of this company into the life insur- 
ance field, and an application for this 
change in the charter has been granted 
by the State Corporation Commission. 
They will write straight life insurance, 
beginning January, 1930. 

The Southern Aid Society, on Sep- 
tember 23, bought the building of the 
former Mechanics’ Bank as its future 
home office and will install the Com- 
mercial Bank and Trust Company in 
the banking quarters.

Company was organized by a group of

SWAYING PUBLIC OPINION 
UBLIC OPINION was more 


than swayed. It blew for a while 
with the force of a West Indian hurri- 
cane. And the storm is slow in blow- 
ing over. All over an incident that 
was seemingly trivial when it occurred. 
That incident was the announcement 
in the Protestant Episcopal Church of 
St. Matthew’s, Brooklyn, by its rector, 
the Rev. William S. Blackshear, late 
of Texas, that colored people had 
better not join his church. They were 
not wanted. They had better go to 
their own churches in the neighbor- 
hood. The Rev. Mr. Blackshear in- 
tended to keep the racial “integrity” of 
his parish “pure”. 

The challenge to this announcement 
was prompt. The National Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People promptly communicated with 
the vestry of St. Matthew’s Church, 
asking that the rector’s utterance be 


December, 1920 


disavowed, as constituting “Jim-Crow 
Christianity”; and that the rector be 
dismissed. 

Now if the N. A. A. C. P. had 
been a small, fly-by-night organization, 
with a paper membership, and a record 
of ineffectual protest, this challenge 
would not have attracted much atten- 
tion. But the N. A. A. C. P. in its 
twenty years, has made its mark in the 
field of race relations. It has won 
many victories both in the highest 
courts of the land and in the court of 
public opinion. Years of careful work 
have established in the minds of news- 
paper editors throughout the United 
States that the N. A. A. C. P. is care- 
ful about what it says and about how 
it says what it has to say. So the N. 
A. A. C. P. statements were featured 
in the press throughout the country. 

Moreover, the N. A. A. C. P. car- 
ried the appeal beyond the vestry of St. 
Matthew’s Church to the Rt. Rev. 
Ernest M. Stires, Bishop of the Diocese 
of Long Island. And the N. A. A. C. 
P. communication was important 
enough for the Bishop to reply to by 
special delivery letter. For the N. A. 
A. C. P. maintained that the utterance 
of the Rev. Blackshear raised the ques- 
tion of the real meaning of Christianity 
as expounded by the Protestant Epis- 
copal Church. 

All the correspondence, between the 
N. A. A. C. P. and the vestry and be- 
tween the N. A. A. C. P. and Bishop 
Stires—who held such an utterance as 
the Rev. Mr. Blackshear’s to be “‘in- 
defensible’ —found its way into the 
newspapers. Not only that, but citi- 
zens began writing letters to editors, 
clergymen of all denominations began 
speaking plainy; and the editors them- 
selves did not remain silent. The New 
York Evening Post, for example, pub- 
lished three separate editorials, back- 
ing up the N. A. A.C. P. The World 
had two editorials. The Nation, and 
dozens of other publications through- 
out the country, some in the South, 
some for, some against, commented 
upon the issue. Heywood Broun, in 
his syndicated articles for the Scripps- 
Howard chain of newspapers, devoted 
four days to discussion of the incident. 

The issue was placed by the N. A. 
A. C. P. squarely before the House of 
Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal 
Church, in session in Atlantic City, 
and that body, though it evaded dis- 
cussion of the incident, had to face its 
significance. 

For thirteen consecutive days in the 


month of September, and even into 
October, the N. A. A. C. P. was fea- 
tured daily in the metropolitan news- 
papers as leading in the fight. And, 
so far as one can judge by what is pub- 
lished, public opinion overwhelmingly 
supports the position the Association 
has taken. Nothing the N. A. A. C. P. 
has ever done has stirred such interest. 
Nor has any such gale of public senti- 
ment blown in its favor—in favor that 
is, of the plain dictates of justice and 
decency to all people irrespective of 
color. 

A new turn was given the contro- 
versy, when Monsignor John L. Bel- 
ford, pastor of a Catholic Church in 
Brooklyn, announced that he sympa- 
tised with the Rev. Mr. Blackshear, 
and that if Negroes became ‘“‘numer- 
ous” in his church they would be ex- 
cluded. Again there was a flurry in 
the newspapers. Again the N. A. A. 
C. P. appealed to a high dignitary of 
the church, Cardinal Patrick J. Hayes. 
And, as Bishop Stires had done for the 
Protestant Episcopal Church, Cardinal 
Hayes, just prior to his sailing for 
Rome, directed and authorized a letter 
to the N. A. A. C. P., repudiating the 
utterances of Msgr. Belford, and mak- 
ing clear that they did not represent 
the policy and the spirit of the Catholic 
Church. 

High dignitaries in two denomina- 
tions, the Protestant Episcopal and the 
Catholic, have therefore responded to 
the protests of the N. A. A. C. P. by 
repudiating the race prejudice expres- 
sed by lesser dignitaries. And the pub- 
lic, through newspapers and magazines, 
has been fully advised of every step in 
this viétorious campaign of the N. A. 
A; C.F. 

This victory did not just happen. 
The N. A. A. C. P. made the issue 
and won its case. That was because 
the significance of a seemingly trivial 
occurrence was clearly seen the moment 
it happened. That incident was dram- 
atised for hundreds of thousands of 
people. It made them think and feel. 
And out of it has come a live state of 
public opinion, on an issue which be- 
fore then had been dormant. 

Whether colored people are discour- 
aged from joining the parish of St. 
Matthew’s in Brooklyn, is less im- 
portant than that the Catholic Church, 
the Protestant Episcopal Church and 
other denominations have been faced 
with the issue of race discrimination in 
its ranks. Anxious soul-searching has

Camille Cohen 


By WENDELL PHILLIPS DABNEY 


N New Orleans, the Eden of creoles, 

where the blood of all races has 
brought to glorious radiance the beauty 
of woman, Camille Cohen laughed her 
way into life, budded, blossomed, and 
flowered. 

She was born on New Year’s Day, 
1884, in the home of Walter L. Cohen 
and his wife, Wilhelmina—Walter 
Cohen, who is easily the most level- 
headed and successful colored politician 
of the South and now holds the office 
of Comptroller of Customs of the Port 
of New Orleans. 

The school career of Camille Cohen 
was brief but interesting. First, she 
attended Mrs. Lena Burrell’s French 
School for Creoles. Then she went to 
Straight University and was graduated 
at eighteen. She was especially adept 
in the languages, and English, French 
and Spanish all seemed her mother 
tongue. Music, both of voice and 
piano, were her recreations. 

Her life work began with her entry 
into her father’s office as clerk. There 
she fell in love with Alva Bell, and 
then followed the birth of Yolande. 
The marriage was not successful, and 
was followed in a few years by di- 
vorce. Then came several years as 
school teacher, and finally, Camille be- 
came her father’s private secretary. He 
was a master politician, and what she 
did not inherit of knowledge of politics 
from him, she rapidly acquired. Her 
father was at that time president of 
the People’s Benevolent and Industrial 
Insurance Company of Louisiana, and 


A 


66 HE hardest bump that was ever 

handed to me came on the day 
on which I received my B. A. degree 
from the University of California in 
1924, when a white co-ed refused to 
“walk with me to the stadium. In or- 
der to facilitate the handing out of the 
diplomas it is customary for the mem- 
bers of the graduating class to line up 
in couples alphabetically before the 
ceremonies begin and to receive their 
credentials in the same order. Fate 
selected as my partner a young woman 
from the South who had inherited 
strong race prejudice, thus creating a 
situation extremely embarrassing to us 
both. Fortunately for me, while I was 
looking for a way out of a predicament 
for which I was in no way responsible, 


410 


Camille Cohen 


for eleven years Camille was virtually 
in charge of the organization. Then, 
love sang its siren song again, and she 
married Oscar D. Jones and came to 
live in Chicago. 

There, the Camille Cohen Jones’ 
Music School for Girls was her first 
experiment. But, after all, Camille 
Cohen with her great executive ability, 


her variety of talents and mercurial 
temperament, was never suited to the 
banal formalities of school life. The 
Cohen blood was too strong. Politics 
continually beckoned her like “‘the Call 
of the Wild.” Soon, she was in the 
whirling stream of Chicago political 
life, and was quickly known to every 
candidate and worker. She figured 
conspiciously in the campaign of 1924, 
with organization and personal contacts 
and political speeches. But all this 
could not satisfy the variety of her 
talents. In her spare moments, she was 
with the Big Sisters, the Catholic 
Church and the Louisiana Social and 
Benevolent Club with its 350 sons and 
daughters, which she founded and led. 

Then, quite suddenly, in the midst 
of her manifold activities, illness came. 
Her exuberant vitality was sapped 
slowly, gradually, but painlessly. Her 
daughter, Yolande, had married Paul 
E. Johnson, who manufactures Violet 
Ray lamps, and is known as a tireless 
inventor and business man. ‘Together, 
they gave every attention their affection 
or money could offer but Camille lit- 
erally faded away, until one year ago, 
“God touched her with his finger and 
she slept.” 

She was magnificent in her woman- 
hood—a dark Brunhilda, handsome, 
large and free; full of joy and laugh- 
ter, frank and fearless, never biting her 
tongue; and yet one who was never 
still, never dull, always going and doing 
and dreaming; always alive, always 
generous, loving and kind. 


Young Lawyer 


By HENRY STAUFFER 


a lady member of the class who did not 
despise me on account of my color, 
stepped up saying, ‘I know Mr. John- 
son and shall consider it an honor to 
walk with him.’ I had never met her 
before and have often wished I knew 
who she was and where she lived in 
order that I might thank her for an act 
of courtesy I shall never forget.” 

Thus spoke George M. Johnson, the 
young Negro who has just completed 
the course in the law department of the 
University of California, regarding one 
of the most trying episodes of his life. 

Mr. Johnson was born in Albu- 
querque, New Mexico, of intelligent 
parents, his mother being a graduate 
of a state normal school who taught for 


some years in Dallas, Texas, before her 
marriage. In his childhood his parents 
moved to San Bernardino, California, 
where his father is employed by the 
Santa Fé Railroad Company. While 
he was a pupil in the San Bernardino 
High School, three events occurred 
which largely shaped his career. The 
famous Fisk Male Quartette sang to 
the school and received enthusiastic ap- 
plause; he read the stimulating auto- 
biography of that great Negro leader, 
Booker T. Washington; and one day 
his teacher in public speaking, Miss 
Freeman, expressed her appreciation of 
his ability to think clearly and speak 
effectively. Her magical words touched

Colored Girls in Cleveland 


HE problem of the colored girl in 
a Northern great city is in 
many ways more pressing than that of 
the young man. It is difficult for 
working girls to get proper rooms and 
boarding places. They are open to in- 
sult and even attack from the irre- 
sponsible elements of both races. And, 
above all, it is peculiarly easy for them 
to drift into questionable company and 
into social surroundings which might 
ultimately prove fatal. 

What is to be done about it? The 
Y, W. C. A. is one answer. But in 
nearly all cities, these Associations dis- 
criminate against colored girls. They 
say frankly: If we admit colored girls, 
the white girls will not come. To meet 
this discrimination, separate institu- 
tions have been started in many cities; 
some of these are frankly called 
“colored” Y. W. C. A.’s. Other take 
particular names, like the Phillis 
Wheatley House of Washington, 
BD; <2. 

Certain cities, like Boston and Cleve- 
land, have for a long time fought this 
sort of discrimination. They have de- 
clared that in principle the Y. W. C. 
A. has no right to discriminate and 
that, therefore, they would not consent 
to a separate Y. W. C. A. based on 
race and color. There is absolutely no 
doubt of the logical consistency of this 
stand. But there is grave doubt as to 
its results. Colored girls have been go- 
ing to Boston and literally pouring into 
Cleveland. The demand for their pro- 
tection and comfort is insistent. Un- 
less something is done for them the 
harm to succeeding generations is in- 
calculable. 


Moreover, this situation is different 
from that of the public schools. Ne- 
groes in the North can legally force 
themselves into the public school and 
if they are persistent and diligent can 
compell decent treatment of their chil- 
dren and the appointment of colored 
teachers on the same terms as other 
teachers are appointed. This has been 
proven in New York, Chicago, Boston, 
and even in Cleveland. 


But semi-private philanthropies, like 
the Christian Associations can only 
with the greatest difficulty be coerced 
into decency; and meantime our boys 
and girls go to the devil. 


This is the kind of dilemma that 
faces the colored people of America 
continually, and in Cleveland, Jane 
Hunter offered a solution in 1913. 

Many people disagreed with her 
then and many do disagree with her 
now, but they have to admit that Jane 
Hunter has done an astonishing and 
valuable piece of work. What she did 


December, 1929 


was simple. She formed in 1913 a 
“Phillis Wheatley Association”. It 
was not connected with the Y. W. C. 
A., but was an entirely separate ven- 
ture, doing similar work. It was a 
place where colored girls could lodge 
while they were working or seeking 
work and it was also a center where 
white people could hire servants. Then 
the place began to grow. It had a bud- 
get of $1,500 for its first year and 
housed 22 girls. In 1917, it was neces- 
sary to purchase a building much larger 
and better fitted to accommodate the 
ever increasing number of girls. 
Through the contributions of friends, 
mainly white, this. building was pur- 
chased. In 1918, the Association be- 
came a member of the Cleveland Wel- 
fare Federation and began to receive 
in this way public aid. 

In 1919, there was need for the ex- 


pansion of the educational work. An 
adjoining building was purchased for 
the purpose of housing the clubs and 
classes. Again in 1924, the institution 
had outgrown its quarters and it was 
necessary to go before the public for 
capital funds. In January, 1925, a 
capital campaign was conducted and 
$663,000 was pledged to erect a new 
home with adequate equipment. To- 
day, $508,156.23 of this has been col- 
lected. 

The Association, now, enjoys the dis- 
tinction of being probably the best de- 
veloped piece of social work for col- 
ored girls and women in the United 
States. The new nine-story building 
beautifully and adequately furnished is 
a real lighthouse in Cleveland. 

There are many departments of 
work: In the educational department 
no attempt is made to duplicate the

work which is given in the public 
schools, but the idea is to supplement 
the public schools and give girls and 
young women a chance to find them- 
selves. 

In “addition to the various clubs, 
classes are taught in domestic science, 
sewing, art, music, and dramatics. Dur- 
ing the past year a nurses registry has 
been formed. 

The Employment Department has 
found jobs for large numbers of wom- 
en. In 1928, 1,455 women applied for 
work and of these, 1,270 were placed. 
There is a division of Girl Reserves, 
with club activities, which include 
sports, nature study and handicraft. 

The most interesting and spectacular 
part of the plant is the cafeteria. It 
serves three meals a day, catering to 
both men and women. In addition to 
the main dining room, there are two 
private dining rooms for special occas- 
ions. In 1928, 48,375 meals were 
served. The cafeteria is self-support- 
ing and contributes to the maintenance 
of other departments. 

Living quarters are provided for self- 
supporting women at a cost of $2.75 
to $7.00 per week. There is 24-hour 
office and elevator service and attrac- 
téve parlors and club rooms. On every 
floor there is hot and cold water. 

Naturally, the main branch of the 
Association is not large enough for all 
of the activities. The Kingsley-Arter 
Center has been started at East 100th 
Street with an educational program 
similar to the Central branch. Near 
this is a large and well-equipped play- 
ground, attended by 6,808 children 
during the summer of 1928. 

There are three large and enthusi- 
astic Mother’s Clubs, who are inter- 
ested in character-building programs, 


412 


and in general support of the work. 
Two miles east of Lorain, Ohio, over- 
looking Lake Erie, is Camp Merriam. 
This is the summer camp of the Phillis 
Wheatley Association. It can accom- 
modate, in tents, 100 people, and lias a 
dining hall and recreation hall. Swim- 
ming, boating, hiking, tennis, baseball, 
nature study, and other amusements 
are provided at a low rate. Eleven 
thousand meals were served at the camp 
in the summer of 1928.

THE BROWSING READER 


HE Book of the Month is Coun- 
tée Cullen’s “The Black Christ 
and other poems’, published by Harper 
and Brothers at $2.00. The main 
poem is “Hopefully Dedicated to 
White Americans”. It is a poem of 
religious mysticism, of beauty and fin- 
ish. We quote a few lines: 
‘T have a fear,” he used to say, 
“This thing may come to me some day. 
Some man contemptuous of my race 
And its lost rights in this hard place, 
Will strike me down for being black. 
But when I answer I'll pay back 
The late revenge long overdue 
A thousand of my kind and hue. 
A thousand black men, long since gone 
Will guide my hand, stiffen the brawn, 
And speed one life-divesting blow 
Into some granite face of snow. 
And I may swing, but not before 
I send some pale ambassador 
Hot footing it to hell to say 
A proud black man is on his way.” 

“Pathfinders: The Progress of Col- 
ored Graduate Nurses”, by Adah B. 
Thoms, is a privately printed history 
by the woman who for eighteen years 
was Assistant Superintendent of Nurses 
at Lincoln Hospital. It is an excel- 
lent and inspiring record, with an in- 
troduction by Lillian D. Wald: 

“This short history of nursing is 
presented not only as a record of the 
struggles and achievements of profes- 
sional nurses, but also as a foundation 
stone in racial progress—for nurses 
have contributed much in the past to 
the advancement of the race, and, if 
the scope of their activities is enlarged, 
they can render an even greater service 
in the future.” 

William Henry Jones continues his 
careful studies of Washington in “The 
Housing of Negroes in Washington, 
D.C.” The investigation was made un- 
der the auspices of the Interracial Com- 
mittee of the Washington Federation of

painstaking and thorough piece of 
work. We quote one significant para- 
graph: 

“Negroes are usually forced to buy 
homes, if they wish to live in desirable 
communities. Most of the newly con- 
structed houses are being bought in- 
stead of rented. The average home 
which is purchased by Negroes is priced 
at $7,500, but a few are priced as high 
as $25,000. Many Negroes were found 


to have purchased their homes with

cash payments of from $7,000 to $10,- 
000. The fact that 46.5 per cent of the 
homes studied were owned shows that 
the Negro population in Washington 
has a good rating in relation to proper- 
ty ownership.” 

A Southern white woman, Dorothy 
G. Bolton, has furnished the words of 
Negro hymns from her own Georgia 
plantation and elsewhere, and the well- 
known composer, Harry T. Burleigh, 
has arranged the music. The result is 
“The Old Songs Hymnal’, published 
by the Century Company, and worthy 
of wide use. 

Chester D. Heywood, white Captain 
in a black regiment has published “The 
Story of the 37\st Regiment.” It is 
not a very illuminating book and says 
nothing of the strange relations be- 
tween white officers and black soldiers 
and of the American color line trans- 
ported into the World War. Neither 
does it explain the extraordinary num- 
ber of white officers who lost their lives 
in battle. Yet there is an explanation. 
Maps and original orders are liberally 
provided. 

Blaise Cendrars, who wrote “The 
African Saga”, an anthology of last 
year, has now published through Pay- 
son and Clarke, “Little Black Stories 
for Little White Children”. The book 
has been translated from the French by 
Margery Bianco. All children will 
find these stories beautiful. 

The Methodist Book Concern has is- 
sued a pamphlet, “The American 
Negro”. It is a series of worship ser- 
vices to be used in the Junior Depart- 
ment of the church. It has excerpts 
and quotations, calculated to interest 
young folk in the Negro. The quota- 
tions are somewhat over-edited, as in 
the case of Brenda Moryck’s “Days”, 
but, on the whole, the pamphlet is 
worth while. 

Evans Wall has published a novel 








“The No Nation Girl’ ; it is the usual 
white Southerner’s idea of the mulat- 
to’s going “native”. Everybody com- 
mits suicide at the end of the story. 

J. J. Harmon, Jr., Arnette G. Lin- 
say and Carter G. Woodson, have 
united in writing a pamphlet on “The 
Negro As A Business Man’’, published 
by the Association for the Study of Life 
and History. It is an excellent and 
accurate compendium. 

From “The Scourge of Christ” 
By Paul Richard 

Legal murder is the legitimate father 
of the illegal ones. 

The punishment that imitates the 
crime, justifies it. 

To avoid recognition, Cain today 
covers himself with a uniform. 

“Civilization’—the privilege of a 
few peoples estimated by the number of 
their firearms. 

“Barbarism’’—not to have firearms 
up to date. 

“Woe unto the rich” Jesus said this 
—not Lenin. 

When the rich concern themselves 
with the business of the poor it is called 
charity. When the poor concern them- 
selves with the business of the rich it is 
called anarchy. 

“High standard of life’—an ad- 
vanced state of spiritual death. 

Several men betrayed Jesus, but not 
one woman. 

To love Christ is to find Christians 
unbearable. 

“Christian”—one who believes that 
Christ was like him. 

I have met only two men who were 
like the Christ: one was a Hindu, the 
other a Mussulman. 

Christ rose against all that would ex- 
alt itself. 

“Bible” —a paper Pope. 

Nations do not go to Hell; Hell 
comes to them when they sin. 

“Colonies’—far off countries in 
which the clothes of Europeans turn 
white and their hearts, black. 

The Christianity of Christ died when 
Asia ceased to teach it. 

“Colour prejudice’”—a kind of skin 
disease especially malignant among 
white peoples. 

When Asia tries to attain to the 
barbarism of Europe, they say she is 
becoming civilized. 

All that is, was; and will be, whether 
in form or without form. 

We are in the Infinite: no one can 
be lost.

together with an African Museum. 

@ It is reported that the League of 
Nations has consented to appoint a 
Commission to investigate the alleged 
slavery in Liberia. The commissioners 
will be three, one representing the 
League; one, the American Govern- 
ment and one, the Liberian Govern-

@ A conference of the International 
Fellowship of Reconciliation was held 
in Lyons, France, last August. It was 
attended by 135 persons, representing 
twenty countries. Among the activities 
recommended to its members were the 
following: 

“Aiding movements for the freeing of 
exploited colonial peoples from alien 
control by imperialist powers; for oppos- 
ing race discrimination and for aiming at 
cooperation between races.”

@ The Bureau of Education has made 
a study of Medical Education in the 
United States. It reports that during 
the past five years, 2,644 Negro stu- 
dents have been enrolled and 586 have 
been given degrees. Of these, 2,193 
were enrolled in two Negro medical 
schools and 475 graduated from them. 


In the other schools of the United 
States and Canada, there have been 451 
students and 111 graduates. 

@ On an average during the last five 
years, there have been each year 529 
Negro medical students enrolled and 
117 graduated. The distribution of 
these students and graduates from 1923 
to 1928 have been as follows:

@ Prison statistics in the United 
States are very incomplete and unsatis- 
factory. They represent only a few 
of the law-breakers, many of whom are 
not arrested, others not brought to 
trial, others not convicted and still 
others obtain their freedom by paying 
fines. In 1926, of the prisoners re-

ceived in ninety-six prisons and_ re- 
formatories of the United States, 
9,274 or 21.4 per cent, were of Negro 
descent. In 1923, the proportion was 
24 per cent. Of the male Negro pris- 
oners, 24 per cent were incarcerated 
for stealing, 19 percent for burglary, 12 
per cent for homicide, and 11 per cent 
for fighting. It is interesting to note 
that only 2.6 per cent of the Negroes 
are charged with rape, as compared 
with 4 per cent of the native whites, 
5.5 per cent of the foreign-born whites 
and 9.4 per cent of the Indians. Col- 
ored women are mainly charged with 
stealing, killing, fighting and violation 
of liquor laws. 

@ There are four Educational Boards 
and Foundations especially interested 
in Negroes. The General Education 
Board from 1902-28, spent $12,991,- 
$54 on Negro institutions. The John 
F.. Slater Fund spent, 1927-28, $69,050 
tor Negro education. The Jeanes 
Fund the same year helped Negro edu- 
cation in fourteen states, and paid out 
$108,547. The Phelps-Stokes Fund 
has published no complete report of its 
expenditures. It has a capital fund of 
$1,200,000; a considerable part of its 
income goes to white people. The 
Julius Rosenwald Fund was incorpo- 
rated in 1917 and spent for the fiscal 
vear ending June 30, 1928, $364,831. 
Most of this went for Negro rural 
schoolhouses.

“A Penny for Justice” 


Buy N. A. A. C. P. Christmas 
Seals 


As an expression of Christmas 
cheer and good will. Almost every 
one at this season is sending greet- 
ings and gifts. Let yours bear the 
seal of The National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored 
people. 

During the past three years 
these seals have yielded a wealth 
of publicity and have reached per- 
sons all over the country, adver- 
tising the fact that Negroes are 
determined to continue the fight 
for their rights as American citi- 
zens and are using every effective 
means of doing so. 

The seals for 1929 are now 
ready. If you are interested in 
the cause of the Negro, add your 
“Penny for Justice”. They are put 
up in books of 200 and sell for one 
cent each or $2.00 per book. Your 
individual order will be sent by re- 
turn mail for any number of them. 
This year we hope to have the co- 
operation of Negro business, insur- 
ance companies, lodges and schools 
in handling these seals. 

The money raised will go to the 
Association to assist in carrying on 
their program. These sales may 
count as your individual effort or 
apply to your branch apportion- 
ment. Here is also a fine oppor- 
tunity to increase your quota of 
the Anniversary Fund. All money 
received from the sale of seals on 
or before December 28, 1929 will 
be credited to this fund. 

Place your order now. You 
may return any unsold seals with 
your remittance after the holidays 
are over. 

Address your orders to, Mrs. 
Memphis T. Garrison, Box 364, 
Gary, West Va. 


@ The John F. Slater Fund is using 
a part of its income now to supplement 
the salaries received by teachers in 
various Southern colleges. The indi- 
vidual grants vary from $900 a year to 
$2,250. In all, forty-three professors 
and teachers in 34 institutions will be 
aided during the year, 1929-30, with a 
total grant of $45,450. Of these, 
twenty-two are teachers of English, and 
twenty-one teachers of Science. Thir- 
ty-nine of these teachers have attended 
Northern Institutions, and thirty-one 
have degrees from such institutions. 

@ It is reported that Lieutenant-Co- 
lonel John E. Green, ranking colored 
officer in the regular army, is going to 
resign from the army. He was born 
in Tennessee, educated at Walden, and 
enlisted in the 24th Infantry in 1899. 

@ Cyril Clemens quotes for us a pas- 
sage from Mark ‘Twain's autobiogra- 
phy. The author is describing his bov- 
hood days on his uncle’s farm in Mis- 
souri: 

“We had a faithful and affectionate 
good friend, ally and 
‘Uncle Dan’l’, . 
were wide and warm, and whose heart 
was honest and simple, and knew no 
guile. It was on the farm that 
1 got my strong liking for his race and 


adviser in 
whose sympathies 


my appreciation of certain of its fine 
qualities. This feeling and this esti- 
mate have stood the test of sixty years 
and more, and have suffered no im 
pairment. ‘The black face is as wel 
come to me now as it was then.”

Metropolitan Life Insurance Com- 
pany, addressed the conference. 


@ The Committee of Fourteen in New 
York City has for a generation been 
engaged in the study of vice conditions 
in New York City. One of its mem- 
bers is a colored physician, Dr. Ernest 
R. Alexander. The 1928 report takes 
up the conditions of vice in Harlem. 


An investigator, working three months, 


page 418 





found in Harlem eighty-five speakeasies 
and sixty-one houses of prostitution. 
There were several instances of dives 
for perverts, criminals and the passing 
of counterfeit money. A very large 
part of these agencies were run by 
white people. 

@ Under the direction of Mrs. Alice 
Crawford, a health pageant, “The 
Queen of the Harvest”, has been pre- 
sented on the playground of the Dun- 
bar Apartments, New York City. 
There was a cast of 120 children of 
the apartments. 

@ Preliminary work on the Akeley 
African Hall has been begun in New 
York City. It is a wing of the American 
Museum of Natural History and will 
cost about $1,500,000. The building 
is a memorial to Carl Akeley, a for- 
mer member of the Museum staff, who 
collected specimens of animals in Africa 
and had them mounted to show their 
life. He died in Africa in 1926. 

@ A Third annual art exhibit of Ne- 
gro artists will be held at International

A., Detroit, and is now Executive 
Director of the Welfare Council in the 
Columbus Hill District. 


@ Mgr. John L. Belford, the rector 
of the Roman Catholic Church of the 
Nativity in Brooklyn, has written upon 
the attitude of his church toward Ne- 
groes: 

“When people intrude they deserve 
exclusion. Negroes love to make their 
way into white neighborhoods, white 
schools and white churches. One of the 
inducements offered to Southern Negroes 
to come North was the information that 
‘there a colored man can go anywhere.’ 

“When there were few, they could be 
tolerated, not only because they were 
few but because they behaved them- 
selves. When they became numerous, 
they became noisy, impudent, arrogant 
and abusive.” 


The Reverend Mr. Belford has been 
rebuked by Cardinal Hayes but ex- 
presses a well-known attitude of a 
large number of Irish Catholics. He 
“is the gentleman who once called the 
Reverend George Frazier Miller, a dis- 
tinguished Negro clergyman, “an im- 
pudent Nigger.” 
@ In Asbury 


Park, New Jersey, 
Knuckle’s Electric Shop is one of the 
outstanding businesses among colored

York City and trained in New York 
Electrician School where he was gradu- 
ated in 1920. In the busy season, from 
April to September, he employs twelve

@ Howard University received last 
year $600,000 in appropriations from 
the United States Government and 
$900,000 as gifts from friends. 

@ Emanuel M. Hewlett was born in 
1850 in New York and educated at 
the Cambridge High School, the 
Chauncey Hall School, and the Bos- 
ton University Law School. His 
father, A. M. Hewlett, was instruc- 
tor of Physical Training at Harvard 
University from 1852-72. The son 
began the practice of law in Washing- 
ton in 1880, and appeared before the 
Supreme Court of the United States 
in many important cases. In 1890, he 
was appointed by President Harrison, 
a Justice of the Peace, and was re- 
appointed by Presidents Cleveland, 
McKinley and Roosevelt, serving in 
all sixteen years. He was considered 
one of the best Justices in the District. 
He died September 19, 1929, and the 
Supreme Court of the District of Co- 
lumbia adjourned in deference to his 
memory. 


THE SOUTHEAST 


@ The Grand Lodge of the colored 
Knights of Pythias of North Carolina 
has been suspended for failure to pay 
$5,335 to the Supreme Lodge for 


emergency taxes. 


@ The official state School Facts, 
published by the Department of Pub- 
lic Instruction of North Carolina, 
shows that there was no real public 
school system in that state until Ne- 
groes got the right to vote. There 
was a “literary fund”, which by reason 
of a large gift from the United States 
Government, contributed a total of 
$2,400 for schools in 1839. In 1866, 
there was a law permitting towns and 
cities to tax themselves for public 
schools. But the law of 1869, with 
Negro suffrage, was the law that com- 
pelled public schools for at least four 
months in the year, and appropriated 
$100,000. From this beginning grew 
the school system. 

@ The Negroes of Georgia had an 
exhibit covering two thousand feet of 
floor space at the Southeastern Fair, 
Atlanta, Georgia. 

@ The Reverend Peter J. Bryant was 
born in Georgia in 1872, being his 
father’s eighth child. Mr. Bryant was 
educated in the public schools and at 
Morehouse College. He began lead- 
ing prayer meetings at the age of 
eleven and taught a public school at 
the age of fourteen. At the age of 
sixteen, he was helping his father pas- 
tor six churches. From a pastorage at 
Americus, Georgia, he was called to 
Wheat Street Baptist Church, Atlan- 
ta, Georgia in 1898, and stayed there 
for thirty years until his recent death. 
During this pastorate, he admitted 
6,000 members, married 500 couples, 
and attended 950 funerals. 


@ W. D. Manley, a white man, who 
was the head of eighty-six banks in 
Georgia and Florida, is being tried for 
fraud in the Federal Court at Atlan- 
ta. On the jury are two Negroes, 
Richard Crawford and Frank Wim- 
berley. 


@ Several years ago, Pritt Pringle in 
Jacksonville, Fla., killed the owner of 
a Negro woodyard in cold blood. He 
was sentenced to be executed. A daily 
paper began a crusade to save him and 
he was finally declared insane. Re- 
cently, in Jacksonville, a white man, 
said to be an “Honorary” Deputy 
Sheriff, shot a Negro in the back and 
killed him. He was released on $10,- 
000 bail and the Grand Jury exoner- 
ated him. 

@ W. N. Parker, Editor of the 
Menace, whose estimate of the Negro 
race we printed in the September 
Crisis, has been shot and killed in 
Jacksonville, Fla., by a white man 
whom he called a “Nigger lover.”

@ Ernest M. Taylor, manager of 
Mills restaurant, 315 Euclid Avenue, 
Cleveland, Ohio, was fined $50 and 
costs by Municipal Judge David C. 
Meck on charges of discriminating 
against Talbert White, a Negro, who 
went to the restaurant for a meal with 
three white men. Taylor was told he 
would be served only on the mezza- 
nine floor. A bus boy and not a regu- 
lar waiter was assigned to his table and 
he was assessed a service charge of 
$1.00. There is no service charge to 
patrons at any Mills restaurant. 

@ J. Wesley Jones, the new Presi- 
dent of the National Association of 
Negro Musicians, was educated at 
Walden University, Nashville, Ten- 
nessee, and at Chicago Music College. 
He is instructor of the Metropolitan 
Church Choir, which won second 
prize in the choir contest held at Or- 
chestra Hall, Chicago, 1925. Albert 
Cotsworth writes in The Music News 
of Chicago: 

Mr. Jones may be regarded as a sort 
of pioneer in bringing into the singing of 
his choir a refinement of beauty that re- 
sembles the finish and polish of the best 
musical exponent of his race—Roland 
Hayes. ‘The tone he secures has been 
hammered and pounded free from dross, 
like iron on an anvil. It is so purely 
pointed that it can flutter to but a breath 
and yet echo to the farthest reaches. It 
is so obedient that attack and exit sel- 
dom show a laggard. And it is so elastic 
that it can scale down, without break, 
that exacting demand in Dett’s “Listen 
to the Lambs”, wherein a fortissimo is 
reduced to pianissimo unbroken in qual- 
ity, more like an instrument than voice 
color.

and “disclosed a lyric soprano voice of 
beautiful timbre, perfect tonal quali- 
ties, and high range.”

@ Dr. Elmer Imes, a graduate of 
Fisk and Doctor of Philosophy of the 
University of Michigan, has been Re-

@ Mrs. Sallie W. Stewart, President 
of the National Association of Colored 
Women, had been for twenty-five years 
a teacher in the public schools of 
Evansville, Indiana. She was born in 
Tennessee but brought to Evansville 
as a child and was educated in the 
Evansville Normal School and the 
University of Chicago Junior College. 
She has served as teacher, carried on 
work as a real estate dealer and espe- 
cially been interested in social uplift 
work. She founded the Day Nursery, 
the Phillis Wheatley Home and the 
Evansville Federation of Colored 
Women, and was also for five years 
President of the Indiana Federation. 
Under her administration, twelve clubs 
bought real estate. For ten years, she 
has held various offices in the National 
Association and raised $9,000 for the 
Douglass Home. During the summer 
of 1929, she visited thirty-nine cities in 
a campaign for helping Negro children 
which is being carried on by her Asso- 
ciation. Recently she was elected a 
vice-president of the National Council 
of Women. 


@ Our readers will remember the 
story of Okolona published in October, 
1927 number of Tue Crisis.. As a 
result of continued and ruthless mur- 
der in that region in Mississippi, the 
school is to be moved, probably to 
Mound Bayou. 


TRANS MISSISSIPPI 


@ At the University of Kansas, the 
Alpha Kappa Alpha, a colored sorority, 
led all the sororities in Scholarship 
during the school year, 1928-29. 


@ William Price has recently retired 
from office as Mayor of Boley, Okla- 
homa, after a term of one year. He 
operates one of the best equipped cotton 
gins in Oklahoma. Boley is a colored 
city. ; 

@ The second art exhibit of Ne- 
groes, sponsored by the Inter-Racial- 
Committee of San Diego, Cal., has been 


held at Balboa Park. The exhibit was 
secured through the efforts of W. E. 
Scott of Chicago. There are sixty- 
eight entries, including the work of 
W. M. Farrow, J. W. Hardick, H. 
O. Tanner, Hale Woodruff, Albert 
Smith, and others. 


EAST INDIA 


@ For eleven generations in Dutch 
East India there has been developed a 
group of mulattoes of mingled Jav- 
anese and Dutch blood with some 
Portuguese blood. There are now 
about 144,000 of these mulattoes as 
compared with 60,000 of: the Dutch. 
They are of good physique and vary 
from brown to white. These “Blue 
people,” as they are called, if legiti- 
mate, have the civil status of their 
fathers and are counted white in law. 
There are thousands of them in the 
minor civil service. On the other hand, 
the possession of civil rights excludes 
them from land-holding which is con- 
fined to natives. They are conse- 
quently usually poor. They have a 
political party of about 12,000 mem- 
bers, whose president is a member of 
the Advisory Council of the Governor 
General. Inter-marriage between the 
white and mulattoes is allowed but 
discouraged. 


THE WEST INDIES 


@ The Eighth Annual Session of the 
Negro Progress Union took place in 
the Town Hall, Georgetown, British 
Guiana, in August, 1929. The Presi- 
dent is E. F. Fredericks, and the Secre- 
tary, Mrs. H. Joseph. There were 
four sessions, the main speakers being 
the President and Dr. F. G. Snelson. 
The Union has sixteen branches and 
3,000 members. 


@ The economic situation in the West 
Indies is illustrated by a strike of the 
black policemen in Granada whose de- 
mands have been partially granted. In 
the future the rookie will receive $225 
a year instead of $200 and after six 
months service, his rate of pay will be 
raised to $260 a year! 


@ The Supreme Court at Kingston, 
Jamaica, was crowded September 26 to 
hear the case of Marcus Garvey and 
Lewis Ashenheim, to show cause why 
they should not be committed for con- 
tempt of court. The action grew out 
of a speech delivered September 9th. 
Mr. Garvey undertook his own de- 
fense and declared his desire “to fully 
apologize to this court for the words 
I have used.” The Chief Justice in 
delivering sentence September 27th 
said: 

In assessing the penalty it is impossible 
to ignore the fact that Garvey is not a 
well-meaning man guilty of an offence 
simply owing to his impulsiveness or 
folly. The Judicial Committee mention 


* 419 













































































































































































































































































that he was imprisoned for using the 
United States mail for obtaining money 
by false pretenses from the members of 
the Negro race. 


Then Garvey on the 5th of August 
last told one of us, when answering for 
an earlier contempt, that he had been de- 
ported from the United States in 1927 or 
1928. The contempt referred to was 
committed on the 30th of July, and 
Garvey was lightly fined and severely 
admonished in respect of it. In the cir- 
cumstances he will be imprisoned for 
three calendar months and ordered to 
pay a fine of £100, or be further im- 
prisoned for three calendar months un- 
less the fine be sooner paid. This sen- 
tence takes much account of the fact 
that Garvey is a hot headed and foolish 
man. At first it seemed to us that he 
ought to be sent to prison for six months 
at least without the option of a fine. But, 
mainly for the reason assigned, we have 
now given him the opportunity of escap- 
ing half that sentence. We don’t forget 
that the retraction on his part may allay 
feelings which it was his apparent policy 
to arouse, and thus render severity once 
contemplated unessential. 

While in prison, Garvey was elected a 
member of the Corporation of the city 
of Kingston. The Corporation corres 
ponds to our Board of Aldermen.

EAST AFRICA 


@ In September, the first Ethiopian 
airplane, the “Tafari Eagle’, flew 
from the coast to the capital of Abys- 
sinia. The King and the two young 
princes received the aviators in state. 
His Majesty said: 

“Ethiopia, as all know, had a great 
civilization before the days of Christ, 
having political and commercial relations 
with Palestine, Arabia, and India, and in 
later ages with Portugal, Spain, and 
other countries. And since 1884, it has 
resumed its ancient rank and power, and 
we, and those who follow us, must labor 
to ensure that it keeps the onward path.” 
@ Archaeologists have discovered in 
East Africa evidences of new types of 
ancient African people and the buried 
city of Gedi. The town is four or five 
miles in circumference and was built 
probably in the 13th Century. 

« @ The Report of Sir Samuel Wilson 
on closer union of the colonies in Brit- 
ish East Africa has been published by 
the British Government. It provides 
for a weak central government and 
practically ignores the question of the 
natives. 


WEST AFRICA 


@ E. S. Beoku-Betts, and Dr. H. 
Bankole Bright, are candidates for 
elective membership in the Legislative 
Council of Sierra Leone. They are 
contending for wider opportunities for

West African lawyers and doctors and 
for the restoration of jury trial. 


@ Mr. Kouyate of French West 
Africa declared at the last Congress 
Against Imperialism held in Frank- 
fort, Germany, that the population of 
the French Congo was being extermi- 
nated by forced labor on railroads and 
transport and by sleeping sickness. It 
has decreased from 9,000,000 in 1900 
to 2,850,000 in 1921. This country 
has been under the control of conces- 
sion companies for thirty years. One 
of these companies, the Batignolles 
Building Company, built a railway line 
of 114 kilometers, working their men 
eleven and twelve hours a day without 
modern tools. It is said that this line 
cost of lives of twenty-five thousand 
Negroes. 


@ French Equatorial Africa provided 
for 23,250 conscripted workers in 
1929 at a monthly wage of from 35 to 
50 francs. When conscription was 
adopted in November, 1928, the Bayas 
in Upper Sangha rebelled. Many Ne- 
groes were hanged and villages burned 
and some 200,000 escaped to neighbor- 
ing colonies. Many of the Negroes 
were physically mutilated as a punish- 
ment, 


SOUTH AFRICA 


@ A conference of the South African 
Federation of Non-European Trade 
Unions has been held at Johannesburg. 
Eleven unions were represented. They 
demand equal pay for equal work; a 
forty-eight-hour week, and organiza- 
tion. The Secretary of the white 
Trade Union Congress was present. 

@ Miss Caton-Thompson, an English 





Miss Washington, a Doctor of Philosophy, 
Ohio State University 





scientist, lecturing in South Africa, 
says: 

“Tt is inconceivable to me how the 
theory of a Semitic or civilized origin 
for the Zimbabwe ruins came to be held. 
Instead of a degenerate offshoot of a 
higher Oriental civilization, you seem to 
have a vigorous native civilization, show- 
ing national organization, originality, 
and surprising industry. One can _ posi- 
tively affirm that the material culture of 
these people is typically Bantu—from the 
earliest deposits to the latest.’’ 


@ Mr. Onellas, a Portuguese mem- 
ber of the Governing Council of 
Mozambique, has declared that in the 
last thirty years more than 200,000 
black Portuguese laborers taken to the 
mines of the Transvaal, have died 
from disease. He declared that the 
colony lived in ostentation at the cost 
of the life and money of the natives 
who went to the mines. 


@ Pre-historic rock paintings have 
been discovered in the Marandellas 
district of Rhodesia by Professor Cip- 
riani of the University of Florence. 
They were probably done by Bushman. 
Professor Cipriani has also examined 
the famous Zimbabwe ruins and thinks 
that they were the work of Negroes. 


@ High Mass, with a congregation 
consisting of Europeans and thousands 
of Africans, has been celebrated in 
Uganda at the Cathedral of Rubaja. 
The papal delegate Bishop Hinsley, 
8 Bishops and a number of native 
priests assisted. ‘There are three hun- 
dred thousand Negro Catholics in 
Uganda. 


@ New buildings for the accommoda- 
tion of 300 more students with recrea- 
tion rooms are to be erected at the 
South African Native College, Fort 
Hare. These buildings are the gifts 
of the Y. M. C. A. in the United 


States and Canada. 


@ Over sixty Negroes from South 
Africa have taken degrees during the 
last twenty years from colleges outside 
the country and the South African Na- 
tive College, Fort Hare, has had ten 
graduates given degrees by the Uni- 
versity of South Africa. 


@ There are seven Negro physicians 
in South Africa for a population of six 
million Bantu. 


@ The London Daily Mail suggests 
a vast new British Protectorate in 
Africa through the Union of Kenya, 
Uganda, and Tanganyika under one 
Governor General. The new coun- 
try would be seven times the size of 
Great Britain, with a population of 
something over ten million Negroes 
and less than eighteen thousand Euro- 
peans, who propose to exercise all 
political control.

CRISIS: 








~YOUTHPORT 








For Juniors of the N. A. A. C. P. 








This Young Negro 
By WALKER H. JORDAN 
: young Negro seems to be 


coming in for an unusual amount 
of discussion. And while there van be 
no doubt as to the need for some of 
this discussion, it is nevertheless a fact 
that much of this discussion has re- 
solved itself into no more than ad- 
verse fault-finding, rather than into 
constructive criticism aiming at the 
betterment of the deplorable condition 
cecasioning this hysteria of condemna- 
tion. It must be that much of this mis- 
directed effort has its origin in the at- 
tempt to see this young Negro as an 
entity, apart from the great army of 
young the world over, and to dissociate 
and treat his weaknesses apart from the 
common foibles of the age. But a 
closer inspection would reveal the 
rather pertinent fact that the young 
Negro is in no wise different from the 
young Russian, Turk, or Chinese. All 
are products of this civilization, and 
not by any means a finished product at 
that. And the young Negro, perhaps 
more than any of the others, is having 
this civilization literally thrust upon 
him. His excesses, concerning which 
so much has been written, might have 
easily been predicted by the thoughtful. 
For every student of history knows, or 
rather should know, that one of the 
very first signs of a group’s change in 
status, civil, economic, religious, po- 
litical, or social, is the excess to which 
that advancing group goes. 

The young in Russia, in China, in 
Turkey; the gross extravaganza of 
wealth of the American Red man, sud- 
denly become rich on oil; the ludicrous 
exhibition which the Anglo-Saxon 
nouveau riche makes of itself in the 
leading hotels, are all analogous to the 
extravagances of our Negro youth. The 
gesture differs in quantity, not in kind, 
with the Negro youth on the short end. 
And for all there is the same hope for 
solution: Time. For in spite of all 
that we have done, Humanity remains 
just about the same, and hitherto has 
managed to right itself and to forge 
ahead. The human race has man- 
aged to survive most things, and funda- 
mentally has clung tenaciously to most 
of its earliest instincts. No matter how

EFrFri£ LEE Maweneds: Critic 





The portraits on this and the next paye 
represent the Class of 1929, Tuskegee In- 
stitute 


carefully we smear over the veneer of 
civilization, and gloss it to shine in 
our own eyes, scratch that veneer ever 
so slightly, and the cave man snarls 
through, and we kill and mangle just 
as our fore-sires did a million years ago. 
We are still children ready and anxious 
at all times to “show off”; still fond 
of new toys, whether of money, politics 
or social privilege, gloating over our 
privilege to play with it, even though 
it be temporarily to our detriment. But 
if ever we are to master and use this 
new toy, playing with it, even though 
it be dangerous, cannot be an entirely 
bad prerequisite. 


All those people who are inclined 
to throw up their hands in a gesture of 
despair, and to exclaim, upon beholding 
the excesses of this generation: ‘‘What 
is the youth of today coming to!” 
should reserve both their criticism and 
their despair for yet a few years. For 
the worst is not yet come. In just a 
few years, as time goes, there will not 
be living a single boy or girl who can 
remember a grandmother who wore 
long skirts, bustles, mutton leg sleeves, 
and petticoats, and who did not smoke, 
drink synthetic gin, and dance the 
Charleston. And yet, biologically 
there will be but little difference. 
Blood doesn’t change over night. When 
we grow alarmed at the restlessness of 
this generation, at the stirring revolt 
against restraint, we should not forget 
that in the veins of this youth flows 
much of the blood of the buccaneers, 
the pioneers, the builders of the early 
empires as well as the no less daring, 
but different strains of the Jesuits and 
early Church Fathers. 


A couple of decades ago this restless- 
ness and flamboyancy of youth began 
to make itself felt, but when the as- 
sassin’s pistol lighted the funeral pyre 
of Civilization that same irrepressible, 
“irresponsible” youth stepped from the 
pleasure car into the armored truck; 
exchanged the uke for the bayonet, 
drew the khaki shirts over the slit one 
and went down into No Man’s Land 
and there died gloriously that some 
others of the stay-at-home, fault-find- 
ing, criticising kind might have a de- 
cent place in which to live. Among the 
very best there will always be a shining 
place for the so-called lounge lizzards, 
lovers and pimps which made up the 


421 


illustrious 15th; the so-called hoodlums 
which composed the first separate Bat- 
talion; the so-called riff-raff around 
which the old 8th was mustered; nor 
are we forgetting those “free citizens” 
who lived in the Parisian underworld, 


they whose fierce attack, perhaps more 
than all the others, swept back the 
enemy from the very gates of Paris. 
Those countless graves in Flanders 


422 


Field hold the whitening bones of the 
world’s daring youth,—those mad, 
wild youngsters to whom restraint was 
a kind of fetter stifling the best that 
was in them! So that it would seem 
that reckless daring and excesses are 
not only human _ characteristics, 
thoroughly definable, but as well a cer- 
tain well set up phase through which 
at some stage of the game, all advanc- 
ing groups must pass. The Young 
Negro could scarcely expect to be an 
exception, even if he so wished. 

Let him rave, then; let him paint 
his autos red; let him squander his 
money on frat dances for yet a little 
while. In the end he will right him- 
self; and too, it is the only real way in 
which he will ever really learn that 
money squandered on frat dances will 
not buy homes. It will take the bitter 
experience of being set out of a rented 
house onto the curb to teach him that 
lesson so as to be of the greatest value 
to him and to his group. And the 
sooner he gets that lesson tucked away 
in his head, the better for us all. No 
one ever yet found anything which 
could take the place of experience. 


Until someone does, Races like men, 
must experiment. And always it is 
the experimenter who wins through. 
Life gives up its sweetest secrets to the 
daring investigator only. There is no 
substitute for living. There is noth- 
ing like getting down into the welter 
of life, and there doing battle with the 
worst that life has to offer for the best 
that there is to gain. David wrote his 
Psalms after his excesses; he sang glo- 
riously about having his feet taken 
from the mire and the clay, but that 
was after life had knocked him down, 
—after the packard, raccoon coat 
stage. His contemporaries, timid souls 
that they were, contributed no such 
masterpieces of warning and inspira- 
tion to the literature of the world; got 
no such fun out of life. The youth of 
that day went down into the den and 
slew the lion, and the Negro of today 
will do the same. One can’t tell a 
man nor a race into success; it must 
hammer its way into a place in the 
sun, and it were infinitely the better 
prepared for the struggle after it has 
barked its toes on the ugly shins of 
Impossibility.

CRISIS 


BENTLEY 


HERE are many ways in which 

Americans of Negro descent face 
the problem of their situation in Ameri- 
ca. Some become sullen, bitter and in- 
active; some become cynical and care- 
less. Between these two extremes 
stand two sets of men: the larger group 
tacitly accept segregation, and go to 
work to build a black world and as 
complete and as good a one as is prac- 
tical. They become “colored” lawyers, 
“colored” editors, ‘“‘colored’’ business 
men, and “‘colored”’ dentists. 

There is a smaller group who refuse 
to label themselves by any distinction, 
particularly one that implicitly seems to 
grant to race or color any importance 
as a matter of human distinction. These 
men fight the color line by ignoring it 
just as far as possible, and doing their 
work as men. Such a man was Charles 
Edward Bentley, who is today dead in 
Chicago. As a young man, he traveled 
as a concert singer; then he studied 
dentistry, and opened offices in Chicago. 
He became one of the best and most 
widely known of Chicago dentists of 
any race. He counted in his clientele 
some of the greatest men in the Middle 
West. 

He was not contented to be simply 
a dentist, but with a fine and broad 
conception of the social importance of 
his profession, he took a leading part 
in the Chicago Dental Association, be- 
coming at one time its President; he 
was a leader in establishing dental 
clinics in the public schools of America; 
he was selected head of the clinics at

A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND COURAGE FROM ACROSS 
THE SEA 


HE injustice done to the coloured race within its gates is well exempli- 
fied in the noise which has been made by Mrs. Hoover’s womanly 
act in making no difference in her invitations to the wives of the United 


States Congressmen. 


‘“‘All men are born equal and free’ does not seem to embrace the 
coloured population when it comes to social equality, so those who declare 
this had better alter it to a more honest phraseology and say: “All (white) 
men are born equal and free,” for that is what they surely mean. 

We do not enjoy, in the fullest sense, liberty for ourselves if we can 


tolerate a state of subjection in others. 


Just as the man who can remain 


unmoved by the spectacle of cruelty inflicted on others is himself liable 
to be merciless, so the man or woman who wishes to see a race kept in a 


servile condition will be likely to be tyrannical and overbearing. 


But I 


would like to urge all coloured people to remember that it is not the colour 
of the skin which matters but what any people say and do. 

The uplift of your race is in your hands and with such a leader as 
Burghardt Du Bois you are bound to go far. 

The words of Florence Mills, cut off in her young womanhood, can 
be an inspiration for all to call their own; “I live for the betterment of 


my race.” 
“Press right-on, 
equality.

the St. Louis Exposition, and the first 
breaking of his health came in the mag- 
nificent meeting of the American Den- 
tal Association, which he as Chairman 
of the Committee of Arrangements, 
brought together in Chicago. 

Such a career as his entails sacrifice, 
hard work, personal insult and criti- 
cism. Continually, he had to brace 
himself against the petty insults which 
white Americans so often throw in the 
face of a man in his position. But 
even more difficult, was the criticism of 
his own race. The assumption which 
Negroes continually make is that if a 
man works as an American, rather than 
as a Negro, he is ashamed of his Negro 
blood. And yet, Dr. Bentley, showed 
in endless ways his deep passion for the 
uplift of the Negro. He was one of 
the original members of the Niagara 
Movement, that first bitter protest 
against the program of surrender and 
segregation. He was from its incorpo- 
ration until his death, a member of 
the Board of Directors of the N. A. A. 
C. P., and no cause that involved eman- 
cipation of the Negro failed of his en- 
thusiastic support, so long as it did not 
involve any surrender of human rights. 


In memory of her, I as a white Irish woman, beg of you to 
having faith in your ultimate goal of freedom and

race will look upon men like Charles 
Edward Bentley as their real emanci- 
pators. 


PAN-AFRICA 


AST summer, the French Travel 

Agency, a semi-official organiza- 
tion in close relation with the French 
Government, approached me with the 
proposal to arrange an excursion of 
educated and well-to-do colored people 
to Europe. I was interested and im- 
mediately suggested that this excursion 
might include North Africa and a Fifth 
Pan-African Congress. They were en- 
thusiastic, and with my consent, sent 
out several hundred invitations over my 
name, to such addresses as we could 
secure. 


Many persons expressed their inter- 
est, but there were difficulties: In the 
first place, in order to visit Africa, and 
in order to see France in normal times, 
and meet the better class of people, and 
also in order to get reasonable rates and 
a ship of our own, the excursion must 
take place in winter. This excluded 
the teachers and many of the profes- 
sional and business men. Nevertheless, 


423 





nearly fifty persons thought that they 
might be able to go, and the Fifth Pan- 
frican Congress was announced to be 
held at Tunis at Christmas time. 
When, however, the time for final ar- 
rangements came, it was found that 
there were not nearly enough persons 
who were willing and able to make the 
trip. With regret and disappointment, 
therefore, the trip has been abandoned 
and the Fifth Pan-African Congress in- 
definitely postponed. 

Back of all this, lies the fact that 
the importance of these meetings is not 
yet realized by educated and thinking 
Negroes. We are not yet Pan-African- 
minded. We do not realize the com- 
mon interests of black folk the world 
over, and the number of worthwhile 
Negroes who exist outside the United 
States. Moreover, a great many per- 
sons have had their interest dampened 
by the unfortunate career and words 
of Marcus Garvey. Nevertheless, the 
idea back of the Pan-African Congress 
is sound and important, and in less than 
a hundred years, it is going to be real- 
ized. 


HISTORY 


HERE have been two great cele- 

brations in the United States. 
‘The most beautiful and satisfying has 
been the tribute paid to Thomas Edi- 
son. We do not usually do this sort 
of thing well in America. We are 
either flamboyant and strident, or curi- 
ously forgetful; but the honor done 
Edison through Henry Ford was deli- 
cate and appropriate, and we can only 
regret that one figure was absent. 
Lewis Howard Latimer, who died De- 
cember 11, 1928, was an Edison 
Pioneer. In a Report of the Pioneers, 
the following was recently written: 


“It was Mr. Latimer who executed 
the drawings and assisted in preparing 
the applications for the telephone patents 
of Alexander Graham Bell. In 1880, he 
entered the employ of Hiram S. Maxim, 
electrician of the United States Electric 
Lighting Company, then located at 
Bridgeport, Connecticut. It was while in 
this employ that Mr. Latimer success- 
fully produced a method of making car- 
bon filaments for the Maxim electric in- 
candescent lamp, which he patented. His 
keen perception of the possibilities of the 
electric light and kindred industries re- 
sulted in his being the author of several 
other inventions. He assisted in install- 
ing and placing in operation some of the 
first ‘Maxim’ incandescent electric light 
plants in New York City, Philadelphia 
and Canada, for the United States Elec- 
tric Light Company, and supervised the 
production of the carbon filaments em- 
ployed therein, such as the Equitable 
Building, Fiske & Hatch, Caswell & 
Massey’s, and the Union League Club 
of New York City, as well as the offices 
of the Philadelphia Ledger in Philadel- 
phia. In the Autumn of 1881, Mr. 
Latimer was sent to London, England, 
to establish an incandescent lamp depart- 


424 


ment for the Maxim-Weston Electric 
Light Company. In 1882-3, he was em- 
ployed by the Olmstead Electric Light- 
ing Company of Brooklyn, New York, 
and then by the Acme Electric Light 
Company of New York City. 

“In 1884, he became associated with 
the Engineering Department of the Edi- 
son Electric Light Company at 65 Fifth 
Avenue, New York City, but in 1890 
was transferred to the Legal Depart- 
ment where he remained until the forma- 
tion of the Board of Patent Control in 
1896 by the General Electric and West- 
inghouse Companies, becoming its chief 
draughtsman, a position he held until the 
abolition of this Board in 1911, when he 
became associated with Edwin W. Ham- 
mer, Patent Solicitor, and Engineer of 
New York City, and later with the firm 
of Hammer and Schwarz. Mr. Lati- 
mer’s activities were brought to an un- 
fortunate conclusion in the early part of 
1924 by infirmities that finally caused his 
demise. 

“He was of the colored race, the only 
one in our organization, and was one of 
those to respond to the initial call that led 
to the formation of the Edison Pioneers, 
January 24th, 1918. Broadmindedness, 
versatility in the accomplishment of 
things intellectual and cultural, a lin- 
guist, a devoted husband and father, all 
were characteristic of him, and his gen- 
ial presence will be missed from our 
gatherings.” 


The other celebration, was that of 
the siege of Savannah, which took place 
150 years ago. Much has been said of 
the Polish Count Casimir Pulaski, who 
was killed in this fighting, and of the 
French, English and Americans who 
helped. But not a word has been said 
of the black Haitians, and yet they 
were there. 

“As the army began its retreat, Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Maitland with the gren- 
adiers, and marines who were _incor- 
porated with the grenadiers, charged its 
rear with the purpose of accomplishing 
its annihilation. It was then that there 
occurred the most brilliant feat of the 
day, and one of the bravest ever per- 
formed by foreign troops in the Ameri- 
can cause. In the army of D’Estaing was 
a legion of black and mulatto freedmen, 
known as Fontages Legion, commanded 
by Viscount de Fontages, a brave and 
experienced officer. The strength of this 
legion is given variously from: six hun- 
dred to over eight hundred men. This 
legion met the fierce charge of Maitland 
and saved the retreating army.” 

In the official French record of this 
battle, it is repeated: 


“This legion saved the army at Sa- 
vannah by bravery covering its retreat. 
Among the blacks who rendered signal 
services at that time were: Andre, Beau- 
vais, Rigaud, Villatte, Beauregard, Lam- 
bert, who latterly became generals un- 
der the convention, including Henri 
Christophe, the future king of Haiti.” 


This is the same Christophe who is 
the hero of Vandercook’s “Black 
Majesty”. How singular it is that not 
a single American had the grace to re- 


member these black Haitians who died 
fighting for American liberty and who 
after they had secured their own free- 
dom and kept it more than a century 
were wantonly deprived of it by that 
same America! 
CARVER 

6s@ OQMEDAY when THE Crisis 

is treating of Negro leaders | 
should like to see another comprehen- 
sive sketch on Dr. George W. Carver 
appear. He is doubtless a warm friend 
of yours. He is the first Negro I re- 
member. He was completing his un- 
dergraduate work at Iowa State Col- 
lege at Ames, Iowa, when my father 
went there as president in 1891. I was 
only porridge-eating size then, but | 
have a distinct remembrance of him 
working among the flowers around the 
dilapidated old horticultural building 
(long since replaced). ‘That must have 
been several years later, probably when 
he was an instructor in the botany de- 
partment. His old chief in that de- 
partment, Dr. L. H. Pammel, resigned 
only the other day after many years’ 
service. 

“Dr. Carver irritates me enormously 
at times when he wholly discounts his 
own abilities and gives all credit for his 
amazing chemistry discoveries to a 
‘Divine Guide’, a ‘Divine Fire’ and the 
like. All genius, I suppose, has the 
backing of the Angels of the Lord, but 
certainly his forty years of patient 
study cannot be dismissed so lightly and 
rudely. For all that, he remains a 
wizard who receives my unbounded ad- 
miration. It depresses me when I en- 
counter many supposedly educated Ne- 
groes who do not seem to have heard of 
him. He keeps his light too well hid- 
den under a bushel. You may agree 
with me that the average Negro pays 
little attention to the real achievements 
of his race outside of politics and sports 
—though perhaps, to be entirely fair, I 
should say ‘too little attention.’ ” 


ADULT EDUCATION 


N a number of the larger cities 
great emphasis is being laid today 


upon adult education. There are or- 
ganizations “active in furthering this 
movement. ‘They are interested in se- 
curing lecturers who will, for a nom- 
inal sum, address groups of men and 
women interested in current social af- 
fairs. They are also reaching down 
into the youth groups and trying to 
steer them away from useless chatter 
into purposeful channels. 

I believe that every branch of the 
N. A. A. C. P. should get in touch 
with the organization in its own com- 
munity furthering this adult education 
movement. It should arrange to pro- 
vide competent Negro lecturers upon

Exploitation or Co-operation 
(Continued from page 406) 


New chain systems are constantly 
being established and existing organi- 
zations are multiplying the number of 
retail units under their control. Sales 
are increasing rapidly and new lines of 
trade are being invaded by chain or- 
ganizations. “There is but little doubt 
that chains will continue to grow in 
relative importance for some time to 
come”’.??,. When the white proprietor 
is driven out of business by the chain 
store he goes to work for the chain 
store or for some other chain; the Ne- 
gro merchant usually need not apply. 

“To ask an individual colored man 
to go into the grocery business or to 
open a drygoods shop or to sell meat, 
shoes, candy, books, cigars, clothes or 
fruit in competition with the chain 
store, is to ask him to commit slow but 
almost inevitable economic suicide, un- 
less he has some unusual local or per- 
sonal advantage’.’* It is estimated 
that 50 per cent of the total chain re- 
tail units are operated by grocery 
chains and that drugs, shoes, tobacco 
and five and ten cent store organiza- 
tions operate 20 per cent to 25 per 
cent of the total number of chain re- 
tail outlets.** 

Thus chain stores in four fields, i. e., 
groceries, drugs, shoes, and tobacco, 
constitute nearly three-fourths of all 
chain stores in the United States. 


Agriculture 


N agriculture, a quarter of a cen- 
| tury’s training has not enabled the 
Negro to hold his own in this field. 
According to the census of 1920, Ne- 
gro farm owners decreased from 218,- 


972 in 1910 to 218,612 in 1920. Cash 


tenants decreased from 285,950 in 
1910 to 193,102 in 1920. In short, 
Negro agricultural schools did not and 
do not hold the key to the agricultural 
problems. 


So much for the disease. Now for 
the remedy. In the January Crisis, 
Mr. Matney will tell what his remedy 
« for the economic ills of the Negro is.

older brother, who is a physician in 
Kansas City, moved him to decide to 
work his way through the University. 
For four years, aside from a little help 
from his father, he paid his expenses by 
working in a garage, cooking in private 
families, and doing janitor work. 

After completing his course, he de- 
voted three years to organization and 
social work among the Negroes of New 
Mexico, Missouri, Illinois, and Ohio. 
For this service he received no salary, 
but earned his living by working in 
garages.

grades have been very good; and I 
have found him possessed of a clear and 
discriminating mind.” 


Since he was the only colored man in 
his class, his selection as Chief Justice 
of one of the freshman moot courts in 
his senior year signifies the high esteem 
in which he is held by his fellows as 
well as their broadmindedness in the 
choice of the one they deemed best 
fitted for this honorary position. He 
was elected a member of the board of 
governors of seven, w hich organization 
has charge of all the extra curricular 
activities of the law students. 

During his residence in Berkeley he 
has received many invitations to give 
addresses from white and _ colored 
churches, clubs, and classes. He has 
had a leading part in the activities of 
the Brotherhood of Races, which is the 
University’s melting pot. 

A few nights ago he delivered a lec- 
ture on “The Educator’s Responsibility 
for the American Race Problem” at 
Stanford University at the banquet of 
the Phi Delta Kappa Fraternity, the 
honorary society of the University’s 
faculty of the College of Education. 
The address was followed by hearty 
applause from a group that is not given 
to spilling unscheduled enthusiasm. He 
was one of the leaders of the last meet- 
ing of the Students’ Institute of Pacific 
Relations at Los Gatos and is chair- 
man of the executive committee of that 
society at present. 

On July 31st and August 1-2, the 
State Bar Association examined five 
hundred applicants for admission, 
among whom were Mr. Johnson and 
four other Negroes. Forty-eight per 
cent of this number failed. Mr. John- 
son was among those who made the 
grade. 


Another event, which indicates his 
academic standing in his Alma Mater, 
was the recent action of the Law De- 
partment of the University in award- 
ing to him the Sheffield Sanborn Schol- 
arship which will enable him to devote 
this year to study and research work in 
jurisprudence and will give him special 
qualification to serve on some federal 
or state commission. He is the first 
Negro to win a scholarship in the law 
department.

expect better returns from their money than a mere four per cent interest rate. 


Concurrent with the enormous increase of property holders in this city has arisen the de- 
mand for adequate FUEL distribution. Obviously, an investment in commodities that are 
absolutely essential to modern civilized life has all the earmarks of soundness, while the 
fact that the enterprise itself is destined to expand simultaneously with the social advance-

Grim and determined, she is still work-

young men and opened for business Oc- 
tober 20, with a paid-in capital of 
$25,000 and total resources of $70,000, 
at the end of the first year. The bank 
found itself in difficulties in 1922, and 
the officers of the Southern Aid Society 
of Virginia came to its rescue. Mr. 
James ‘I’. Carter became President, B. 
L. Jordan, Vice President, and B. T. 
Kennay, Secretary-Treasurer. At the 
close of business December 31, 1928, 
the bank had $100,000 of paid-in capi- 


tal, a surplus of $11,000, and deposits 
of $351,592. 


This is the organization which will 
occupy the former banking quarters of 
Mechanics Bank. The location of the 
bank is only two blocks from Broad 
Street, whith is one of the _ busiest 
streets in the South. At 3rd and Broad 
is going up a twenty-three-story bank 
building by one of the leading National 
banks of the South. Negro business, 
therefore, is beginning again in Rich- 
mond at an important point. The 
Southern Aid Insurance Society will oc- 
cupy at least two floors of the building 
and the other floors will be let to the 
leading colored professional and busi- 
ness men. ‘The Commercial Bank and 
Trust Company is the youngest of the 
three Negro banks in Richmond, one of 
the others being St. Lukes, under the 
well-known Mrs. Maggie Walker.

statement signed by some fifty of them 
denouncing color prejudice in the 
church, confessing guilt of this attitude 
and practice and calling upon the 
church for revision of its manner of 
dealing with the issue. 


One other thing has again been made 
abundantly clear for anyone who can 
read. That is, that Negroes in Amer- 
ica have at their service an engine for 
the presentation of their point of view 
to the American public, second to none 
in the country. What really con-

LOSSES 


We always hear a 
lot about profits 
that are made on 
the stock market 
but seldom do we 
hear about the 
losses. Only when 
there is a bad mar- 
ket such as has 
just passed do we 
hear _ anything 
publicly about the 
losses suffered by 
many investors. 


Most of these people 
are speculating. They 
refuse to accept the 
sound advice of their 
bankers. If they 
bought under their 
guidance they could 
sit back and not wor- 
ry about the rise and 
fall of the Exchange. 


Protection in

most important ways 
in which we can serve

a way that it is really an appeal for

R. MORDECAI W. JOHN- 

SON, President of Howard Uni- 
versity, calls our attention to the fact 
that his speech on “The Work of the 
N. A. A. C. P” published in the Octo- 
ber Crisis had not received the author’s 
final corrections and consequently con- 
tained a number of errors and infelici- 
ties. We are sorry the mistake oc- 
curred. 


Postscript 
(Continued from page 424) 


the race problem who are willing to 
address white or mixed groups. If these 
lecturers are not obtainable in the local 
community, branch officers should com- 
municate with the New York office 
for assistance. 

Much of the philosophy underlying 
the present adult education movement 
is hazy. The chief exponents of this 
recent social manifestation talk end- 
lessly, beginning nowhere and ending 
in the same place. But they are sin- 
cerely desirous of accomplishing some- 
thing, and they usually have the funds 
needed for constructive work. 

Branches of the N. A. A. C. P. 
ought to take the initiative in educat- 
ing the white race upon the Negro and 
his problems. I believe it would pay 
to seek the co-operation of these adult 
education groups through their central 
organizations. At the same time I 
believe it is advisable for branches 
to act upon their own initiative and 
see if arrangements cannot be made 
with schools, church organizations, lit- 
erary clubs and other societies created 
for a more or less serious purpose to 
secure the presentation of the Negro’s 
specific problems from the latter’s point 
of view. 

I feel that N. A. A. C. P. branches 
are numerous enough and experienced 
enough to be something more than de- 
fense bodies. Many branches are prac- 
tically asleep except when a particu- 
larly flagrant case of discrimination 
arouses them to a brief period of ac- 
tivity. 

If each branch would dedicate itself 
to a campaign of interracial education, 
it would have something to occupy it- 
self in a constructive way from Sep- 
tember to June.

Round Table Talks—Twentieth Year Program 


In November, 1910, the CRISIS began. 
we start the 20th year which we hope to finish with a 
larger circulation and a bigger and better magazine. This 
will be possible only through the co-operation of writers, 
advertisers, agents, subscribers and buyers of single copies. 


LLOW me to thank you for print- 
ing the facts about Rabindranath 
Tagore’s treatment on the Pacific 
Coast. I had an intimation of this 
from something I saw, but it was very 
unsatisfactory and incomplete. The 
facts, I think, ought to be more general- 
ly known. If they had treated a coal 
heaver this way no harm would have 
been done, for a coal heaver is accus- 
tomed to that kind of treatment; but 
to treat as wonderful a soul as Tagore 
was treated in San Francisco shows a 
lack of manners, for which our entire 
government should be ashamed 
Dr. Tagore’s message is a wonderful 
one and I hope that you will find oc- 
casion to insert it, as well as that of 
Mahatma Gandhi, in frequent num- 
bers of THE Crisis. 
Bolton Smith, Memphis, Tenn. 


I have not the time to write you as 
I would write on several matters which 
my now belated reading of the July 
CRISIS impress upon me; but I now 
express to you my thought that your 
“Government by Graft” is one of the 
most effective brief statements of the 
case which I have read. 

I always find your opening summary 
unique in its power as well as grasp of 
situations. It makes me mourn again 
and again, as I said to you in my house 
here ten years ago, that you did not 
use qualities so notable for constructive 
pulling together rather than for the dis- 
integrating criticisms you write over 
and again of Hampton and Tuskegee. 


The recent incident of Mr. Abbott’s 
London hotel experiences makes it clear 
that the richness of the artistic endow- 
ments of the African can not be driven 
into the minds or hearts of the absurd- 
ly egotistic Nordics, but must be car- 
ried into the consciousness of minds 
opened by the practice of the extraordi- 
nary qualities of Patience and Gentle- 
ness which the greatest of the Prophets 
has shown to be more powerful than 
any Marxian types of antagonists. 


The Verse page is fine, I think. And 
in fact, the whole July number has 
too much richness of material to allow 
one to be merely passive in regretful 
thought that so many minds are kept 
from even reading one of the most bril- 
liant of current periodicals. 


George Foster Peabody, Saratoga. 


Permit me to congratulate you upon 
the distinctive improvement in THE 
Crisis. It is the one magazine for 
which I “crave” each month, and im- 
mediately upon its receipt, I read it in 
its entirety. 

G. D. Brantley, Missouri. 


I want to compliment the mechanics, 
art work, etc., in reproducing Mrs, De 
Priest’s picture in a recent issue of THE 
Crisis. It was particularly fine—that 
was the general comment. 

Morris Lewis, Secretary 
to Congressman DePriest.

With this issue 


Each month I look forward to and 
read THe Crisis with a great deal of 
pleasure. But being a mere woman 
there is an article in the November is- 
sue that appeals to me particularly. 

I refer to “I am not Invited”. I 
think every woman should read and 
profit by it and so I am going to repro- 
duce it—of course, giving credit to 
‘THE Crists—on the Woman’s Page 
of the It is a whole 
sermon to women in a brief article. 


Allow me to thank you for “The 
Stroud Family” in July, and for “Clif- 
ford Blount” in August. This is the 
kind of stuff that I have longed to see 
in THE Crisis. Cannot tell you how 
these articles pepped me up, and there 
are many others who were helped 
thereby, I am sure. 


Sam B. Wallace, South Carolina. 


Just a line to express my apprecia- 
tion, as a reader of your valuable maga- 
zines, of the very great service THE 
Crisis is doing for our people along 


all lines. Just now I am attracted by 
your comprehensive reply to the young 
man who has chosen Journalism as a 
profession. 

Sam Williams, Massachusetts. 


Please note my new address as given 
above and send the magazine to me at 
my college address. My old address is 
given below. 

I am another white student who en- 
joys reading your magazine.
