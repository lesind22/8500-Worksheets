HE bell has struck. 
clared for independence; China 


is determined to try all residents in 
China in her own courts; Egypt has 
elected a Parliament of Nationalists, 
and Ethiopia has sent a Minister to 
England. The myth of the divine 
overlordship of Europe over the col- 
ored world is beginning to fade.-—The 
civilized world is sitting in Europe and 
trying to decide how many engines of 
murder every nation needs on the high 
seas in order to be safe from its fellow 
Christians.—S pain is again considering 
how soon it can be ruled according to 
law and not according to the will of 
Primo de Rivera——We have appealed 
to Russia to do a deed of charity and 
kindness. Imagine the remarks and 
advice and warning that would have 
followed any appeal by Russia to us. 
—What with Protons, Electrons, and 
Photons waving their way through the 
world, this problem of solid matter 
has become much more intricate and 
diffcult of understanding than our old 
friend, the Soul—We are running

and Eastern thirst. The result is war 
and murder.—When we take revenge 
and hate and cruelty out of our whole 
penal system, we shall begin to get 
somewhere. Human punishment is 
not merely a matter of brick walls.— 
The real trouble in dustria is housing. 
Public funds have been spent for the 
housing of poor people. Whoever 
heard of such a thing? Usually, pub- 
lic money is spent for the rich: boule- 
vards, mustn’t touch parks, statues and 
museums open when laborers can’t 
visit them. But the Heimwehr, four 
hundred thousand strong, is going to 
change Austria back to normaley.— 
On New Year’s Day, Mr. Hoover 
shook six thousand hands, chiefly be- 
cause neither he nor any of his prede- 
cessors in the presidency ever had the 
courage to refuse. Why not amuse these 
handshakers with bull-baiting ?—The 
government of the Empire State of 
New York has commenced its annual 
nonsense by disfranchising the cities, 
letting the backwoods dominate the 
Legislature, and the Legislature fight

Together, they succeed 
beautifully in delivering the state into 
the hands of the Superpower Trust.— 
Who owns the air? We know who 
owns the earth and the coal and iron 
under the earth, and the water on top 
of the earth, and the streets and roads 
and wires that run over it. But the 
question of the ownership of the air 
has not vet been settled. However, 
the National Broadcasting Corpora- 
tion is on the job.—A new, very seri- 
ous question confronts the Holland 
Dames, a patriotic and aristocratic or- 
ganization of New York State. Shall 
they be represented on the eternal 
monuments as descendants of peasants 
or of patroons of the Manor? Of 
dirty laborers, or of haughty nobility? 
We suggest a compromise. Why not 
paint them as jail birds or indentured 
servants? Several of these came over 
in the early migrating—Two million 
children are at work. ‘Two million 
grownups can find no work. But a 
Constitutional Amendment prohibiting

child labor would greatly interfere 
with American  freedom—General 


Smuts of the Union of South Africa 
has arrived and is lauding Pax Brit- 
tannica. But, unfortunately, British 
peace has never brought the right to 
rule and vote to a single colored na- 
tion on earth.—There will be no neu- 
trals in the next war if the Kellogg 
Pact and the Covenant of the League 
of Nations once get together. In 
which case, world wars will be the 
order of the day and God help the 
little folk!

MARCO POLO 


‘RISIS 











HEN | first told my friend, Jim 

McCracken, that I planned to 
make Negro friends, his countenance, 
reddened by the winds of Idaho corn- 
fields and Spanish wine fresh from the 
barrel, widened with his customary 
smile, generous and vulgar. ‘“White 
puddin’, eh?” He grinned, “White 
puddin’ for brown hungry appetites 
__, little girl, be careful!” But jim’s 
inherent grossness had been fostered by 
his career as longshoreman, harvester, 
hobo and seaman, and although ad- 
vanced on most questions, he could not 
in this instance overcome his sexual 
prejudices. 

Polly was hanging a cerise batik 
against that portion of her wall clear 
of art exhibits. Her studio, enormously 
spectacled with square windows over- 
looking the narrow tenements of the 
West End, is a meeting place for people 
whose metaphysical concept of art and 
life seems to find expression in deter- 
minedly arduous liquor parties. She 
burst forth: “Negro friends? Bring 
them up, by all means. Mad about 
them myself! Heard one of them orate 
at a Bahai meeting, but don’t know 
whether he was Negro or Hindu. He 
was black, anyway, and most fascina- 
ting. Incidentally, what will your 
Aunt Lydia say?” 

Now Aunt Lydia’s scientific attitude 
had been greatly reinforced by her 
summer's journey to the shrine of St. 
Anne de Beaupré, in Quebec city, 
where babies are granted by prayerful 
petition. Combined with this depend- 
able naiveté, she possesses a sense of 
humor which she manipulates in a mys- 
teriously charming way. Although 
forty years old, her hair is still webbed 
with the sun, and her eyes are as clear 
and bright as polished porcelain. 

“Negro friends?” Aunt Lydia looked 
appropriately puzzled, and offered her 
words in little throbs of measured ele- 
gance on the geranium pink casket of 
her lips. “How did you come by such 
an idea?” 

“Well, in the first place, I discovered 
a Negro poet. Countée Cullen is his 
name, 

“Sounds Gaelic to me,” said Aunt 
Lydia, dubiously. 

“In the second place, I’m going to 
attend a week-end party of Mrs. 
Whipple's, at which there will also be 
some colored people.” 

“You silly girl,” laughed my ador- 
ably goodnatured aunt, “Can’t you see 
the headlines? ‘Young poet chooses 
colored suitor for husband.’ Or better 
still, ‘Fair Nordic commits suicide, 


jilted by brown sheik’.” With due re-

Now I Know the Truth 


By LAURA TANNE 


Is it not curious that the mere 
meeting and acquaintanceship of 
human beings should constitute a 


grave human problem? Yet it 
does in America and here is a story 
about it. 





spect to the amiability of Aunt Lydia, 
it is only fair to say that she believed 
the continued preservation of her in- 
comparable contours and complexion 
depended upon a tranquility of temper, 
and a passivity of mind which would 
preclude: any dynamic notions or opin- 
ions. She practised good-nature like a 
trained seal. . . 

A teacher of political economy in a 
nearby university, addressed me _ sol- 
emnly, “This is a serious problem for 
a young girl like you. Negroes have 
less emotional restraint than Caucas- 
ions. The heritage of slavery in their 
blood produces traits of dishonesty and 
irresponsibility. Negro men Ne- 
gro men .”’ This reiteration had a 
fatefully ominous sound, like the clang 
of a ghostly bell in a dilapidated and 
cobwebbed garret. 

On the following Saturday, Mrs. 
Whipple’s landscape was daubed with 
a conglomerate humanity. They were 
grouped into tennis matches, hiking ex- 
peditions, and circles devoted to light 
and serious conversation; and it was 
not difficult to discover that Mrs. 
Whipple’s colored friends were largely 
chosen from the upper strata of the 
curious and complex society. White 
and colored lolled on the grass in fine 
camaraderie. A black bard was reading 
his poetry. Egyptian-eyed and swarthier 
than the rest, he brought a distinct for- 
eign note to the chaste New England 
landscape. The whites listened in gra- 
cious anticipation. The bard’s poems 
rolled off his tongue in soft, tender 
lisps, like a woman’s, 

Mrs. Whipple took my hand, “I 
want you to meet Rod Taylor and the 
rest.” 

Rod Taylor was a classmate of the 
black bard’s, a boy in whom blended 
races had apparently justified a glorious 
experiment in color. He was beautiful 
as few men are, with amber skin, a 
sensitive mouth, and eyes merry and in- 
telligent. Physically perfect, Rod 
seemed to typify the cultured, well-fed, 
colored student, who handles tragedy 
gingerly, and prefers a delicate, suave, 
aristocratic approach to fundamentally 
passionate issues. He had been partially 
emasculated by Harvard, academicized 
to a regrettable extent. He was intel- 
lectual but possessed the dilletante’s 


lack of abandon. It was easy to see 
that he was a woman’s prize, so lov- 
ingly and curiously did the women fol- 
low him with their eyes; especially the 
white women, to whom he was strange 
and fascinating. 

A festive-looking boy squatted on the 
grass opposite me, decked in an orange 
tie. Before dinner was announced from 
the top of the hill, I had learned he 
was studying anthropology, and was 
the pet of one of the most picturesque 
scholars in the educational and artistic 
life of the East. With a roguish de- 
tachment, he related in one breath the 
sociological significance of the various 
strata composing the Negro group, and 
in another he traced the history of the 
Spirituals, sharing with me several gra- 
cious anecdotes concerning well-known 
Negro writers and scientists of whom 
I was just beginning to learn. Rod 
Taylor, the black poet, and the orange- 
tie anthropologist, all possessed a finesse 
that was quite a distinct contrast to 
what my mind had been fed all my life. 
I had originally approached them with 
the feeling that a coal shovel, or an in- 
comprehensible dialect, or fried chicken 
wings, ought to be hovering some- 
where on the horizon, only to learn to 
my shame and innate embarrassment 
that they possessed an unmistakable 
aristocracy of spirit and manners, a 
Harvard accent, and cultural back- 
ground which would open my Aunt 
Lydia’s eyes considerably. 

Our evening dinner was clamorous 
with talk. The anthropologist calmly 
quoted a few statistics on miscegany, 
causing me to dig into my roast lamb 
with a fervor which hid the complete 
bewilderment of my mind. It was beau- 
tiful to contrast the tropical blondness 
of my white friend, Carl Cartright, 
his Celtic spontaniety and poetic aban- 
don, with Rod ‘Taylor’s _ perfectly 
groomed body, his aloof and proud black 
eyes, the tiny kinks in his hair touch- 
ing his cold brown neck timidly as if 
to say, “Do we little nests of heat 
belong to this cool bronze?” Carl and 
Rod, facing me at the table, were argu- 
ing vivaciously, yet it was easy to see 
that Carl had eyes only for the brown- 
skin dancr who returned his glance 
with a delicate, suave deliberation. She 
was the one with the throaty laughter, 
Harlemese slang, mannerisms Negroid 
on purpose: a Diana as golden as a 
summer bee, an athlete in drawing 
rooms. 

Dancing into early morning hours 
was a friendly hello across a dark 
chasm. The partners swayed to music, 
saying swift things to dispel the es- 


45 














trangement of distance. The little 
colored girl who writes quaint verse 
to her husband, danced with a young 
paleface, who, earlier in the evening, 
had remained apart in a doubtful mood. 
Her husband danced with a white theo- 
logical student, a girl with a name like 
an English novel, who resembled a 
German cook, and whose religious be- 
liefs had seduced her into the peculiar 
position of dancing with a Negro, well 
known for his religious and_ social 
iconoclasm. 

“So novel to you,” commented the 
orange-tie anthropologist, while the 
ivory and ebony keys chattered, “Why 
do I love you?” 

“Terribly much. Fascinating color 
pattern. Learning things. My ideas 
leap and sing now, and tell great 
stories. Learning much gee, it’s 
a lot of fun.” 


He smiled a friendly, condescending 
smile. ‘Oh, you’ll find we’re not at 
all different. We take our color mostly 
from the social stratum to which we 
belong. Perhaps we can discuss it fur- 
ther at dinner, sometime.” 

“TI am so glad you mentioned it,” | 
exclaimed, “I was going to ask you, 
otherwise.” 

Around the fireplace, later in the 
evening, we all shared marshmallows 
in shameless intimacy. We crooned 
songs, we laughed softly with that 
assurance of soul which knows its meas- 
ure of largeness and purpose. Weari- 
ness had gifts of. gentle relaxation 
which melted awareness of color into a 
graceful languor of unconscious com- 
radeship. The Negro iconoclast gazed 
into the fireplace with introspection. 
There was a terrible sadness and a 
terrible strength reflected in the depths 
of his black eyes. In gazing upon him, 
a breath of fierce heat crossed my 
brow, and truths destroying drawing 
room visions, strode like thunder upon 
my consciousness. During our discus- 
sion period, he had said: “This evidence 
of fellowship and friendship is very 
good. In it is the reflection of a rising 
freedom on the part of our young and 
new intelligentsia, whose courage is 
being increasingly reinforced by their 
possession of the best scientific knowl- 
edge of the day regarding civilization 
and race. To my colored friends: it is 
necessary to remind you that the social 
vertebrae of your group is composed of 
masses which you prefer to ignore. You 
are weaklings. It is these hordes, these 
masses, which are going to determine 
the ultimate status of the Negro. They 
contain the blood and brawn of our 
race, and with their scythes aad urban 
shovels, they are going to fashion the 
future. You poet, singing in your 
ebony tower, you had better listen to 
the sound of the wind blowing through 
the earth-grown grass, and learn the 


46 


difficult metre of mass rebellion, mass 
repression, mass aspiration. Then you 
will have something really great to 
sing. If your academic theories can not 
bear the brunt of these truths, you and 
your group are lost and your future as 
leaders of the race and as teachers and 
scholars, is already dust. e 

Sleepily we retired. My room, 
shared with Mimi, a little brown girl 
who writes extremely dramatic short 
stories, edged into pine trees as dark as 
the whisper of night. The stars were 
lost in mist and there was the sound of 
rain in the soft wind. Mimi braided 
her long crinkled hair and flashed her 
merry eyes at me. “This is great fun, 
here with all these futuristic people. 
I nearly got put in the same room with 
that blonde girl from Virginia. I just 
know she’d never go to bed with me. 
How about you?” 

“T think you’re lovely. Oh, 
aren’t you brown all over!” The tinkle 
of laughter smothered in muslin and 
pongee pajamas was indicative of our 
mood. 





“Oh, you'll find we’re not at all different!” 


The large mirror facing us reflected 
our smiling faces. We eyed each other 
thoughtfully. Mimi’s dark braids fell 
like heavy hands over her rich brown 
arms. My blonde head rested mis- 
chievously against her dark one. 


“If Senator Heflin could see us. 
” 


We sat on the edge of the bed and 
my toes touched her brown ones like 
perverted promises of white rhododen- 
drons or pale sea shells. I addressed 
them: ““That you, because your color is 
white, should have a predetermined free 
sphere of life in which to travel, while 
other feet, equally pretty and equally 
worthwhile in social value, should have 


an involuntary, restricted area for pro. 
gression simply because they are darker 
in hue, is manifestly unfair, atrociously 
so. How do these birds that run the 
world get away with it, anyway ?” 

In the chill of night, we snuggled 
close to each other like birds in a nest, 
In the mystery of the darkness, the yel- 
low threads of my hair became ep- 
tangled in Mimi’s dark braids, and our 
breaths entwined their essence with the 
mystic harmony of youth. So we slept 
and dreamed. . . . 


Monday morning had a great blue 
mouth full of sunlight. Mimi and | 
joined the first group leaving for town, 
Across the green, a little Scotch girl 
who had motored over Sunday night, 
was walking with black bard, her hand 
clasped in his with the confidence of a 
child. 

“We're taking the ten-ten for town,” 
we shouted to them. 


The little country railroad station 
harbored with placidity this group 
which shook the provincial New Eng- 
land walls with exuberant pagan laugh- 
ter. The brown-skin dancer was ex- 
changing Harlemese with the exotic 
blonde boy. Some one was inviting 
black bard to tea. Our train compart- 
ment was thick with talk. Farewells 
at the end of our journey were simply 
preliminaries to further plans between 
newly made friends whom destiny had 
previously kept apart. 


Aunt Lydia was removing a box of 
fresh mushrooms which Uncle Hobbsy 
had placed on the living room table. 


“Don’t tell me,” she said crossly, 
“that you’ve been wandering around 
with Negroes the last two days.” 

“Uh-huh, I have,” said I, ‘and find- 
ing out how much I’ve been gypped by 
the know-it-all muck-a-mucks who 
build our schools and finance our 
churches and run our newspapers, and 
make it impossible to get the truth 
without dirtying one’s self prying 
through all the mean lies in the uni- 


WEES cise 


“Oratorical, eh?” answered Aunt 
Lydia cynically. ‘Well, what’s the 
latest, in connection with this enter- 
prise of yours?” 

“Dinner Tuesday. Student of an- 
thropology, a short story writer and 
her sweetheart. All colored.” 

Aunt Lydia smothered her cigarette 
contemplatively. “I shall be out with 
Hobbsy, as a gesture of my disap- 
proval.” 

“That’s not so violent of you,” I ad- 
mitted, quite pleased, “I’ll make some 
tea biscuits, myself, and hope for the 
best.” 


And I did.

have joined hands to carry out the 
program which will ultimately reduce 
the distressingly high death rate of the 
Negro in America. 

At an organization luncheon held a 
few days later, Edwin R. Embree, 
president of the Julius Rosenwald 
Fund, said that this was the most im- 
portant undertaking with which the 
Fund had been connected, so far as 
Negro welfare is concerned. 

Provident Hospital and Training 
School has always emphasized the 
teaching aspect. It was founded by 
white and colored citizens, including 
Philip Danforth Armour, George H. 
Webster, Herman H. Kobhlsaat, Dr. 
C. E. Bentley, George M. Pullman, 


Marshall Field, Cyrus H. McCor- 
mick and Dr. Daniel H. Williams, 
who later established the Nurses 


Training School at Freedmen’s Hos- 
pital in Washington. The Board of 
Trustees from the beginning has in- 
cluded members of both races, as has 
the staff of the hospital. Many emi- 
nent white physicians received part of 
their training at Provident Hospital. 

The enlarged institution will carry 
out the same policy established so long 
ago, but with a greatly broadened 
scope of teaching and research and 
with special emphasis on the _post- 


graduate and advanced medical work. 

The program provides the follow- 
ing: 

1. Medical and surgical care of 
the sick, in a modern hospital and 
out-patient department with a full- 
time staff of highly trained physicians 
and surgeons, and with modern equip- 
ment and laboratory facilities for 
diagnosis and treatment of disease. 

2. An increased number of intern- 
ships for medical school graduates. 
3. Post-graduate education 

training. 

4+. Opportunities for teaching and 
research as well as clinical surgery and 
the specialties. Through the gen- 
erosity of the Rosenwald Fund, a 
number of research fellowships will be 
awarded annually on a competitive 
basis. 

5. The study of Negro public 
health problems and the training of 
public health workers. 

6. Training of Negro nurses un- 


and 


der improved conditions and_ in 
greater numbers. 
7. Training of technicians for 


laboratory and other hospital work 
and development of hospital adminis- 
trators. 

8. The study of social problems 
and training of social workers. 


The Board of Trustees is composed 
of A. L. Jackson, who is a prominent 
civic leader, president; Judge Albert 
B. George, secretary; George R. Ar- 
thur, of the Rosenwald Fund, treas- 
urer; Dr. Otho F. Ball, publisher of 
Hospital Management; Henry P. 
Chandler, attorney and former presi- 
dent of the Chicago City Club; Leon 
S. Chichester, David Manson, retired 
capitalist; Joseph W. Bibb, editor of 
the Chicago Whip; Loring W. Cole- 
man, treasurer of Passevant Hospital; 
Dr. George Cleveland Hall, promi- 
nent surgeon and chief of staff; 
Dwight Ingram, vice-president of 
Griffin, Ingram & Paff; William J. 
MacKenzie, vice-president of Inter- 
state Iron & Steel Company; Joseph 
W. Moore, Alfred C. Meyer, presi- 
dent of Michael Reese Hospital; Rev- 
erend John B. Redmond; Haven A. 
Requa, vice-president of the Chicago 
Coal & Dock Company; James Simp- 
son, Jr., of Marshall Field & Com- 
pany; and the Reverend George H. 
‘Thomas. 

The advisory committee consists of 
James E. MacMurray, chairman of 
the board of the Acme Steel Company; 
Judge Robert McMurdy and Roy O. 
West, former secretary of the U. S. 
Department of the Interior. 


Exploitation or Co-operation? 


N the December and January num- 

bers of THE Crisis we published 
the first installments of this paper 
which received the first economic prize 
of $100 in our contest last summer. 
In this essay, Mr. Matney has made a 
study of the restricted occupations of 
Negroes and of discrimination in their 
expenditure. He then made a brief 
study of Negro business and showed 
how it was handicapped in competition 
with the chain store. He then turned 
to agriculture and concluded that the 
“Negro was not holding his own there, 
asserting that Negro agricultural 
schools “have not solved and will not 
solve the problem of Negro success in 
Agriculture.” 

The way out to Mr. Matney’s mind 
is Co-operative Business and the Janu- 
ary article explains the nature and ex- 
tent of co-operative business in the 
United States. The present and con- 
cluding installment sums up the extent 
of co-operation in Europe, and the pos- 
sibility of applying co-operation as a 
solution of the economic difficulties of 
the Negro in America.

By W. C. MATNEY 


It is evident that the Negro is 
suffering from conditions in the 
economic order over which he has 


no control. The question naturally 
arises, how can relief be obtained, 
or what is the way out? 





In practically every country of 
Europe the co-operative movement has 
long been an established phase of eco- 
nomic life. Today co-operation has an 
enormous grasp upon 50,000,000 fam- 
ilies in 36 countries of the world.** 

The British Co-operative Con- 
sumers’ Movement is composed of 4,- 
800,000 families. It employs 186,000 
people. Its productive industries em- 
ploy 77,000 people. 

Co-operation has brought Denmark 
from poverty to prosperity. Several 
European universities have established 
a professorship in co-operation.

The total number of co-operative 
credit associations in the world is 85, 
000, having a membership of 25,000,- 
000 and doing an annual business of 
$12,000,000,000. The Bank of the 
English Wholesale has a turnover of 
more than £500,000,000 yearly. The 
French Co-operative Wholesale Society 
own two hundred railroad cars for 
transportation of goods for the society. 
Many other European societies own 
freight cars. The British Wholesale 
own several steamships. The German 
Wholesale has at Groba its own tracks 
and its own locomotives. Steamships 
and ocean steamers are owned by some 
societies. 

Co-operative business in Great 
Britain has a membership equal to one- 
third of the total population.”

erative banks or credit unions, as they 
are called in the United States, have 
developed at an astounding pace until 
now there are more than 900 of these 
organizations with assets of from $25,- 
000,000 to $30,000,000 and 250,000 
members scattered throughout 27 
states. ‘The credit unions have made 
war on the loan sharks. ‘The func- 
tions of the credit union are three- 
fold: rb 

a. To promote thrift among mem- 

bers through a system of sav- 
ing. 

b. To create credit resources for 
members at legitimate rates of 
interest. 

To educate the members in mat- 
ters having to do with the man- 
agement and control of money. 

The essence of the credit union is 
self help. 

A striking characteristic of co-opera- 
tive banks is that they suffer no losses. 
According to bulletin 437 of the Bu- 
reau of Labor Statistics, the losses 
formed only three-tenths of one per 
cent for all the loans made in 1925. 
The same bulletin also calls attention 
to the low cost of operating the credit 
union. The average expense of opera- 
tion was only 1.80 per cent of the loans 
made during the year.

Monetary Returns of Co-operation 


In this connection I shall call your 
attention to bulletin 437, Bureau of 
abor Statistics. The last paragraph 
on page 3, reads as follows: 


More than three-quarters of a 


February, 1930 


million dollars in dividends were dis- 
tributed to members by the societies 
which paid dividends. This was an 
average of 3.8 per cent on the basis 
of sales,—a very high earning power 
in these stores if the dividends be fig- 
ured on capital—29.3 per cent. It is 
doubtful if private business can excel 
such a showing, especially when it is 
considered on their capital investment. 
The lifetime financial returns of some 
of these societies are worthy of note, 
and demonstrate that a co-operative 
store owned and_ operated demo- 
cratically may be run as efficiently as 
a private business.” 

Two things in particular have made 
for the success of the co-operatives: 
first, adequate groups of real co-opera- 
tors infused with the co-operation prin- 
ciples; second, the undertakings have 
been run on sound co-operative meth- 
ods and principles. 

The advantages accruing to the 
members of co-operative enterprises are 
many. Aside from the monetary bene- 
fits derived, co-operation acquaints its 
members with the practical methods 
and policies of business administration, 
develops an awakened economic inter- 
est, promotes the spirit of mutual ser- 
vice, teaches thrift, and develops soli- 
darity. 


Co-operative League of America 


There is today in the United States 
a federation of co-operative societies. 
This federation is the Co-operative 
League of America. The League 
makes surveys; publishes information; 
gives advice; standardizes methods; 
prepares by-laws for societies; main- 
tains a bureau of auditing and ac- 
counting; promotes favorable legisla- 
tion; sends out advisors to societies; 
prepares study courses; and in every 
way possible promotes the extension of 
practical co-operation. Through the 
League, the United States movement 
is connected with the International 
Alliance, a federation of national co- 
operatives throughout the world. 


Plan of Approach for the Negro 


Can the advantages and by-products 
of co-operative business be of material 
service in Negro life? 

Has the Negro the elements which 
are the requisites for success in co- 
operative business ? 

It is the opinion of the writer, based 
on several years of study of co-opera- 
tion and having sat in two of the 
National Co-operative Congresses, that 
co-operation offers great promise of be- 
ing the solution for the economic riddle 
confronting the Negro, just as it has 
been a way out for other oppressed 
groups for over three-quarters of a 
century. 









































There is undoubtedly sufficient lat- 
ent co-operative sentiment in the Ne- 
gro, enough socially-minded individuals 
possessing the vision and the energy. 

The problem is how to launch and 
put over the co-operative movement 
among Negroes? In other words, the 
launching of the movement is a prob- 
lem of approach. 

The steps toward the establishment 
of consumers’ co-operation among Ne- 
groes in America would seem to in- 
clude the following:

ENERAL discussions on_inter- 
marriage usually get no where 
because there is no agreement as to 
fundamental facts. In the January 
Crisis, we publishd a genuine specific 
case and after giving our own opinion, 


asked the opinions of our readers. 
Here are a few: 
In regard to the letter ‘About 


Marrying” recently printed in your es- 
teemed paper, it seems to me that the 
young people should be advised to fol- 
low their inclinations as to marriage. 

The question of racial intermarriage 
is a vital one, and one upon which con- 
servatives and progressives differ. If 
we believe in economic and social equal- 
ity of the races, we must perforce be- 
lieve in racial intermarriage. Racial in- 
ter-marriage and amalgamation of the 
races, however hateful to the reaction- 
ary, is favored by all those who have 
the feeling that all men are created 
equal, irrespective of color. 

In the case of love between the races, 
questions of expediency vanish. The 
question is, is love worth while? If 
so, we must approve of the marriage 
of the young couple. 

A White Woman of Connecticut. 


In the Postscript of the January 
number of THE Crisis, the letter of 
the young white man in love with a 
mulatto girl has drawn my sympathy 
and I respond to your invitation to 
give him advice. 

Since he states they have been sepa- 
rated for six years, I think he should 
continue it. 

Marriage such as he contemplates 
would involve a‘! that you have sug- 
gested, ostracism, insult and embar- 
rassment in public places—possible loss 
of work and difficulty in getting other 
work—and while he and, perhaps, she 
may be willing to endure it all for 
each other’s sake—if he loves her as 
he claims he does, he will not want her 

“to suffer martyrdom in seeing her chil- 
dren boycotted by both his race and her 
race and perhaps endure the reproaches 
they may fling upon their parents. 

Other men in love have considered 
the loved one’s best interest on happi- 
ness before their own desires, and in 
my opinion, they have chosen the bet- 
ter part. 

A Colored Woman of Texas. 





My advice to you is, “Don’t”. Not 
that the cause which occasions your 
letter does not need a champion nor 
that the issue is not simply just spoil-

Inter-Marriage: A Symposium 


ing for a franker demonstration of its 
possibilities for good and ill, but after 
reading your letter I am convinced be- 
yond even the shadow of a doubt that 
you are not the one to start a crusade 
which doubtless requires unusual qual- 
ities of a pioneer soul in the realm of 
things social. 

That you have thus through the past 
five years wavered on the brink of 
decision and that you now seek advice 
from without to aid you, or confirm 
you in a decision already made in a 
momentous and necessarily personal 
matter, reveal most significantly your 
attitudes which would hardly stand the 
supreme testing which the union you 
propose might involve. The cause, like 
all controversial issues of historical 
record, stands in need of the services of 
potential martyrs willing to offer 
themselves in the clinic of social investi- 
gation and research, but I fear (and on 
this statement I risk whatever reputa- 
tion I may have as a psychologist as 
well as prophet) you do not possess 
the abdominal ingredients which con- 
stitute the visceral investiture of tradi- 
tional witnesses unto death. 

Then let me, at the risk of appear- 
ing unkind, suggest that you turn your 
attentions and deliver your affections 
to another where only the ordinary 
(and God only knows what they be) 
risks attend. Assuming again the ana- 
lytic role for which I have already 
rendered an implied apology, let me 
predict that you will find the solace 
which your nature seems to require and 
to the ultimate utter exclusion of the 
former attachment. 

O yes, the libraries are full of books 
which treat of the matter which seems 
to trouble you. We have in ten-thou- 
sand volume lots the stories of men 
who have dared convention and of- 
fered a willing sacrifice for the dem- 
onstration of the worthwhileness of 
principles which they deemed eternal. 
Read again, with this in mind, the 
story of the young Galilean carpenter 
whose philosophy was so new and 
strange and simple that he had to be 
summarily dealt with before he had 
time to turn right-side up the topsy 
turvy world to which he came. Read 
of Joan of Arc,—Saint Joan now, who 
saw light through the mists of doubt 
and fear which hovered so darkly over 
her beloved land. Read of Savonarola 
Martin Luther, John Brown, Wm. 
Lloyd Garrison, Moorfield Storey, and 
the Rev. Mr. Adelbert J. Helm, late 
of Detroit. Yes, the library of your 
home town is full of books—but I fear 
they won’t do you any good in your 
present predicament nor help you in the 








solution of the personal problem which 
you raise. 
A Colored Man of Colorado, 


The young man seems to know the 
difficulties he and his loved one will 
have to go through and the social s- 
tracism they will have to face from 
both white and colored, and it’s for him 
to decide if his love is strong enough 
to stand up under those things. If 
he thinks “the world well lost for love” 
then let him hop to it. Of course, she 
has to make the same decision, although 
he doesn’t mention what she thinks 
about their union. He seems to think, 
man-like, that all he has to do is pro- 
pose and with a little “persuasion” 
she'll fly to his arms. He doesn’t seem 
to realize that such a marriage would 
mean as much sacrifice on her part as 
on his. 

Personally, | wouldn't have him. If 
he had a love to offer her that was 
great enough to compensate her for the 
loss of so much, he would have taken 
her long ago. 

A Colored Woman of New York. 


And now for the young Nordic wnu 
wants to marry a Negress. I do not 
think that the sage advice of 
Punch was ever so witty, so pithy, 
and so full of worldly wisdom as 
when applied to the Great Ques 
tion now confronting this young man. 
Your answer, Dear Dr. Du Bois, leaves 
nothing to say on the subject provid- 
ing one inclines to your angle of opin- 
ion. So that there is nothing to say 
unless one has a different perspective. 
I have. I say to the young man “You 
cannot!” The institution of Mar- 
riage from the most impartial stand- 
point must be regarded as a cove- 
nant between the individual and the 
Social Order. ‘The Social Order en- 
dows its highest privileges, dignities, 
and protection, upon the individual in 
return for conformity with its laws and 
customs. In short, the utmost any man 
can do for any woman, is to marty 
her; the utmost any woman can do for 
any man is to marry him. Of all hu 
man institutions that of marriage has 
unique significance. The term, “A re- 
spectable married woman—or man 
loses not one particle of value when 
applied to prince or pauper, Negro or 
Nordic. One marries to confer upon 
the partner the highest of all human 
distinctions. Then how can one think 
of marriage if this high distinction be 
not forthcoming? How dare this young 
man expose this young woman (an

Crisis 











HE literary output of 1929 has 

been notable and encouraging. 
First, we may consider what Negro 
authors have done. ‘The most impor- 
tant books by Negroes published dur- 
ing 1929 have been: 

R. R. Moton, “What the 

Thinks”. 

Jessie Fauset, “Plum Bun”. 

Nella Larsen, “Passing”’. 

Walter White, “Rope and Faggot”. 

Harry Dean, “The Pedro Gorino”. 

Countée Cullen, “The Black Christ”. 

Claude McKay, “Banjo”. 

The Volume on the American Negro 
by the American Academy of Political 
and Social Science came out at the end 
of the year 1928, and thus in effect be- 
longs to this year. It is done principally 
by colored writers and is the most im- 
portant compendium published in ten 
years.

WHAT ONE BRANCH DID 

The work of the large branches of 
the Association in important cities of 
the country, is essential to its continu- 
ance. But the work of small branches 
is no less essential. It is a pleasure to 
dwell on the extraordinary results ob- 
tained by the loyalty and team work 
of one such small branch, in Jamaica, 
Long Island. Its apportionment for 
the year was $500. Not content mere- 
ly with exceeding that apportionment, 
the branch more than doubled it send- 
ing to the National Office the sum ot 
$1,017.43. Part of this was raised by 
the energetic membership campaign 
conducted by branch officers; part by 
a popular baby contest, in which the 
winner was Billy Pierce, Jr., son ot 
the celebrated instructor of dancing 
who is known wherever an orchestra 
playe on Broadway. The officers of the 
Jamaica, Long Island branch are Dr. 
C. M. Reid, President; George W. 
Murray, Vice President; Frank MI. 
Turner, Secretary; Charles Stovall, 
Treasurer; Mrs. Romeo L. Daugherty, 
Chairman Membership Committee; 
Charles Shaw, Jr., Publicity Chair- 
man. 


WORK DONE AND THE 
FUTURE 
The Twentieth Anniversary year of 
the National Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Colored People, offered 
a vantage point from which a survey 
could be made of what had been ac- 








THE N.A.A.C.P. BATTLE FRONT 








complished. By the written testimony 
of leaders who mold public opinion, 
both in the United States and Eng- 
land, the Association was felt to have 
gone far upon its chosen way. The en- 
tire problem of race relations had been 
dramatized. Subjects once taboo had 
been opened to the widest and frank- 
est discussion. In the process, much of 
error and misconception had _ been 
cleared away. New avenues had been 
established of contact, so that the Ne- 
gro might present his achievements 
and his human dignity to the consid- 
eration of all who read. And powerful 
defenders in law, hammering away per- 
sistently at the legal armor of the 
Negro’s constitutional and civil rights, 
had turned many a scrap of paper into 
part of the document of real eman- 
cipation. 

In twenty years, it was seen by all 
that a great deal affecting the realm 
of race relations had totally changed. 
As Mr. Embree, President of the 
Rosenwald Fund, pointed out at the 
Cleveland Conference, the Negro 
speaks now not as a suppliant, but as 
a citizen of the country, recognized as 
such, with the duties as well as the 
rights of citizenship. 

This is far from intimating that the 
battle in behalf of justice between the 
races has been won. Eloquent testi- 
mony of the barriers still remaining to 
be surmounted, is contained in a report 
of the work done during the year just 
past. This report shows the N.A.A. 


C.P. still fighting on as many fronts

as ever, confronted by problems of the 
gravest interest to every colored man 
and woman and child in the country, 

It would be impossible in this space 
to give any adequate idea of the work 
which the Association does in a year 
and has done in the year past. That js 
attempted in the Annual Report. Bu 
it may be well to consider some of the 
things attempted and accomplished 
during 1929 for the light they throw 
into the future. 

First of all, perhaps, it seems estab- 
lished that the N.A.A.C.P. is a voice 
which speaks in behalf of colored 
America and is heard when it speaks. 
That was shown in the three struggles 
against the color bar, one in Christian 
churches and the other two, in the field 
of sport, which the Association carried 
to a victory before public opinion. The 
church Jim Crow utterances of a 
Protestant Episcopal and a Catholic 
clergyman were repudiated by their 
respective superiors in the church hier- 
archy; New York University was 
obliged to announce tha: their star 
colored quarterback, whom it had been 
intended to bar from play with Geor- 
gia, would be in the game if physically 
fit, and the U. S. Lawn Tennis Asso- 
ciation, which barred two excellent 
young colored players from the na 
tional junior indoor tournament, was 
put on the defensive by the N.A.A.C.P. 
protest. In all three of these contests 
public sentiment rallied strongly to the 
position maintained by the N.A.A.C.P.

Crisis 








E are not concerned with the 
W story of Albert Bruce Cook 
solely because he has achieved a rea- 
sonable financial success. There are 
other colored men, who have made 
more money, but we do not think 
success can be measured entirely in 
terms of money. Our interest lies 
in the shrewd ability that enabled 
this man to build a thriving concern 
from a very ordinary beginning. 
Men have been cutting lawns and 
beating carpets for many years, but 
very few have considered founding 
a business on these prosaic tasks. 

To properly appreciate the work 
of Albert Cook, one must go back 
to the days when he was church 
sexton in the little town of Bloom- 
field, New Jersey. He had grown 
tired of the monotonous routine and 
drudgery that attended his daily 
tasks. Mere dissatisfaction, how- 
ever, is not sufficient in itself, it 


requires positive action to bring 
forth improvement. When a man 
has had only twelve months of 


schooling, when he has a family de- 
pendent on him, it also takes real grit 
to leave the comparative security of 
even a mediocre job. Nevertheless Mr. 
Cook quit his job, determined to find 
something better. Having been bossed 
all of his life, he now decided to be 
his own boss, 

His first independent venture was a 
household service company. It was a 
clever idea and showed that Albert 
Cook had the imagination to see the 
possibilities lurking in the most ordi- 
nary tasks. Briefly his plan was to se- 
lect a group of workers and take over 
all of the odd jobs that arise on every 
large estate. Such work as beating 
carpets, mowing the lawn, tending the 
garden and tasks of kindred natures 
would come within the scope of his 
concern. It happens, that there are 
many large residences in the vicinity 
of Bloomfield, and the owners readily 
listened to his plan. Hired men had 
not always done their work satisfac- 
torily. Mr. Cook offered to “service” 
their estates in the same way that they 
had their cars serviced in the shop. 

The success of this scheme was al- 
most immediate. Mr. Cook selected 
his employees with care and insisted 
that their work be done with thor- 
oughness. His patrons pleased with 
the results, became valuable advertisers 
and through their recommendations, 
new customers were constantly added 
to the list. People from the surround- 
ing communities were soon sending for

From House Cleaner to Business Executive 


By JOHN W. DOUGLAS 





Albert Bruce Cook 


this little colored enterprise to do their 
work. 

Then came misfortune, but it was 
not due to any bad management or 
lack of good faith on the company’s 
part. The World War had at last 
reached the United States and Mr. 
Cook’s employees had to leave for the 
trenches. Naturally with his men 
gone to war and the government call- 
ing on all available men to. become 
soldiers, Albert Cook had to abandon 
his enterprise for a time at least. 

Success has’ a strange way of ap- 
pearing at times in. the guise of failure. 
At the very moment when life seemed 
at its darkest, Albert Cook was really 
on the verge of greater accomplish- 
ments. 

Having enjoyed the increased self 
respect that results from independence, 
Albert Cook could not brook the idea 
of again working for a boss. His 
problem was to find some other busi- 
ness that would enable him to con- 
tinue using his old list of patrons. 
The carpet cleaning business was just 
such an enterprise. It would yield a 
large net profit and the use of ma- 
chinery would compensate for the lack 
of individual workers. For six months 
he studied the proposition. He knew 
nothing about the type of machinery to 
buy, but the proper apparatus was 
finally secured. At the outset this man 
with commendable shrewdness, de- 
termined to bid for white customers. 
“We are ‘too skeptical about the 
whites”, he said. ‘We ought to try 


and sell to them as well as to our 

own.” So it was that when the 

Essex County Carpet Cleaning 

Works, Inc. was formed a white 

man was taken in as an associate 

of Mr. Cook and his wife. 

Now that he was going into busi- 
ness on a larger scale, he decided to 
advertise extensively. He began by 
sending out notices to prospective 
customers; today his mailing list 
contains fifty thousand names. Fur- 
thermore he does not confine him- 
self to the town in which he lives, 
but is constantly reaching out until 
his business territory now includes 
fourteen different communities. 

Of course there were difficulties. 
Soon after he rented quarters for 
his machinery, hostile elements 
complained that the heavy appara- 
tus shook the building. ‘The com- 
pany moved to a new location. 
Later it decided to buy a plot and 
erect a factory. The building is 
a modern brick factory located 

on Race Street, in Bloomfield, N. J. 
Albert Cook had the foresight to have 
it insured for one hundred thousand 
dollars against loss by fire. In 1926 a 
fire did break out and the damage 
amounted to seventy thousand dollars. 
The entire loss was immediately paid 
off. 

The first part of this narrative 
would be incomplete without adequate 
mention of Mrs. Helen Cook. She is 
just as much responsible for the suc- 
cess of the Bloomfield concern as her 
husband. Always sympathetic with 
his aspirations she has never ceased to 
aid him with her efforts. When Mr. 
Cook was doing janitor work, his 
wife worked with him; when the ser- 
vice company was inapperation, Mrs. 
Cook did much ofsthé Hi@mge cleaning 
and when the carpet cleaning concern 
was organized; she took charge of 
whatever sewing work that was neces- 
sary. Even today she shampoos rugs, 
cuts them into runners, does the hem- 
ming and altering. When the writer 
saw her one evening, she was busily 
engaged in preparing a large number 
of circulars for mailing. The only 
thing that this energetic lady doesn’t 
do is operate the heavy carpet beating 
machinery. Mrs. Cook holds the 
unique position of director of the cor- 
poration in which she is also an all 
around worker. 

The great migration of colored peo- 
ple from the Southland gave rise to 
many problems. The most pressing of

A Maori Statesman 


EW ZEALAND is one of the 
countries where two _ peoples 
have worked out a plan of living to- 
gether in a co-operative life. The 
Maoris, the native race, have full 
rights of citizenship. They elect their 
own members to the legislature, and 
many of them have held the highest 
official positions. Of these, one of the 
most distinguished has been the Hon- 
orable Sir Maui Pomare, of pure 
Maori blood.* He was born in 1876 
near Taranaki, in the Northern Island, 
the son of Chief Wirema Naera. After 
his school days at the Christ church 
boys’ high school, he went on to Te 
Aute, the leading Maori college. And 
he had amibitions to be a doctor. So 
he came to the United States, and was 
an early pupil of Dr. Kellogg at the 
Battle Creek Sanitarium. Returning 
with his degree of M. D., he was ap- 
pointed the first medical officer to the 
native race, and held the position for 
ten years, only resigning it in 1911, 
when he was elected a member of the 
House of Representatives for the 
Western Maori electorate, the seat he 
still holds. 
His executive ability was so marked 
that he was drawn into many impor-

tant positions, notably that of Minister 
of Public Health in the Massey ad. 
ministration. During 1927 and 1928 
he headed the Department of Public 
Affairs, until the Reform Party was 
defeated in the last general election, 
His retirement was widely regretted, 


He has done much to raise the stand- 
ards of health and hygiene for his own 
race, and undoubtedly deserves a large 
share of the credit for the lowered 
death-rate in their ranks. The Maori 
population, recorded in 1886 as 43- 
927, by 1926 had risen to 63,670, or 
an increase of almost fifty per cent. 


Sir Maui Pomare was one of the 
first members of the Young Maori 
Party, which realized that the time had 
come when many of the original tribal 
customs, and forms of’ social life would 
have to pass. As Twentieth Century 
New Zealanders, and citizens in the 
British Empire, they felt that these 
could no longer be maintained unmodi- 
fied. More and more, the Maoris are 
sharing in the general life of the com- 
munity, and in that way making their 
contribution to social progress. 


Lady Pomare, also Maori, charm- 
ing and popular, has been her hus- 
band’s aid all through his public life. 
There are two sons and a daughter.

THE OUTER POCKET | 








¢6TCOR four years the colored peo- 

F ple of Elk City have done all 
they could to get a public school here. 
There are not many of us in this 
county, nevertheless, we are due a pub- 
lic school. The largest group of us in 
and near Elk City—about 250 grown 
people and 40 or more children of 
school age. ‘There is not one public 
school for Negro youth in this county. 

“The County Superintendent at 
Sayre sends us to E. E. Cowan, Super- 
intendent of Schools at Elk City, and 
he claims that the County Superintend- 
ent must act in the matter. Hence, 
we get no school. 

“The School Board of Elk City— 
Walter B. Hedlund, President, J. T. 
Beall, Secretary, and Drew Watkins 
will not act in our favor, so we have 
no means of getting a public school. 

“T have urged the people to send the 
matter to Oklahoma City to the state 
authorities but the wisdom of such a 
course is greatly doubted, as some of us 
will surely be driven away from Elk 
City, and for this reason I have refused 
to write to Dr. James Dillard of Char- 
lottesville, Virginia. Friends told me 
that Mr. Dillard would send my letter 
to a representative at the Capitol of 
Oklahoma and the letter would finally 
reach officers at Elk City. 

“If there be any possible chance to 
help these colored youth without put- 
ting any of us in a critical condition or 
exposing this letter, please do so. We 
are in great need.” 





I have been reading THE Crisis for 
years and have contributed each time 
that you have asked me, though little 
but I have given what I could, and I 
am asking that you continue THE 
Crisis to me as long as I donate to the 
fund, and that will be as long as I am 
able to rake up the money. 

Dr. A. E. Beatty, Oklahoma. 


I would very gladly write personal- 
ly from time to time for THE CrisIs. 
There is no magazine that has helped 
me so much to understand the situation 
in America and I have always had the 
profoundest admiration for the work 
you have been doing through this paper. 

C. F. Andrews, India. 


For some time I have been reading 
Tue Crisis and during that time it has 
Temained the same, a bitter, narrow, 
critical little pamphlet. As the lead- 
ing Negro magazine, why on earth 


February, 1930 








can’t it be made worthwhile? Of 
course, we all know that the whites are 
not what they should be, but why harp 
on that continuously when there are so 
many more interesting and worthwhile 
things to talk about? .. . 


Why should we stand and stamp and . 


spit and sputter like a spoiled child that 
cannot have its way. Be like “Jack, 
the Giant Killer.” Show through the 
magazine the great things that Negroes 
are doing in place of always telling 
of what some one is doing to us. 
Grace Vann, 
Chappaqua, New York. 


I should like to take this opportun- 
ity of telling you how much I appre- 
ciate your journal, I am an Eng- 
lishman, and I love my race and my 
country. THE Crisis helps me to 
love judiciously ! 

One final word. For the concen- 
trated essence of criticism, 1 know 
nothing to touch “As the Crow Flies”! 

Yours sincerely, 
J. B. HutcHinson 


I must thank you very sincerely, not 
only for telling me where to write for 
the Atlanta Studies, but for your kind- 
ness in sending the few copies of THE 
CrisIs. 

I am delighted with it. It is most 
interesting and the illustrations are so 
beautifully done. When I have care- 
fully read all the paper, as I intend 
doing, I shall feel as if I am begin- 
ning to know a little about your 
people.

Your printed acknowledgement of 
the receipt of my subscription was re- 
ceived last week. 

In the second paragraph you state: 
“We assume that you approve of THE 
Crisis because you are a subscriber.” 
Kindly permit me to qualify this state- 
ment. You correctly call THE Crisis 
a “radical periodical”. The radical, 
Bolshevistic character is to be regretted. 
It always hurts me to see this otherwise 
excellent magazine deformed by this 
feature. Could you not, Dr. Du Bois, 
spare your Christian readers, who very 
likely are in the majority, this pain?

Chief Police and his assistant here

them a copy of THe Crisis also The 
Defender. This was during the Kan- 
sas riot. Now you know that preju- 
dice exists here against all colored pa- 
pers. The officers did not tell me to 
discontinue my delivery here but re- 
marked they don’t want those papers 
here. Now please advise me, should 
they continue to agitate and demand 
me to discontinue: can I get support 
from your office to help me any way? 
What I want is this: Could you ar- 
range help from the Federal authorities 
some way? All it would need is just 
seme man able to reach to be- 
gin investigation at the Post Office and 
to get out in the city a little. These 
little prejudiced officers can be easily

Please rush my order.

Dear Sir: 
I have recently been reading certain 
books from your pen, and I have been 
thoroughly delighted with them. It 
is seldom that such charming, force- 
ful and delightful essays can be found 
anywhere. 

As I was reading them I was struck 
with the idea that perhaps you can 
help me solve a little problem of mine, 
that we both have a share in because 
it is interracial. I am a white girl of 
twenty-three years, who, ever since an 
interracial commission I attended in 
college made possible friendship with 
Negro students, has been heart and 
soul striving to break down interracial 
barriers. 

On the plea that white students 
were not willing to back up their state- 
ments with their lives, I was persuaded 
to attend the Southern Colored Stu- 
dents Conference last June. I went 
simply as a delegate like all the others, 
and I thoroughly enjoyed the experi- 
ence, and would repeat it this year if 
I were financially able to do so. At 
that time I lost every particle of su- 
periority I ever had, and now looking 
back I wonder why I ever had any. 

With these ideas I began teaching 
in Georgia last fall. Before leaving, 
the whole town, including the K. K. K. 
were so opposed to my influence over 
their children that I was forced to re- 
sign. I would perhaps have stayed on 
te see what steps the K. K. K. would 
actually take had not discipline been 
hard to maintain with none of the par-

To wait ’pon ol’ Marse Tom 
To shoo off flies, while ol’ Marse slept 
And when ol’ Marse woke 
Go fetch his pipe and bring his book 
And mix the mint-julep

cotton bandana 

Knotted about your head and a corn cob

Is thrust between your strong white

You amble down still lanes patterned 
with the shadows 

Of Spanish moss. Your gold hoop ear-

Relic of a wilder life glint in the sun. 

God! how mellow are the sounds of your 
voices 

They are so sweet they chime with the 
bronze cowbells 

Chime sifted by Southern sunlight, the 
carillon of the South. 


You wear a red 


I love your tumble-down shanties 
With the leaning clay chimneys and the 


palmettos 

Spiked in the dooryard. A _ horde of 
chickens 

Peck about the cabin floor. Small chil-

Many of them, bodies tinted a warm 
coffee color 

Or a warmer chocolate, play and laugh 
in the sun. 

All of you put on bright purple rags. 

And bask in the sun content and laugh-

They say you're gotten shiftless and 
lazy ; 

But O the unstrained wild honey ot

Chimed with the gold wheat fields and 
the pine trees and the sun.

EUROPE 
@ At the Conference at the Friends 
House in London on color prejudice 
in England, many facts were brought 
out. It is said that the larger hotels 
will receive colored people only if they 
are “personages” and take a suite of 
rooms at a high price. Colored medi- 
cal students in England, even British 
citizens, are debarred from _ hospital 
appointment simply because of color. 
All colored students in London have 
great difficulty in obtaining lodging; 
and the British Broadcasting Company 
uses the word “Nigger” frequently. 
@ The celebrated case of Dr. Know- 
les has been argued before the Privy 
Council of London. Knowles is a 
white man who was convicted and sen- 
tenced to death for murder of his 
wife in West Africa. As is usual, in 
many parts of British West Africa, 
there was no jury trial. To this, Ne- 
groes have long objected, but could get 
no hearing in democratic England until 
a white man got caught by the system. 
The Privy Council has decided to al- 
low Knowles to appeal his case. 
@ A temporary committee of Negro 
workers selected by the Anti-Imper- 
ialistic League is calling an Interna- 
tional Conference of Negro Workers 
July 1, 1930, in London. All labor 
organizations are invited. 
@ In the Scottish National Memorial 
te David Livingston at Blantyre, there 


February, 1930 


are a series of tableaus illustrating his 
great work in Africa. One of these, 
given by the London Anti-Slavery So- 
ciety and called ‘““Mercy”, we illustrate 
this month. 


@ The International Office for the 
Protection of Native Races, at Geneva, 
sends out a Report of its activities. It 
was founded by René Claparéde, who 
died in February, 1928. The president 
is Henri A. Junod. 


AMERICA 


@ According to the census, there 
were in 1920, 8,053,225 Negroes in 
the United States ten years of age and 
over. Of these, 1,842,161 or 22.9 per 
cent were illiterate. In 1910, the per- 
centage was 30.4, and before that, 
the official figures are as follows: In 
1900, 44.4 per cent; 1890, 57.1 per 
cent; 1880, 70 per cent; 1870, 79.9 
per cent. These figures are probably 
understatements of the actual facts: 
that is, it is doubtful if in 1920, 77 
per cent of the Negro population could 
actually read and write with any de- 
gree of accuracy. However, the fig- 
ures may be compared with figures of 
illiteracy in other parts of the world. 
Brazil, 64.9 per cent; Bulgaria, 46.7 
per cent; Dutch East Indies, 94.8 per 
cent; India, 90.5 per cent; Spain, 47.7 
per cent; France, 8.2 per cent; Bel- 
gium, 7.9 per cent. These figures are 
not all exactly comparable, but they 
show that the American Negro is far

from being the most ignorant of the 
races of the world. More than half 
the population of the following coun- 
tries are illiterate: Mexico, the Philip- 
pines, Porto Rico, Portugal and Vene-

tants of Egypt and nine-tenths of the 
South African natives can not read and 
write. 


@ Paul E. Baker, Secretary of the 
Harlem League, is sponsoring a second 
European trip in July and August, 
1930, at a cost of $600 or less. The 
excursionists will visit England, Bel- 
gium, Holland, Germany, Switzerland 
and France. ‘The Passion Play at 
Oberammergau will be visited on the 
trip and the Youth Conference in Ger- 
many. The number will be limited to 
25. 

@ Roland Hayes is making his Sixth 
concert tour of America with great 
success. The Chicago Tribune says 
that he “is singing better this season 
than ever before.” The Cincinnati 
Enquirer says: “When Roland Hayes 
sings, it is an event in the musical 
world.” The Philadelphia Record 
adds that: “Hayes has a remarkable 
voice; delicate, floating and withall in- 
tense.” Last summer, Mr. Hayes 
visited Sir George Henschel at his villa 
at Kensington, England. Sir George 
was the first Conductor of the Boston 
Symphony and London Symphony Or- 
chestras, and is a singer and teacher of 
renown. He is eighty years old.

Advancement of Colored People wired 
President Hoover indorsing his demand 
for a Commission to study conditions 
in Haiti; they concluded their tele- 
gram with these words: 

“What is needed in this case is a 
Commission of such character and ex- 
perience that it will seek the truth, 
get the facts, and not be afraid to tell 
all it finds. 

“Especially, Mr. President, twelve 
million American citizens of Negro 
descendent are deeply and vitally in- 
terested in this matter which touches 
their legitimate racial pride and the 
fate of over two million fellow black 
folk. They feel that they ought, in 
the interest of justice and truth, to be 
suitably represented on any Commis- 
sion which you may appoint.”

T. G. Nutter of Charleston, West 
Virginia, with honorable mention to 
Mrs. Daisy Lampkin of Pittsburgh 
and Mrs. R. L. Dougherty of Jamaica,

@ Mr. Nutter succeeded in winning 
two important legal victories for the 
colored people; the one preventing the 
public libraries of West Virginia from 
segregating or excluding Negroes, and 
the other nullifying the covenants and 
contracts of white property owners in 
which they had sought to restrict the 
sale of real estate by excluding colored 
people. Mr. Nutter is also the active 
President of one of the most active 
Branches of the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored Peo-

de Musique in Paris, and studied un- 
der Lucien Capet and Maurice Hoyot. 
He also pursued his studies in Hun- 
gary, under Sollaway and Hubay. It 
is the consensus of opinion that Jones 
is a remarkable violinist. The Prin- 
cess de Polignac writes that Mr. Jones 
“gave His Royal Highness, the Prince 
of Wales, and all of my guests, a musi- 
cal treat at my home last night. He 
is a marvelous violinist”. Count 
Speletti calls him “an artist of the 
first rank.”

dent of the Mechanics Bank of Rich- 
mond. He was notable in earlier 
years for his outspoken independence. 
@ The Southeastern Library Associa- 
tion at its meeting in Biloxi, Missis- 
sippi in 1928, passed a resolution in- 
dorsing library service to Negroes. 
Thereupon, the trustees of the Rosen- 
wald Fund decided to help public li- 
braries in the South. The plan of the 
Fund is to help a few county libraries 
which shall be demonstration centers. 
Grants have been made to five coun- 
ties already, two in North Carolina, 
two in Tennessee and one in Louisiana. 
These grants are under the following 
conditions: the county must house the 
work and employ trained librarians; 
equal service must be given to all peo- 
ple in the county, rural and urban, Ne- 
gro and white; within five years, the 
county must assume full responsibility 
for the libraries and maintain them on 
at least as high a plane as when the 
Fund gave help. The directors of the 
Hampton Library Schools at Hampton 
Institute and at Peabody College will 
inspect the libraries from time to time 
and give advice. 

@ Students from the Brick Junior 
College, who are colored, and the At- 
lantic Christian College, who are 
white, are studying race relations to- 
gether this year in North Carolina. 
They meet monthly. 

@ Reverend Richard Carroll, is dead 
at Columbia, South Carolina. He was 
born in South Carolina in 1859; edu- 
cated at Benedict and Shaw, and be- 
came a Baptist minister. He was the 
type of Negro conservative who is wel- 
come to Southern white people, but, 
at the same time, he was not without 
ideals for his own race and was a hard 
worker. 

@ Brick Junior College, N. C., has 
presented Hugh Black’s ‘Three 
Dreams” in the college chapel. The 
audience was drawn into the mood by 
the sextette from Lucia di Lammer- 
moor, and was asked to sit with closed 
eyes during the soft music between the 
readings. For the first dream, which 
pictures life without pain or shadows, 
theereader was dressed in a light blue 
robe against an orange background; 
and for the second dream, which pic- 
tures life as all pain and shadows, the 
reader was dressed in gray and laven- 
der against a black background. For 
the third dream, which pictures life 
with its joy and pain, its sunshine and 
shadows all harmonized by Love, the 
reader wore rich dark red against a 
background of old blue and gold. At 
the close, the audience sang, “O Little 
Town of Bethlehem.” The three 
readers were Lucy Faison, Violet Wall 
and Lovey Bullock.

Scouts have a room in the building, and 
over 1,500 persons regularly visit the 
place. Church services and Sunday 
School are held. There are industrial 
classes, play grounds, and home visit- 
ing. 


The Charles W. Baldwin Men’s Dormitory, 


@ James A. Bond of Kentucky, Dean 
of the Kentucky Normal and Indus- 
trial Institute, has been made Special- 
ist in Education and attached to the 
Bureau of Education of the U. S. De- 
partment of the Interior. Tempor- 
arily, he is stationed in Cincinnati, but 
later will serve in Washington. His 
first work will be to help in the survey 
of secondary education. Mr. Bond is 
38 years old and has taught in Ken- 
tucky and Tennessee. 

@ The following story is sent us: 
“A man by the name of Harvey Mit- 
chell was employed as an auto painter 
in a garage at Greenwood, Miss. and 
there worked along with him a white 
man. ‘Sometime at the close of the 
day’s work this white man went to 
Mitchell’s home and the two men 
drove out together in Mitchell’s car. 
Later Mitchell’s body was found near 
a place called Charleston, Mississippi; 
the white man with Mitchell's car has 
not up to this time been apprehended 
and it seems the local authorities are 
not trying in any way to apprehend 
Mitchell’s murderer.” 

@A letter from Atlanta, Georgia says: 
“Now is the time for the real truth 
to be told about Atlanta and if the 
N. A. A. C. P. would send its best 
man to make an investigation, and give 
the country a ‘look in’, much good 
could be done for the protection of the 
innocent Negroes who are being in- 
timidated. Our organizations have 
worked hard but they get only prom- 
ises. Atlanta is rotten from the 
Mayor down and an exposé is neces- 
sary and the widest publicity should 
be given it.”

in the Des Moines Tribune-Capital: 


We, the undersigned, publicly pledge 
for ourselves and respectfully urge upon 
others that a friendlier and more tol- 
erant attitude be cultivated among the 
races destined to live side by side in this 
community; that every individual be 
judged solely on the basis of individual 
character and conduct, irrespective of 
race, creed, or color; and that influenced 
by this standard alone, owners, proprie- 
tors and patrons more cheerfully grant 
to men, women and children of every 
color and nationality, the privileges now 
granted to those of their own race in 
all public places such as churches, thea- 
ters, eating houses, hotels, lecture halls, 
colleges and schools.

studying race psychology since 1917. 
He started with the idea that mentality 
varied with race and color, but he now 
asserts without qualification that there 
are no racial mental differences. What 
we find are mental differences due to 
selection and education. These con- 
clusions are based on_ psychological 
tests made on five thousand Indians, 
two thousand Mexicans, two thousand 
Negroes, one thousand two hundred 
Japanese, one thousand Philippinos, 
ac well as numbers of white people.

THE STORM 


HE air grows sultry 

Without its usual breeze— 
The long-expected downpour comes, 
The wind tears thru the trees, 
A clap of thunder shakes the earth 
With a rumbling, muttering sound, 
A streak of lightning flits above, 
Revealing the homeward bound. 
With a rending crash a limb falls down, 
Its leaves are blown about the ground, 
The hisstng rain in torrents beats 
Upon the homes of many streets 
While inmates are indeed alarmed 
Until the mighty storm is calmed. 
And then, alas, to end their strife 
A sunbeam sheds reviving life. 


ELIzABETH CarTER. Age 14. 


I think the Junior N. A. A. C. P. 
should have a page in THE CRrIsIs, be- 
cause it behooves every young person 
to read good literature, and what 
young person would not be eager to 
read a magazine knowing that his 
friends, acquaintances and club mem- 
bers have put something into it? Then, 
too, THE CRIsIs wants to become more 
widely read by young people, and the 
best way to have it widely read is to 
have a large number of contributors 
to its reading matter. Let people of

all ages and ideas have their part. This 
will, indeed, create within them a love 
and pride in THE Crisis. It will also 
make it possible for all members of the 
N. A. A. C. P. to study the work of 
all the other members, and for all to 
know what the work of the various 
branches really are, whether they are 
near or far. 


This will make the magazine more 
popular, which is of the greatest im- 
portance. Besides this, it will help the 
young people to develop an art of writ- 
ing and the habit of reading it much 
more regularly than they formerly did. 

The young people of today, are to be 
the adults of tomorrow, and in order 
to be successful in their tomorrow’s 
work, they must begin their prepara- 
tion today. 

Publishers of the biggest and most 
popular books, papers, and magazines 
of today have found that by having a 
group of young people make comments 
and have some active part it has been a 
boost to their publication. We all

want THE Crisis to be on the highest 
platform, ranked among the best. 
DorotHy EpNA Grey, 
Berkeley, Cal. 

This is my idea of how the Junior 
Crisis shall be conducted: 

Each division should have an asso- 
ciated editor, who would send in 
monthly the doings and activities of 
most interest. Junior photographs or 
short write-ups of Juniors obtaining 
honors in associations, churches, 
schools and community work should be 
reproduced and also the reproduction 
of drawings, paintings, and sketches 
that show promise as a stimulant in 
this line. Conduct series of essays, 
and contests of limited lengths to give 
expression too, and obtain impressions 
from Juniors. 


Aim: The aim of the Juniors is to 
promote the study and readings of Ne- 
gro Literature and writings of Negro 
life, so as to let the race people and 
other people know, that there are and 
have been Negroes of high standard, 
who have contributed and helped civ- 
ilization to be what it is. 

To stimulate growth and interest in 
the Junior work: By encouraging in- 
tensively and extensively the study of 
Negro History and Art, ancient and 
modern of their benefactors. 

Also, to encourage the observance of 
birthdays of noted Negroes and their 
friends of particular interest in the 
Negro History and give public exer- 
cises.

THE BRANCHES OF THE

OW is the N. A. A. C. P. sup- 

ported? ‘The answer is simple. 
It is supported by its Branches. These 
Branches are composed overwhelm- 
ingly of colored members, and in the 
last eleven years Robert Bagnall tells 
us that they have sent the sum of $402,- 
404.40 to the National Office.

This is splendid work, but it is not 
work with which we should be satis- 
fied. Rather, the present Branches 
and others still to be formed, should 
realize that an annual Budget of 
$100,000 is the least with which an 
Association like this can do effective 
work, 

The Association suffers from a lack 
of field work. For a long time, Mr. 
Bagnall and Mr. Pickens have borne 
the brunt of a nation-wide attempt to 
keep the National Office in touch with 
local bodies. Mrs. Lampkin is a much- 
needed addition; but no amount of in- 
spection from the Center can take the 
place of local vigor, alert and active 
workers, and a new and wider pro- 
gram of social reform. 


THAT CAPITAL “N” 


HE Raleigh, North Carolina 

Times tells Antonio M. Roper, 
a student at St. Augustine’s College, 
that it will not capitalize “Negro” 
because it does not capitalize “white.” 
This logic is beneath contempt. The 
word corresponding to “white” is 
“black” or “colored”, while the words 
corresponding to Negro are Caucasian, 
Mongolian, Nordic, Indian, Jewish, 
European, African, American, and 
similar words referring to great groups 
of people. This, of course, will not 
influence the Editor of the Raleigh 
Times. He spells it “negro,” because 
that is the way he thinks.

ILLITERACY 


R. M. L. BRITTAIN, the Pres- 

ident of the Georgia Institute 
of Technology, tells us why Georgia 
“ranks low among the states in the 
matter of illiteracy.” These reasons 
are: 

1. Poverty, dating from the Civil 
War. 

2. Because the white people of 
Georgia are obliged to educate, “not 
only their own children, but the chil- 
dren of Negroes.” 

3. The small amount of wealth, per 
child. 

This reasoning is astonishing. In 
the first place, if Georgia is poor to- 
day, it is not because of what hap- 
pened sixty-five years ago. And sec- 
ondly, if the white people of Georgia 
have the “burden” of educating Ne- 
gro children, the Negroes, man, wo- 
man and child, have the “burden” of 
doing most of the work of Georgia 
for wages which would put anybody 
but the Brittains of the world to 
shame. 


GRUNDY, HEFLIN, VARE AND 
COMPANY 


E can not restrain our delight 

at the refusal of a seat to Sena- 
tor Vare by the United States Senate. 
We have no brief for Mr. Vare. We 
know the man and his methods. But 
to have him put out by Mr. Heflin 
and succeeded by Mr. Grundy, fills us 
with inextinguishable laughter. 

We quote the Philadelphia Evening 
Ledger with deep and abiding sym- 
pathy: 

“What now? If this sort of censor- 
ship is to persist, what may become of 
the Southern Democratic Senators 
who get to Washington only because 
their States ruthlessly and even vio- 
lently deny the simplest constitutional 
rights of fifty per cent of the people 


who live in them?” 


SMUTS 
AN SMUTS, former Prime Minis- 
ter of the Union of South Africa, 
has been traveling in England and is 
now in the United States. He is a 
man whom many regard as a 2reat in- 


ternational statesman, but for us Amer- 
ican Negroes, he has one intolerable 
defect which we more clearly than 
other peoples can see will forever keep 
him from true greatness. 


He was born and trained into the 
ingrained prejudice of the white South 
African against black folk. His whole 
conception of the world is that of a 
world not necessarily composed entire- 
ly of white people, but certainly or- 
ganized, directed and established for 
white people. When he says that he 
wants white civilization to triumph in 
Africa, he does not mean simply that 
he wants civilization to triumph, it 
must be civilization owned by white - 
people. The black people must share it 
only insofar as they cater to white peo- 
ples wants and even whims. Smuts is 
not so provincial as Hertzog. He does 
not want to face the conscience of the 
world with actual laws to keep Negroes 
from being artisans or from any real 
economic or political rights, or from 
any social status. But he wants to ac- 
complish exactly the same thing that 
Hertzog wants to accomplish: that is, 
to put the black man back “in his 
place’ and to keep him there. Beyond 
this, none of the liberalism of Jan 
Smuts has ever been able to stir a 
single step. 

Is this judgment unfair? Does it 
seem harsh when compared with what 
Mr. muts says in America? If it 
does, remember that in the Union of 
South Africa, nine-tenths of the na- 
tives are illiterate because of lack of 
school facilities; that taxation without 
representation is the rule in their poli- 
tical life, and that even in the one 
province where they have the right to 
vote, they can not vote for a Negro 
represenative; social ostracism extends 
to excluding them from white churches, 
from getting mail at the same Post 
Office window, and often from walking 
on the sidewalks. They must carry 
passes when they travel; they ride in 
Jim Crow cars; they are kept by law 
from pursuing most of the profitable 
lines of work; they can not buy land, 
save in a few restricted areas; and 
against all this zenith of race dicrim- 
ination, Jan Smuts, as Prime Min- 
ister and leading statesman, has raised 
no effective voice and merely calis them 
patient asses.

ABOUT WAILING 
EORGE JEAN NATHAN last 


fall told the readers of the 
American Mercury reasons that made 
him tired of wails from Negroes. His 
argument was that lynching has de- 
creased; that a Negro can live his pri- 
vate life as he pleases; that he has free- 
dom in sex, gambling and drinking; 
that he plays on college athletic teams; 
that he acts on the stage; intermarries 
sometimes with whites ; sings ; publishes 
recognized books; has big churches; 
holds public office; shines in the prize 
ring and at the Bar; is entering the 
movies; owns land and property; has 
an increasing number of colleges and 
college students and less illiteracy ; sees 
the whites getting glory from featur- 
ing him; and commits fewer suicides 
than other folk. 

All this is encouraging but it is more 
encouraging to Mr. Nathan than it is 
to us. As showing progress, it is as- 
tonishing; as absolute accomplishment 
and reasonable goal-reaching, it is noth- 
ing to be satisfied about. 

We see the other side of the shield. 
We persist in wailing because in 1929 
eight Negroes unconvicted of crime 
by any civilized method, were killed 
and tortured by mobs. We wail be- 
cause our children are growing up in 
ignorance because of discrimination 
and deliberate perversion of public 
school funds. We wail at being ex- 
cluded from public institutions, like 
libraries, hospitals and parks. We 
shriek at taxation without representa- 
tion, and the disfranchisement of nine- 
tenths of all Negroes living in the 
South, and of four-fifths of Negroes 
with education and property; at a sys- 
tem of fraud and force which distorts 
the whole basis of democratic repre- 
sentation throughout the United States 
and makes Blease and Heflin our rep- 
resentatives in Congress. We are not 
satisfied with the present condition of 
Negro actors and writers. They may, 
to be sure, entertain Mr. Nathan and 
other white folk with exhibitions of 
crude comedy, rude debauchery and 
sadism; but we conceive Art to be a 
reflection of life as it is among us and 
not life as white people conceive it. 
The every-day truth about the mass 
of Negro workers is not today writ- 
ten or permitted to be written. We 
wail because in so many cases where 
colored people show ability they are 
silently or openly discriminated 
against,—kept out of colleges; refused 
chances for research in laboratories; 
put out of their place as tennis players, 
jockeys and baseball players. We wail 
because the daily newspapers of the 
United States and the radio corpora- 
tions refuse by intricate but effective 
means to let black singers and orators 
have a place in national competition. 


64 


Our chance for higher training is not 
one-fourth of what it should be, and 
seems so large to Mr. Nathan simply 
because it was once so pitifully small. 
We own property, but if we had half 
the property that we have been de- 
liberately cheated out of, we could se- 
cure a startling increase of respect 
from Mr. Nathan and other magazine 
writers. We work harder than any 
other class of Americans and we are 
paid miserably less than a decent liv- 
ing wage. We are the victims of pov- 
erty, malnutrition and disease to an ex- 
tent that surpasses every other group 
in America, and for this reason we are 
crowded, pushed and kicked into the 
jails, and insane asylums. 

We are not unmindful of our ac- 
complishments and of a significant 
change in American public opinion. 
But we know perfectly well that all 
that we have accomplished is to put 
our feet upon the path to modern man- 
hood. We are still the only group in 
civilized American life who can be 
openly and grossly insulted on the pub- 
lic platform and in newspaper edi- 
torials and columns without any effec- 
tive chance to protest to a sound pub- 
lic opinion; but our encouragement 
comes from the fact that two genera- 
tions ago we could be openly mur- 
dered upon the streets of New York 
with even less protest. This is prog- 
ress. We are encouraged. But even 
with this before our faces, and with 
every respect to the American Mer- 
cury, Wwe are not going to change our 
wailing to grinning just yet. 

In fact, we have a feeling that in 
times past we have already rather over- 
done that grinning business. Let’s 
wail a while. 


TENNIS 

HERE is one subtle glow of tri- 

umph among all Negroes who 
read that Gerald L. Norman, Jr., Cap- 
tain of the Flushing, New York, High 
School Tennis Team, and Reginald 
Weir, of the Tennis Team of the Col- 
lege of the City of New York, have 
not been allowed to compete in the 
National Junior Indoor Tennis 
Tournament of the United States 
Lawn Tennis Association. Every Ne- 
gro knows that the reason for this re- 
fusal is that these young men are of 
championship material. They were 
bound to win, and the white players 
of lawn tennis were afraid to be beaten 
by colored boys. This is Nordic su- 
periority with a vengeance, and it is 
the kind of thing that is becoming 
more and more common in the United 
States. There was a time when they 
kicked and kept us out because they 
said and believed we had no ability of 





brain or trained brawn. We haven't 
changed all that yet, but we are mak. 
ing rapid progress. 


ATLANTA UNIIERSITY 
T is a pleasure to know that, de- 
spite unpleasant and _ irresponsible 
rumours, none of the old teachers who 
gave their lives to Atlanta University 
have been dismissed without adequate 
compensation: One of the first ques- 
tions considered when the merger 
was discussed was protection for 
teachers who had for years devotedly 
given their service to Atlanta Univer- 
sity. Twelve names were recom- 
mended for retiring allowances. These 
allowances were voted and are still in 
effect. They include Dr. Adams, Mr. 
Webster, Miss Swift, Mrs. Howe, 
Miss Hancock, and many others well- 

known to former students of A. U. 


INTERRACIAL LOVE IN 
TEXAS 

HE Houston, Texas Post-Dis- 

patch says in a recent editorial: 

In announcing the annual convention 
of the Texas Commission on Inter-racial 
Co-operation in Dallas for Novem- 
ber 1-2, Dr. R. M. Woods, instructor 
in sociology in Sam Houston State 
Teachers’ college at Huntsville, director 
of the commission in this State, makes 
it clear that attainment of social equality 
between the races is not the aim of the 
organization. Friendliness between the 
white and colored people is promoted, 
but there is no thought of bringing them 
together on an equal social plane, he 
states. 

With this aim of the commission 
thoroughly understood, the commission 
should attract the interest and support 
of the white people generally and of the 
more intelligent and better element of 
the colored people throughout the State. 

All of which is interesting nonsense. 
How are these folks going to meet to- 
gether without social equality? Are 
they going to refuse to speak to each 
other? Can they shake hands? Would 
a cup of tea and a biscuit overthrow 
the universe? Is there any chance for 
sympathetic friendship? May not 
some of them fall in love and get mar- 
ried? And if any of these things, 
where is the line going to be drawn? 

What is the use of people talking 
like idiots just because they are try- 
ing to solve a human problem? The 
inter-racial movement in Texas is g0- 
ing to follow the same lines as human 
contacts the world over. If the move- 
ment is successful, white people and 
black people are going to get ac- 
quainted with each other. If this 
acquaintanceship and understanding 
increases, so will their social inter- 
mingling increase. And nothing that

EDUCATION 


UPPOSE that a Congressman is in- 
s terested in the American Negro, 
realizing that the oppression of any 


group of twelve million people in 


America is dangerous to the whole 
country. Suppose he wants to do some- 


thing to help the Negroes? What 
would be the most obvious thing that 
he could do? 

He might think of disfranchisement 
in the South; he might think of /ynch- 
ing, but he certainly would have to 
think of education. In education, the 
American Negro has suffered the most 
vital and damaging and inexcusable 
discrimination. He was forced by law 
to be illiterate until Emancipation ; and 
since then the public schools of the 
South have proceeded to distribute pub- 
lic taxation so that, for instance, in 
Georgia, where the Negroes form 43 
per cent of the population, they get but 
9 per cent of the school funds; while 
$36.29 is expended for each white 
child a year, only $4.59 is expended 
for each colored child. In Mississippi, 
in many counties where the Negro 
forms three-fourths of the population, 
less than a $1.00 a year per child is 
spent on Negro education. In Tunica 
County, white children receive $63 a 
year for education and Negroes $4.40. 
In South Carolina, where a majority 
of the inhabitants are Negroes, the 
state spent, 1925-26, $14,673,719, for 
white schools, and $1,655,652 for Ne- 
gro schools, 

This indicates a discrimination so 
fundamental and so calculated to per- 
petuate ignorance, crime, prejudice, 
poverty and disease, that any member of 
Congress who wishes to save his coun- 
try might well begin by advocating the 
appropriation of United States funds 
to the various states on the basis of 
illiteracy with the proviso that there 
should be in its expenditure absolutely 
no discrimination between the races. 
If any member of Congress asks for the 
votes of American Negroes, they should 
ask him what his record has been on 
national aid to education without dis- 
crimination as to race. If he replies 
by saying that he supported the appro- 
priations of Land Grant Funds, or the 
Smith-Hughes or the Smith-Lever 
Bills, ask him if in these appropria- 
tions of public funds for agricultural 
and technical education, he.saw to it 
that no discrimination between races 
was to be allowed. As a matter of 
fact, the discrimination in the adminis- 
tration of these public funds against 
Negroes is open and notorious. 


February , 1930 





THE DEPARTMENT OF THE 
INTERIOR 


OR a second time, we have been 

having experiences with the De- 
partment of the Interior. November 
16, Secretary Wilbur, with the ap- 
proval of President Hoover, an- 
nounced the appointment of twenty- 
three ‘distinguished authorities” as 
members of an Advisory Committee 
on National Illiteracy. The name of 
no single colored person appeared. 
Diligent inquiry finally brought in- 
formation from the Commissioner of 
Education, explaining as a reason why 
no Negro was appointed: 

“The conference called by the Secre- 
tary of the Interior on Saturday next 
consists very largely of individuals who 
have been engaged in illiterary cru- 
sades more or less as a private ven- 
ture.” 

This made me a little warm, and 
| wrote: 

“Will you permit me to say by way 
of commentary that if there are any 
people in the United States who have 
been more consistently and continu- 
ously, both as individuals and as a 
group engaged in illiteracy crusades, 
than American Negroes, I should be 
very much interested to know their 
names and race. It seems to me little 
less than outrageous that a Confer- 
ence on Illiteracy will omit represen- 
tatives of the most illiterate group in 
the United States; the group for whom 
illiteracy was for two centuries com- 
pulsory, and a group which by its own 
efforts, as well as the efforts of friends, 
has done more to reduce its illiteracy 
than any similar group in the world in 
the same length of time.” 


The Commissioner was “amazed” 
at this letter. But. nevertheless, be- 
fore the record of his amazement 


reached me, the name of Benjamine F. 
Hubert, colored President of the 
Georgia State Industrial College. had 
been added to the “distinguished au- 
thorities” aforesaid. 

We also note with interest that 
when Secretary Wilbur appointed an 
Advisory Committee for the survey of 
Secondary Education, the Negro race 
was represented by John M. Gandy, 
President of Virginia Normal and In- 
dustrial Institute. It would seem that 
while the presence of twelve million 
Negroes in the United States was ap- 
parently unknown when Mr. Wilbur 
took office, that the fact is gradually 
dawning on his consciousness. 


MY PICTURE DID NOT 
APPEAR 
T is a bit disconcerting at times to 


find yourself vanked down from 
some pinacle of endeavor to a realiza- 





tion that what your companion, your 
co-worker and your friend was think- 
ing of was not the Emancipation of the 
Colored Race, or the Rise of Woman, 
or the Right to Vote for a fair-minded 
member of the Board of Education— 
No, what he, she or it wanted was 
personal mention in the columns of 
your paper and a picture with a suit- 
ably long inscription! 

I am sure that the appetite for rea- 
sonable and honest praise has its legiti- 
mate place in the world. I like praise 
myself when I know I deserve it. But 
I am continually astonished at the 
number of people whom I find who 
seem to consider that personal men- 
tion is the main object of their ex- 
istence. Their lust for publicity is 
sickening. It seems to be the center 
and end of their living. They will 
work and work like the devil but only 
if they hear some approaching fan-fare 
of trumpets for themselves. With this 
main object, they are quite willing to 
carry on as side lines efforts to uplift 
humanity. But the main person for 
whom they are working and the only 
humanity in which they are really in- 
terested, indeed, the only object which 
calls for their whole soul and enthu- 
siasm, is themselves. 

The bad thing about these people is 
that they are missing so much. Fine 
and meritorjous as they are, or think 
they are, a little thought and reading 
and consideration would, I am sure, 
convince them that there are in the 
world any number of persons and ob- 
jects just as interesting and even more 
so. Even if they are not convinced of 
this, there is a great truth in the word 
of the Master, intimating that he who 
loses his life in a great cause may event- 


ually find it. 

All of which is preliminary to say- 
ing: 

Tue Crisis does not exist merely 
for furnishing personal publicity to en- 
terprising and pushing people who 
think they deserve it. It exists to work 
for the uplift of twelve million Ameri- 
can citizens; and if in the storm and 
stress of this work your picture is omit- 
ted, and your effort forgotten or un- 
known, forgive us and agree with us 
that the omission is small, compared 
with the great end we all seek. 


On the other hand, any magazine 
recognizes as a central part of its duty, 
the discovering and exploitation of suc- 
cessful human endeavor. But there are 
three ways of approaching this: We 
may give publicity: 1. To those whom 
the public likes to hear about; 2. to 
those it ought to hear about; 3. to those 
who want to be heard about. 


If it caters to the first, the Editor 
becomes sensational and even nasty, 
sinking inevitably to the depths of 


65 


transient public taste and featuring 
criminals and degenerates by the side 
of real desert and with equal if not 
greater éclat. 

If it publishes news and pictures of 
those who seek and insist on publicity, 
(and their name, dear God, is legion!) 
it surrenders all real standards of judg- 
ment and fills its pages with those who 
pay most either in cash or influence. 

Self assertion, self adventure, self 
realism, can all be understood and justi- 
fied so long as the end is infinitely more 
than Self—as much more as the world’s 
billions of selves are more than one 
Self. But, the meanness that seeks to 
filter the universe through one narrow 
me; that makes my magnification the 
manipulated and coerced end of all be- 
ing, is indefensible. 

I count my Soul too great to make 
itself its only object. 

To discover the worthy and praise 
them with restraint and truth; to set 
before one’s readers real triumphs of 
hard work and trained ability, is a most 
difficult task; such workers are modest 
and often will not be photographed or 
answer letters. They have a fine and 
wholesome contempt for mere applause. 
And even when they feel their success 
and dessert, they shrink from blowing 
their own trumpets even gently. Their 
friends and admirers are often neglect- 
ful and forgetful and so some of our 
finest characters and best workers re- 
main obscure and unknown. 

For twenty years, THE Crisis has 
striven desperately to discover and set 
before its readers such true leaders and 
workers, but our success has been but 
indifferent. 

On the other hand, and probably be- 
cause we are a young and neglected 
race, the appetite for publicity of any 
sort, the fierce envies and jealousies 
evoked for the slightest cause, is a con- 
tinual matter of the most dishearten- 
ing astonishment and shame to a con- 
scientious colored Editor. 

Shrieks and anathemas descend upon 
his unprotected head: “I won’t work 
for your organization any more!” cries 
one. But it is not my organization. 
“Why did you give him three inches 
and me only two?” Why, indeed un- 
less I had an unexpected inch of space. 
“Why did you mention Dr. Smith and 
say no word of Dr. Jones?” But, I 
never heard of Dr. Jones. Who does 
he happen to be? And so on. 

Of course, it is not solely a “colored” 
problem. It is American. It is demo- 
cratic. One of the acute failures of 
modern democracy is the apparent ne- 
cessity of obviously and blatantly cam- 
paigning for office. To all finer na- 
tures, the thing is revolting. Fancy 
standing up to say: “I want to be Sena- 
tor and I’ll make a good one!” How 
do I know I will? I don’t know. In 
fact, I probably know I won’t. And 


66 


thus, the Senate is filled with the sort 
of man who can stand and offer him- 
self naked to millions. Men not prin- 
ciples thus becomes the slogan of our 
democracy. 

But you and I must go back to prin- 
ciples. We must go back to the selfless 
striving for ideals. Do not think of 
THE Crisis simply as a means of boost- 
ing me and you to our friends; think 
of it as a great educator of a people and 
exponent of a human cause. The up- 
lift of the Negro race and all humanity 
with it is the object of THE Crisis and 
not the advertisement of Jim Smith. 

And perhaps that’s why your picture 
failed to appear. 


PROVINCIALISM 


N the course of making an intensive 

research of all the material avail- 
able on the subject of Langston 
Hughes, and the Modern Negro last 
term, I came across the Crisis. Since 
then, I have been following it up close- 
ly, perhaps because it is one of the few 
magazines of the Negro available at 
the Public libraries. 

I, you must know, am a girl and a 
white girl. This is meant only as an 
introduction to what I am sincerely 
interested in. 

In the Postscript, this month, you 
answer the absurd, if pitiful, child 
Roland A. Barton and, in answering 
you say :— 

“Would you be any less ashamed of 
being descended from a black man, 
or would your schoolmates feel any 
less superior to you.” 

It is about that I am writing. You 
continue and say: “Your real work 
as a Negro lies in two directions: 
First, to let the world know what 
there is fine and genuine about the 
Negro race.” 

Right. But here is where I want 
to challenge. Some place in my re- 
search I came across—I am sorry I 
have not my essay with me else I would 
quote directly—an article by a boy 
whom I admire and respect greatly, 
Langston Hughes, whom I intend to 
meet some day. In it he said as nearly 
as I remember: , 

“We build our [castles] as firmly 
as we know how. (Talking of the 
younger Negro attempts). If the 
Negro is pleased, we are glad; if they 
are not, it doesn’t matter either.” 

At the time the challenge made my 
being quiver in sympathetic accord but 
now—now I question this isolation 
and selfish retainment of the new gos- 
pel. And that is why I write to you. 

I have a friend, a young Negro girl, 
who is race conscious and ignorant, 
horribly so, of all her race is doing. 
I am her good friend and she is mine 
but the gap of color is so strong, due 
to her desire to forget her race and 


become different, that I have but once 
in the many months I have known her 
been able to break the shell of her reti- 
cence (spell it as you will) and then 
only because of my fury at her bland 
ignorance of the existence of Countée 
Cullen. 

I don’t want you to think that she 
is stupid. She isn’t. She’s fine—fine 
clear through, with much ability. But 
she must be taken in hand. People 
wiser than she or I, people unpreju- 
diced and sympathetic must “‘patron- 
ize” her. 

You see she is leaving school, train- 
ing school, and may do anything at all. 
“Travel,” she says vaguely., 

It’s all wrong. She must not be 
permitted to become nothing. I am 
not a sentimentalist, not at all irra- 
tional either. She must meet new peo- 
ple, people who have done something. 
Her friends are negligible, negative. 
She realizes it, and is discouraged. 
You must help her. See her, talk to 
her. She knows nothing of this, so 
you can with a fine bravado drop this. 
But I challenge your statement. Work 
is being done. Groups are being 
formed. I know nothing of these. 
She knows less than I. 

You must help her. 


RED CROSS 
RINTING must be very slow in 
Washington. In the spring of 
1927, the N. A. A. C. P. complained 
of discrimination by Red Cross relief 
agencies in the Mississippi flood relief. 
This was emphatically denied. Then, 
President Hoover appointed a colored 
Committee. The Report of the col- 
ored Committee justified the criticisms 
of the N. A. A. C. P. in every im- 
portant respect. They reported on 
numerous and open discriminations in 
relief work. The Red Cross, as usual, 
passed the “‘buck” and blamed every- 
body but themselves. The colored 
Committee, under the chairmanship 
of R. R. Moton, and with the co-oper- 
ation of Bishop Jones, A. L. Holsey, 
J. S. Clarke, E. S. Jones, J. O. Thom- 
as, Mrs. John Hope, Miss Eva 
Bowles, C. A. Barnett, R. C. Brown, 
Miss M. FE. Williams, R. R. Taylor, 
Dr. L. M. McCoy, Dr. J. B. Mar- 
tin, B. M. Roddy, S. D. Redmond, 
T. M. Campbell, worked hard and 
faithfully, from June ,1927, to April, 
1928. Their Report carefully ar- 
arranged and toned down and pre- 
pared for the consumption of the pub- 
lic by persons in authority in Wash- 
ington has finally seen the light at the 
end of 1929. 

This is a good deal better than 
nothing. But it is too bad that this 
Committee could not have been the

Exploitation or Co-operation 
(Continued from page 49) 


b. Negro Business League 
c. Consumers’ Co-operative 
League of America. 


Conclusion 
Blind Drifting or Intelligent Planning 


T is the opinion of the writer that 

the Negro is faced with two alterna- 
tives: continued exploitation in the 
present economic order; or economic 
and industrial opportunity through an 
ever widening co-operative society of 
the Negroes’ own making. ‘The latter 
means four main forms of co-operation: 
(1) Consumers’ co-operation; (2) 
producers’ co-operation; (3) co-opera- 
tive credit, which means the advantages 
ot collective capital; (4) Distributors’ 
co-operation. 

This economic adjustment involves a 
technique of inquiry, research, experi- 
mentation, analysis, inference, testing, 
and verification. Naturally upon the 
Negro leaders falls the task of promot- 
ing and executing the program. 

The need is so urgent and the actual 
achievements of co-operation so real 
that those who grasp the principles of 
co-operation can hardly withhold their 
effort. 


Inter-marriage 
(Continued from page 50) 


the reverse holds true) to a position so 
horribly invidious, and exclaim “I love 
you” at the same time? This young 
man and woman propose to ignore So- 
ciety and live for themselves. Impos- 
sible. As eternal as the hills is the 
dictum, Man cannot live alone. Yet 
they deserve great credit for daring to 
face discussion. In the millennium 
there will be no obstacle to their mar- 
riage before Man: before God there 
never has been: but this is not 
the millennium. You must, each of 
you find within your own race or group 
(call it whatever you will) one who 
can place you in the light of Society’s 
benign approval—and keep you there, 
secure in the most exalted earthly hap- 
piness. Finally, it is only fair to say 
that while it is true the above opinions 
are merely those of one man, yet they 
should be regarded with deep sincerity, 
as they are expressed, because they 
were formed under experiences just a 
trifle out of the ordinary, extending 
over my lifetime. 


A Colored Man of New York. 


N. A. A. C. P. 
(Continued from page 52) 
And interest in the struggles was lit- 


F ebruary, 1930 


erally world-wide, newspapers in In- 
dia, Africa and the Far East, as well 
as in Canada and Europe, publishing 
detailed accounts of their progress. 


For the future then, these victories 
before public opinion are happy omens. 
They demonstrate that there is a body 
of citizens, large and ready to speak 
out, who will no longer tolerate gross 
discrimination and insult. It needs 
only to put the case of the Negro be- 
fore them and they will and do 
respond. 


In the field of the law and legal de- 
fense of the Negro’s civil rights, the 
Association has advanced its standards. 
One of the important victories won 
during the year, in Huntington, West 
Virginia, constitutes a direct and dam- 
aging blow at residential segregation 
by covenant among white property 
owners. And the entire issue of resi- 
dential segregation as well as that of 
the vote, was contested on a wide 
front, cases being undertaken in Rich- 
mond, Virginia; Washington, D. C.; 
and Columbus, Ohio, besides the vic- 
torious contest in Huntington. Con- 
tests against the white primary system, 
by which state committees seek to bar 
Negroes from the primary elections, 
were undertaken in no less than four 
states, Virginia, Florida, Texas and 
Arkansas. 

A mere list and brief description of 
some of the legal cases undertaken 
during the year gives an idea of the 
variety of serious problems the N. A. 
A. C. P, is constantly being called 
upon to face. For example: In Dayton, 
Ohio, Roy Freeman, convicted of mur- 
dering a police officer, was acquitted 
on second trial; conviction in Virginia 
of Thomas Nelson, on a charge of first 
degree murder, was set aside on appeal, 
by the State Supreme Court; in South 
Carolina, Ben Bess, who had served 
fourteen years of a thirty-year sen- 
tence on a white woman’s perjured 
testimony, was freed; in Arkansas, 
where two boys, Robert Bell and 
Grady Swain had been sentenced to be 
hanged, conviction of one of them was 
set aside by the State Supreme Court 
and on second trial he was sentenced to 
life imprisonment, with appeal again 
taken; in Brooklyn, where a young 
Lincoln University student had been 
shot by a police officer wearing civilian 
clothes, the N.A.A.C.P. procured dis- 
missal of the case against the boy and 
his companion and pressed charges 
against the police officer; in Gary, In- 
diana, a protracted legal struggle is 
being waged to prevent segregation of 
colored high school students; in Ten- 
nessee, Turley Wright, young colored 
man convicted on perjured testimony, 
of assault on an aged white woman, 
has been freed; in Kansas City, one of 
a group who committed an assault

upon A. L. Totten, representative of 
the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Por- 
ters, has been sentenced to prison; in 
Boston, a colored girl whom it had 
been sought to exclude, was admitted 
to the Sargent School of Physical 
Training; in Louisiana, two white men 
were sentenced to life imprisonment 
for wanton and unprovoked murder of 
two colored women; in Oklahoma, ap- 
peal has been taken from the sentence 
to life imprisonment imposed on Ed- 
ward Glass for the alleged murder of 
a white police officer; in Wisconsin an 
anti-intermarriage bill has been killed. 

This is only a skeleton outline of a 
few of the cases which have come to 
the N.A.A.C.P. during the year. 
Many of them involve the defense and 
release of people who would otherwise 
have been executed or would be un- 
justly imprisoned for life. The cases 
involve prompt action, contacts with 
attorneys white and colored in all parts 
of the United States, careful delibera- 
tion by the National Legal Committee 
in New York, and often a considerable 
expenditure of funds on necessary legal 
expenses. Even so, what the N.A.A. 
C.P. spends on all its legal’ work is not 
as much, by far, as a single case often 
costs other individuals or organizations. 

In the legal work of the Association, 
as has often been stressed, two con- 
siderations are paramount. First, the 
case must be one clearly involving 
discrimination because of color. Second, 
it should establish some general prin- 
cipal vital to the citizenship of colored 
people. With these two guiding lines 
the cases undertaken by the N.A.A. 
C.P. and its branches are chosen. But 
it is becoming ever more and more 
clear, that the amount of legal work 
the Association could do and ought to 
do if it were adequately supplied with 
funds, is simply immense. And no 
work could possibly be more valuable 
in safeguarding for the colored chil- 
dren of America the democracy in 
which they are to live. The result of 
successful legal contests is not merely 
the righting of injustice to individuals 
and to their race. Notice is thereby 
served on all people that the rights of 
Negroes cannot be violated with im- 
punity. And, in such cases as the con- 
viction of Louisiana white men for 
murdering colored women, that object 
lesson was demonstrated in the heart 
of the South in a section where the 
rights of Negroes even to their lives 
had been least respected. 

Meanwhile, both among liberal and 
intelligent white men in the South 
and in literary, theatrical, and musical 
circles in the North, reaching an ever 
increasing audience, the Association is 
cementing friendships. The _ benefit 
concert given early in December at 
the Forrest Theatre was a striking

event, one unique in the Association’s 
history. ‘Talented performers, ““‘head- 
liners’ on Broadway, white and col- 
ored stars of the most popular stage 
and screen successes, turned out cheer- 
fully to give their services ; and the 
audience was such that the Associated 
Press correspondent sent out to the 
newspapers of the entire country a 
brief comment on the affair in the so- 
ciety news. This society news com- 
ment was published in southern dailies 
as well as in newspapers from Maine 
to the Pacific Coast. 


All this work, of legal battle, of ° 


hammering away at the press of the 
civilized world, of lecturing before 
schools, colleges, in the Far South as 
well as in the North and West, of 
keeping the problem of decent race re- 
lations between white and_ colored 
Americans before the conscience of the 
entire country, is having its effect here 
and abroad. Every year adds to the 
impressive list of victories. And 1929 
in this respect has been a banner year. 

There is room for confidence and 
hope in what the Association is doing. 
What it does in the future depends 
very largely upon the branches and 
membership of the Association. On 
them the N.A.A.C.P. depends for sup- 
port. And on their support, depends 
in part the continuance of the impres- 
sive progress which can be recorded 
for colored Americans. 


Along the Color Line 


(Continued from page 61) 


@ The Ninth Anniversary of the 
accession of Alake Ademola II of 
Abeokuta, Nigeria, British West 


Africa, has been celebrated. 

@ Professor Ernest Schwarz, a white 
British South African, is dead in Sene- 
gal. He was a student of African 
geology and an advocate of irrigation, 


especially in the Kalahari Desert. 
His last journal says of Senegal: 
We landed yesterday in a_ blazing 


heat—this is the real Senegal, Dakar, 
the capital of the whole of French West 
Africa, which includes Mauretania with 
its Berbers, the River Senegal, with the 
Fulahs, right up to Timbuctoo. The 
inhabitants are very different from the 
Kaffirs; they wear very wide, loose 
cotton clothes—the richer ones making 
themselves into perfect balloons. Certain 
tribes wear white, others blue; others 
again, black. The women are marvel- 
lously got up, with tiny ringlets, lace 
robes as voluminous as those of the men, 
and great silver anklets, or golden shoes. 
‘ere are practically no Arabs—this is 
Negroland, but the Negroes are con- 
scious that not so very long ago they 
ad great empires that fought the white 
man successfully. 


¢ African laborers employed by an 
English Trading Company in Gambia, 
British West Africa, went on a strike 


February, 1930 


in November. There was some vio- 
lence, and police and troops were used. 
The strikers returned to work after 
their demand for an increase of 25 
per cent in their wages had been 
granted and they retained the right to 
membership in their trade union. 


@ There has been rioting in South 
East Nigeria, British West Africa, 
with the strange result that 43 black 
women and one black man, and appar- 
ently no white officials or soldiers have 
been killed. Most of the casualties 
took place December 11 at Opobo. 
The victims died by drowning and 
gunshot wounds. The Associated 
Press is ‘‘not able to learn the exact 
cause of the riots’’! 


EAST AFRICA 
@ The Moslem University of Al- 
Azhar in Cairo, is to be reconstituted 
along modern lines and teach foreign 
languages and modern science. 
@ Traveling supervising teachers of 
the Jeanes type are being used in many 
parts of East Africa and Rhodesia. 
@ The Portuguese Government is de- 
termined to stop compulsory native la- 
bor at Mozambique except for govern- 
ment work. The local farmers are 
protesting bitterly. 
@ An Exhibition is being held at Dar- 
es-Salaam, Tanganyika, East Africa. 
It consists of African handicrafts and 
Asiatic imports. Natives in white, In- 
dians in colors, Arabian sheiks and 
white Europeans are attending in 
large numbers. There are 3,000 ex- 
hibits sent by 700 exhibitors. 
@ The re-organization of the educa- 
tion of natives in East Africa is being 
considered in London. English and 
vernacular languages will be taught. 
“The demand of Africans for educa- 
tion is the most striking feature in 
Kenya today.” 


SOUTH AFRICA 


@ The police recently raided the na- 
tive quarters at Durban, South Africa 
and arrested 350 persons. They car- 
ried bayonets and machine guns and 
searched 5,000 natives. All this is 


supposed to be a move against black 
Communism. 


@ Gradually, in South Africa, it 
looks as though the color bar in the 
trade unions is being broken down. 
Lately, the South African Typograph- 
ical Union has admitted Indians as 
members. The President of the Union 
favored “a course which of necessity 
will lead to the admission of black and 
colored workers in all trades, and... 
white boys and girls, at least, in the 
printing industry, will soon have to 
learn their trade under black work- 


ers.”

occasion of calling to the attention of 
the public the wretched framework of 
the Red Cross; its figurehead officers, 
and its local organizations, arranged 
without democratic control, and, in the 
South, with the persistent disfranchise- 
ment of colored citizens who are kept 
from joining the Red Cross organiza- 
tion or from having any voice in its 
activities, except to contribute their 
hard-earned cash. 


From Housecleaner 
(Continued from page 53) 
these was the question of adequate 
housing. When the World War had 
ended, wages came down, but rents re- 
mained the same. The difficult ques- 
tion was to provide places for colored 
people to live at a fair and reasonable 
rental. Mr. Cook knew this and 
helped to form a real estate corpora- 
tion for this purpose. The Public 
Realty Company, Inc. was formed in 
1920. ‘The capital only amounted to 
six hundred dollars at first, but the 
company immediately began to acquire 
property. Its holdings now consist of 
two six family houses, a garage and a 
one family house. The initial capital 
has increased until it now amounts to 

forty thousand dollars.

cital of these facts? It would not be 
amiss to write this story just to praise 
the successful efforts of an amibitioys 
man, but our interest.goes further than 
that. Albert Cook, in company with 
other men, is proving the capacity of 
the colored people to engage in busi. 
ness. This is by far the most im. 
portant contribution that a Negro can 
make to racial progress. In the next 
decade the path of colored people in 
America will be made easier because 
of the work done by our business pio- 
neers today. When we have created 
new economic opportunities, we can 
then develop our spiritual and cultural 
resources to their fullest. We will be 
able to support our singers and writers 
and not leave them to sell their wares 
to an uncertain white public. Some 
will consider this peering into the dis- 
tant future, but it must be admitted 
that no people can entirely free them- 
selves until they have built a strong 
economic foundation. The accom-

will prepare us for better conditions

ents behind me. I thought the edu- 
cation of the children came first. 

Of course my Southern family is 
bitterly opposed to my efforts, but that 
makes no difference. My problem 
now is where to take hold again next 
fall. If I teach in a white school the 
experience is sure to repeat itself. If 
! were married I would try working 
through normal friendships, but with 
my family feeling as they do, it is 
necessary for me to find some work by 
which I can support myself. 

A missionary agency which has a 
number of schools for Negroes in the 
South was anxious for me to teach in 
one of them. But I told them that I 
intended treating every member of the 
faculty the same and to choose my 
friends from congeniality alone and 
they are not so eager for my services 
now. I wish I knew what to do. 

I am writing this to you both to let 
you know a little of the difficulty that 
some of us face when we try to do 
something, and also to ask you for 
some suggestions. You have lived both 
in the North and in the South, and 
have taught in Atlanta University, and 
because you are older and wiser than 
I am, I am hoping that you can make 
me some practical suggestions. = 

Please forgive all presumption 
this letter, as I desire only some sug- 
gestions as to what it would be possible 
for me to do next.
