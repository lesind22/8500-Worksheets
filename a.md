Welcome to my personal academic portfolio! I am a PhD student at Clemson University, studying Digital History. My interests are 19-20th century African American History with a concentration of film, media, and photography. 

Since a child I've always bee fascinated with African American culture, leading into my digital dissertation project that focuses on JET and Ebony magazines and it's affect on African American beauty. Aspiring to be a digital cultural historian, I believe in order to move to the next level technology/software must be accessible and digestable for the next generation.
